AB Chief executives in many parliamentary democracies have the power to
   dissolve the legislature. Despite a well-developed literature on the
   endogenous timing of parliamentary elections, political scientists know
   remarkably little about the strategic use of dissolution power to
   influence policymaking. To address this gap, we propose and empirically
   evaluate a theoretical model of legislative bargaining in the shadow of
   executive dissolution power. The model implies that the chief
   executive's public support and legislative strength, as well as the time
   until the next constitutionally mandated election, are important
   determinants of the use and effectiveness of dissolution threats in
   policymaking. Analyzing an original time-series data set from a
   multiparty parliamentary democracy, we find evidence in line with key
   empirical implications of the model.

AB Previous studies report that semi-democratic regimes are less durable
   than both democracies and autocracies. Still, mixing democratic and
   autocratic characteristics need not destabilize regimes, as three highly
   plausible alternative explanations of this correlation remain
   unaccounted for: (a) semi-democracies emerge under conditions of
   political instability and social turmoil; (b) other regime
   characteristics explain duration; and (c) extant democracy measures do
   not register all regime changes. We elaborate on and test for these
   explanations, but find strikingly robust evidence that semi-democracies
   are inherently less durable than both democracies and autocracies.
   Semi-democracies are particularly unstable political regimes should thus
   be considered a rare stylized fact of comparative politics. The analysis
   yields several other interesting results. For instance, autocracies and
   semi-democracies are equally likely to experience liberalizing regime
   changes more specifically, and once accounting for differences in degree
   of democracy, there is no robust evidence of differences in duration
   between military and single-party regimes.

AB In a laboratory experiment, we explore the effects of group identities
   on the principal-agent relationship between voters and representatives.
   In an adverse selection framework with observable effort, voters can
   choose to condition their reelection choices on representatives' effort
   alone, beliefs about representatives' competence, or both of those
   jointly. We show that inducing social identities increases the weight of
   representatives' effort in voters' reelection decisions. Further, when
   voters and representatives share a social identity, representatives tend
   to invest less effort and their effort is independent of their
   competence. In contrast, out-group representatives compensate for lower
   competence with higher effort and reduce effort when voters are likely
   to perceive them as competent. Voters often adopt laxer retention
   standards for representatives who are fellow group members and are
   responsive to evidence of other-regardingness from out-group
   representatives, but some voters actively resist treating
   representatives with shared identity more favorably and overcorrect as a
   consequence.

AB When defined in terms of social identity and affect toward copartisans
   and opposing partisans, the polarization of the American electorate has
   dramatically increased. We document the scope and consequences of
   affective polarization of partisans using implicit, explicit, and
   behavioral indicators. Our evidence demonstrates that hostile feelings
   for the opposing party are ingrained or automatic in voters' minds, and
   that affective polarization based on party is just as strong as
   polarization based on race. We further show that party cues exert
   powerful effects on nonpolitical judgments and behaviors. Partisans
   discriminate against opposing partisans, doing so to a degree that
   exceeds discrimination based on race. We note that the willingness of
   partisans to display open animus for opposing partisans can be
   attributed to the absence of norms governing the expression of negative
   sentiment and that increased partisan affect provides an incentive for
   elites to engage in confrontation rather than cooperation.

AB We examine the impact of political turnover on economic performance in a
   setting of largely unanticipated political change and profoundly weak
   institutions: the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine. Exploiting
   census-type panel data on over 7,000 manufacturing enterprises, we find
   that the productivity of firms in the regions most supportive of Viktor
   Yushchenko increased by more than 15 percentage points in the three
   years following his election, relative to that in the most
   anti-Yushchenko regions. We conclude that this effect is driven
   primarily by particularistic rather than general economic policies that
   disproportionately increased output among large enterprises, government
   suppliers, and private enterprisesthree types of firms that had much to
   gain or lose from turnover at the national level. Our results
   demonstrate that political turnover in the context of weak institutions
   can have substantial distributional effects that are reflected in
   economic productivity.

AB Legislators claim that how they explain their votes matters as much as
   or more than the roll calls themselves. However, few studies have
   systematically examined legislators' explanations and citizen attitudes
   in response to these explanations. We theorize that legislators
   strategically tailor explanations to constituents in order to compensate
   for policy choices that are incongruent with constituent preferences,
   and to reinforce policy choices that are congruent. We conduct a
   within-subjects field experiment using U.S. senators as subjects to test
   this hypothesis. We then conduct a between-subjects survey experiment of
   ordinary people to see how they react to the explanatory strategies used
   by senators in the field experiment. We find that most senators tailor
   their explanations to their audiences, and that these tailored
   explanations are effective at currying supportespecially among people
   who disagree with the legislators' roll-call positions.

AB How do parties decide which issues to emphasize during electoral
   competition? We argue that the answer to this question depends on how
   parties of the left and of the right respond to economic inequality.
   Increasing inequality shifts the proportion of the population falling
   into lower socioeconomic categories, thereby increasing the size of the
   electoral constituency that is receptive toward leftist parties'
   redistributive economic appeals. In the face of rising inequality, then,
   leftist parties will emphasize economic issues in their manifestos. By
   contrast, the nonredistributive economic policies often espoused by
   rightist parties will not appeal to this burgeoning constituency.
   Rather, we argue, rightist parties will opt to emphasize values-based
   issues, especially in those cases where social demand in the electorate
   for values-based representation is high. We find support for these
   relationships with hierarchical regression models that draw from data
   across hundreds of parties in a diverse set of the world's democracies.

AB Aldrich-McKelvey scaling is a powerful method that corrects for
   differential-item functioning (DIF) in estimating the positions of
   political stimuli (e.g., parties and candidates) and survey respondents
   along a latent policy dimension from issue scale data. DIF arises when
   respondents interpret issue scales (e.g., the standard
   liberal-conservative scale) differently and distort their placements of
   the stimuli and themselves. We develop a Bayesian implementation of the
   classical maximum likelihood Aldrich-McKelvey scaling method that
   overcomes some important shortcomings in the classical procedure. We
   then apply this method to study citizens' ideological preferences and
   perceptions using data from the 2004-2012 American National Election
   Studies and the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Our
   findings indicate that DIF biases self-placements on the
   liberal-conservative scale in a way that understates the extent of
   polarization in the contemporary American electorate and that citizens
   have remarkably accurate perceptions of the ideological positions of
   senators and Senate candidates.

AB For over a half century, various fields in the behavioral and social
   sciences have debated the appropriateness of null hypothesis
   significance testing (NHST) in the presentation and assessment of
   research results. A long list of criticisms has fueled the so-called
   significance testing controversy. The conventional NHST framework
   encourages researchers to devote excessive attention to statistical
   significance while underemphasizing practical (e.g., scientific,
   substantive, social, political) significance. I introduce a simple,
   intuitive approach that grounds testing in subject-area expertise,
   balancing the dual concerns of detectability and importance. The
   proposed practical and statistical significance test allows the social
   scientist to test for real-world significance, taking into account both
   sampling error and an assessment of what parameter values should be
   deemed interesting, given theory. The matter of what constitutes
   practical significance is left in the hands of the researchers
   themselves, to be debated as a natural component of inference and
   interpretation.

   individuals with greater endorsement of developmental idealism in 2008
   were more likely by 2012 to choose their own spouse, including a spouse
   of a different caste, rather than have an arranged marriage. Those with
   salaried work experience were also less likely to have arranged
   marriages, but urban proximity and education were not significant. The

AB Tools from the study of neighborhood effects, place distinction, and
   regional identity are employed in an ethnography of four small cities
   with growing populations of lesbian, bisexual, and queer-identified
   (LBQ) women to explain why orientations to sexual identity are
   relatively constant within each site, despite informants' within-city
   demographic heterogeneity, but vary substantially across the sites,
   despite common place-based attributes. The author introduces the concept
   of "sexual identity cultures"-and reveals the defining role of cities in
   shaping their contours. She finds that LBQ numbers and acceptance, place
   narratives, and newcomers' encounters with local social attributes serve
   as touchstones. The article looks beyond major categorical differences
   (e.g., urban/rural) to understand how and why identities evolve and vary
   and to reveal the fundamental interplay of demographic, cultural, and
   other city features previously thought isolatable. The findings
   challenge notions of identity as fixed and emphasize the degree to which
   self-understanding and group understanding remain collective

AB Based on focus groups and interviews with student renters in an Israeli
   slum, the article explores the contributions of differences in sonic
   styles and sensibilities to boundary work, social categorization, and
   evaluation. Alongside visual cues such as broken windows, bad
   neighborhoods are characterized by sonic cues, such as shouts from
   windows. Students understand "being ghetto" as being loud in a
   particular way and use loudness as a central resource in their boundary
   work. Loudness is read as a performative index of class and ethnicity,
   and the performance of middle-class studentship entails being appalled
   by stigmatized sonic practices and participating in their exoticization.
   However, the sonic is not merely yet another resource of boundary work.
   Paying sociological attention to senses other than vision reveals
   complex interactions between structures anchored in the body, structures
   anchored in language, and actors' identification strategies, which may
   refine theorizations of the body and the senses in social theory.

   (1) the preference configuration of the political actors and (2) the
   legislative procedures used in a particular period. Actors' preferences
   and procedures are not expected to have any effect beyond their impact
   on the gridlock interval. The study predicts smaller gridlock intervals,
   and thus more legislative activity, under the co-decision (consultation)
   procedure when the pivotal member states and the European Parliament
   (Commission) are closer to each other. More activity is expected under
   qualified majority voting in the Council than under unanimity. The

AB National governments have intensified their attempts to create
   international institutions in various policy fields such as the
   environment, finance and trade. At the same time, many subnational
   policy makers have begun to duplicate international efforts by setting
   their own, stricter policies while others remain inactive or enact more
   lax regulation. This 'glocalization' of policy creates a complex and
   potentially costly patchwork system of regulations. To shed light on
   this phenomenon, this article analyzes the interaction between
   subnational and national governments within a game-theoretic model of
   international treaty negotiations. The glocalization of regulatory
   policy can be understood as an attempt by subnational policy makers to
   strategically constrain or empower national governments in international
   negotiations. The study finds that the shadow of international treaty
   formation gives rise to within-country and cross-country policy
   balancing dynamics that may explain some of the subnational policy
   polarization that is currently observable in many countries. The article
   specifies the conditions under which these dynamics occur, spells out
   empirically testable hypotheses and identifies possible theoretical
   extensions.

   - and not necessarily to the belligerents. The article also claims that,
   in contrast to the prevailing view, considerations of jus post bellum do
   not play any moral role in the justifiability of a war. Accordingly,

AB Although the politics of law and order are currently a major issue of

   largely neglected it. This article fills that gap by bringing together
   criminological and public policy theories, and by examining
   law-and-order policies in twenty Western industrialized countries. It
   adds to the existing literature in two important ways: it provides a
   straightforward quantitative test of the existing criminological
   explanations of law-and-order policies using public spending as the
   dependent variable; and it shows that governments' partisan ideology
   matters for law-and-order policies. Government ideology influences how
   much countries spend on public order and safety, but the effect depends

AB What affects who participates in politics? In most studies of political
   behaviour it is found that individuals with higher education participate
   to a larger extent in political activities than individuals with lower
   education. According to conventional wisdom, education is supposed to
   increases civic skills and political knowledge that functions as the
   causal mechanisms triggering participation. However, recently a number
   of studies have started dealing with the question of whether education
   is a direct cause for political participation or merely works as a proxy
   for other factors, such as pre-adult socialization or social network
   centrality. This review article provides an introduction and critical
   discussion of this debate.

AB I study a general class of noisy rational expectations models that nests
   the standard Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) and Hellwig (1980) models, but
   relaxes the usual assumption of joint normality of asset pay-offs and
   supply, and allows for more general signal structures. I provide a
   constructive proof of existence of equilibrium, characterize the price
   function, and provide sufficient conditions for uniqueness within the
   class of equilibria with continuous price functions, which are met by
   both the Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) models and the Hellwig (1980)
   models with a continuum of investors. My solution approach does not rely
   on the typical "conjecture and verify" method, and I exhibit a number of
   non-normal examples in which asset prices can be characterized
   explicitly and in a closed form. The results presented here open up a
   broad class of models for applied work. To illustrate the usefulness of
   generalizing the standard model, I show that in settings with
   non-normally distributed pay-offs, shocks to fundamentals may be
   amplified purely due to learning effects, price drifts can arise
   naturally, and the disagreement-return relation depends in a novel way
   on return skewness.

AB We argue that one major cause of the U.S. post-war baby boom was the
   rise in female labour supply during World War II. We develop a
   quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous fertility
   and female labour force participation decisions. We use the model to
   assess the impact of the war on female labour supply and fertility in
   the decades following the war. For the war generation of women, the high
   demand for female labour brought about by mobilization leads to an
   increase in labour supply that persists after the war. As a result,
   younger women who reach adulthood in the 1950s face increased labour
   market competition, which impels them to exit the labour market and
   start having children earlier. The effect is amplified by the rise in
   taxes necessary to pay down wartime government debt. In our calibrated
   model, the war generates a substantial baby boom followed by a baby
   bust.

   governance of those who are informed but disengaged and, especially,
   those who are engaged but use false 'knowledge'. Poll data show the
   extent of Americans' misinformation about, or disengagement with,
   climate change. The main responsibility for these problems lies with
   politicians, who have partisan incentives to help the disengaged become
   active, but also partisan incentives to keep the misinformed politically
   involved. Activity in accord with false 'knowledge' can slow needed
   responses to global warming and lead to concrete harm to individuals,

AB This article overviews the history of autocratic elections since 1815
   and then tests how a country's experience with autocratic elections
   influences both democratization and democratic survival. To
   comprehensively capture this history, the study employs original
   measures of Robert Dahl's electoral dimensions of contestation and
   participation. First, it shows that autocratic elections have been
   common for centuries, but that their character has changed dramatically
   over time. Whereas high contestation almost always preceded high
   participation prior to 1940, the opposite occurs in modern regimes.
   Secondly, it demonstrates that a country's history of contestation
   predicts both democratization and democratic survival, whereas
   participation is positive for survival but generally negative for
   democratization. Thus, democracies are more likely to survive if they
   experience autocratic elections prior to democratizing, which has
   implications for democracy promotion and future political development.

AB Many developed democracies are experiencing high immigration, and public
   attitudes likely shape their policy responses. Prior studies of
   ethnocentrism and stereotyping make divergent predictions about
   anti-immigration attitudes. Some contend that culturally distinctive
   immigrants consistently generate increased opposition; others predict
   that natives' reactions depend on the particular cultural distinction
   and associated stereotypes. This article tests these hypotheses using
   realistic, video-based experiments with representative American samples.
   The results refute the expectation that more culturally distinctive
   immigrants necessarily induce anti-immigration views: exposure to Latino
   immigrants with darker skin tones or who speak Spanish does not increase
   restrictionist attitudes. Instead, the impact of out-group cues hinges
   on their content and related norms, as immigrants who speak accented
   English seem to counteract negative stereotypes related to immigrant
   assimilation.

AB The shift away from school desegregation policies toward market-based
   reforms necessitates a deeper understanding of the social and
   institutional forces driving contemporary school segregation. The author
   conceptualizes school segregation as a mode of monopolistic closure amid
   status competition, where racial/ethnic groups compete for school-based
   status and resources. He tests the theory by analyzing primary and
   secondary school segregation throughout the United States from 1993 to
   2010. Findings support the hypotheses that segregation increases with
   the salience of race/ethnicity and the decentralization of school
   systems, which fuels differentiation and provides incentives and
   opportunities to monopolize schools. Parallel findings for black-white,
   Hispanic-white, and black-Hispanic segregation suggest that a core set
   of processes drives school segregation as a general phenomenon.

AB How do gender relations regulate the American state? To answer this
   question the author examines archival material on the formation and
   operation of the Selective Service System during World War I, the
   understudied federal American draft system. She shows how the federal
   government vested local draft board members with the authority to
   determine on a subjective, case-by-case basis whether potential draftees
   were genuine breadwinners in determining whom to draft and who would
   receive dependency-based deferments. Informal rules of thumb about the
   gender-ordered family structured the First World War draft. By analyzing
   the Selective Service System and by placing feminist political
   sociology, scholarship in the American political development tradition,
   and Weberian scholarship on the modern state in critical dialogue with
   one another, the author identifies how the American state's locally
   applied substantive rationality relied on the family's gender hierarchy
   in ordering its rational informality. Gender relations thereby
   rationalized the state's local informality.

AB Can we identify and theorize contingency as a property of processes and
   situations? Applied to social and historical events, contingency denotes
   a mode of causality characterized by its indeterminate character.
   Conjunctural causation and period effects lack the specificity required
   to identify a distinctive class of processes. References to chance
   happenings offer no clue to analyze endogenous disruptions. Focusing on
   breaks in patterns of social relations and the role played by individual
   agency, the author distinguishes four types of impact-pyramidal,
   pivotal, sequential, and epistemic-and investigates how these relate to
   the possibility of indeterminacy through an Event Structure Analysis of
   the night of August 4, 1789, in Versailles. This empirical foray
   underscores the significance of junctures that are indeterminate with
   respect to their collective outcomes. The article grounds analytically
   this class of conjunctures with the concept of mutual uncertainty,
   gauges the phenomenal scope of this contingency in terms of action
   domains and group types, contrasts it with the notion of chance events,
   and draws its implications for the study of social and historical
   change.

AB This paper studies regulated health insurance markets known as
   exchanges, motivated by the increasingly important role they play in
   both public and private insurance provision. We develop a framework that
   combines data on health outcomes and insurance plan choices for a
   population of insured individuals with a model of a competitive
   insurance exchange to predict outcomes under different exchange designs.
   We apply this framework to examine the effects of regulations that
   govern insurers' ability to use health status information in pricing. We
   investigate the welfare implications of these regulations with an
   emphasis on two potential sources of inefficiency: (i) adverse selection
   and (ii) premium reclassification risk. We find substantial adverse
   selection leading to full unraveling of our simulated exchange, even
   when age can be priced. While the welfare cost of adverse selection is
   substantial when health status cannot be priced, that of
   reclassification risk is five times larger when insurers can price based
   on some health status information. We investigate several extensions
   including (i) contract design regulation, (ii) self-insurance through
   saving and borrowing, and (iii) insurer risk adjustment transfers.

AB This paper develops a new model for empirically analyzing dynamic
   matching in the marriage market and then applies that model to recent
   changes in the U.S. marriage distribution. Its primary objective is to
   estimate gains by age from being married today (till death of at least
   one spouse) relative to remaining single for that same time period. An
   empirical methodology that relies on the model's equilibrium outcomes
   identifies the marriage gains using a single cross-section of observed
   aggregate matches. This behavioral dynamic model rationalizes a new
   marriage matching function. The model also solves the inverse problem of
   computing the vector of aggregate marriages, given a new distribution of
   available single individuals and estimated preferences. Finally, this
   paper develops a simple test of the model's empirical validity. Using
   aggregate data of new marriages and available single men and women in
   the United States over two decades from 1970 to 1990, I investigate the
   changes in marriage gains over this period.

   to people who value both commitment and flexibility and whose

   inconsistency is observable, both a planner and a monopolist provide
   devices that help each person commit to the efficient level of
   flexibility. However, the combination of unobservable time inconsistency
   and preference for flexibility causes an adverse-selection problem. To
   solve this problem, the monopolist and (possibly) the planner curtail
   flexibility in the device for a more inconsistent person at both ends of
   the efficient choice range; moreover, they may have to add unused
   options to the device for a less inconsistent person and also distort
   his actual choices. This theory has normative and positive implications
   for private and public provision of commitment devices.

AB We propose a novel technique to boost the power of testing a
   high-dimensional vector H:=0 against sparse alternatives where the null
   hypothesis is violated by only a few components. Existing tests based on
   quadratic forms such as the Wald statistic often suffer from low powers
   due to the accumulation of errors in estimating high-dimensional
   parameters. More powerful tests for sparse alternatives such as
   thresholding and extreme value tests, on the other hand, require either
   stringent conditions or bootstrap to derive the null distribution and
   often suffer from size distortions due to the slow convergence. Based on
   a screening technique, we introduce a power enhancement component, which
   is zero under the null hypothesis with high probability, but diverges
   quickly under sparse alternatives. The proposed test statistic combines
   the power enhancement component with an asymptotically pivotal
   statistic, and strengthens the power under sparse alternatives. The null
   distribution does not require stringent regularity conditions, and is
   completely determined by that of the pivotal statistic. The proposed
   methods are then applied to testing the factor pricing models and
   validating the cross-sectional independence in panel data models.

   explanatory variable of interest, and it is particularly suitable for
   applications in which that variable has bunching points. An application
   of the test to the problem of estimating the effects of maternal smoking

   Specifically, center dot We define a sequence of monotonically
   increasing revenue benchmarks for single-good auctions, G(0)G(1)G(2),

   individually rational, auction mechanism that, without any clue about
   the rationality level of the players, guarantees revenue G(k) if all
   players have rationality levels k+1, and (2) prove that no such
   mechanism can guarantee revenue even close to G(k) when at least two
   players are at most level-k rational.

   solid foundation for the Nash bargaining with endogenous threats
   solution. Analogous reasoning is then applied to an infinite horizon
   game to provide equilibrium selection in two-person repeated games with

   the roles of financial constraints and creditor-debtor dependences, we
   infer that the trade credit failure propagation mechanism is driven by

   paper is that under certain assumptions, the limiting distribution of
   the LS estimator is independent of the number of factors used in the
   estimation as long as this number is not underestimated. The important
   practical implication of this result is that for inference on the

AB Though political scientists generally understand the origins of
   native-born reactions to foreigners, less is known about how
   anti-immigrant contexts trigger a political response within immigrant
   groups. I address this question by studying the connection between
   xenophobic rhetoric and Latino politics. I claim that xenophobic
   rhetoric raises the salience of ethnic identity and impugns its worth.
   This identity threat leads high-identifying group members to engage in
   political efforts that assert their group's positive value, whereas low
   identifiers shun political opportunities to bolster their group's
   devaluation. I test these claims with an experiment embedded in a
   nationally representative opinion survey of Latino adults. In light of
   xenophobic rhetoric, I find that relative to low identifiers,
   high-identifying Latinos become less politically trusting, more
   ethnocentric, and increasingly supportive of policies that emphasize
   ingroup pride. These results clarify xenophobic rhetoric's role in
   amplifying the influence of ethnic identity on immigrant politics.

AB Partisans often perceive real world conditions in a manner that credits
   their own party. Yet recent findings suggest that partisans are capable
   of setting their loyalties aside when confronted with clear evidence,
   for example, during an economic crisis. This study examines a different
   possibility. While partisans may acknowledge the same reality, they may
   find other ways of aligning undeniable realities with their party
   loyalties. Using monthly survey data collected before and after the
   unexpected collapse of the British national economy (2004-10), this
   study presents one key finding: As partisans came to agree that economic
   conditions had gotten much worse, they conversely polarized in whether
   they thought the government was responsible. While the most committed
   partisans were surprisingly apt in acknowledging the economic collapse,
   they were also the most eager to attribute responsibility selectively.
   For that substantial share of the electorate, partisan-motivated
   reasoning seems highly adaptive.

AB Research on young-adult sexuality in sub-Saharan Africa typically
   conceptualizes sex as an individual-level risk behavior. We introduce a
   new approach that connects the conditions surrounding the initiation of
   sex with subsequent relationship well-being, examines relationships as
   sequences of interdependent events, and indexes relationship experiences
   to individually held ideals. New card-sort data from southern Malawi
   capture young women's relationship experiences and their ideals in a
   sequential framework. Using optimal matching, we measure the distance
   between ideal and experienced relationship sequences to (1) assess the
   associations between ideological congruence and perceived relationship
   well-being, (2) compare this ideal-based approach to other
   experience-based alternatives, and (3) identify individual- and
   couple-level correlates of congruence between ideals and experiences in
   the romantic realm. We show that congruence between ideals and
   experiences conveys relationship well-being along four dimensions:
   expressions of love and support, robust communication habits, perceived
   biological safety, and perceived relationship stability. We further show
   that congruence is patterned by socioeconomic status and supported by
   shared ideals within romantic dyads. We argue that conceiving of ideals
   as anchors for how sexual experiences are manifest advances current
   understandings of romantic relationships, and we suggest that this
   approach has applications for other domains of life.

AB Patrilineality, the organization of kinship, inheritance, and other key
   social processes based on patrilineal male descent, has been a salient
   feature of social organization in China and many other societies for
   centuries. Because patrilineage continuity or growth was the central
   focus of reproductive strategies in such societies, we introduce the
   number of patrilineal male descendants generations later as a
   stratification outcome. By reconstructing and analyzing 20,000
   patrilineages in two prospective, multi-generational population
   databases from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century China, we show that
   patrilineages founded by high-status males had higher growth rates for
   the next 150 years. The elevated growth rate of these patrilineages was
   due more to their having a lower probability of extinction at each point
   in time than to surviving patrilineal male descendants having larger
   numbers of sons on average. As a result, male descendants of high-status
   males account for a disproportionately large share of the male
   population in later generations. In China and elsewhere, patrilineal kin
   network characteristics influence individuals' life chances; effects of
   a male founder's characteristics on patrilineage size many generations
   later thus represent an indirect channel of status transmission that has
   not been considered previously.

AB Despite growing research on health and residential contexts, relatively
   little is understood about gendered contexts that are differentially
   important for women's and men's physical health in low- and
   middle-income countries. This study advances the prior knowledge by
   examining whether the local frequency of a salient and gendered practice
   in India-dowry-is associated with gender differences in physical health
   (acute illness, illness length, and chronic illness). Analyses are
   conducted using multilevel logistic and negative binomial regression
   models and national data on men and women across India
   (NaEuro...=aEuro...102,763). Results show that as dowry frequency
   increases in communities, not only do women have a greater likelihood of
   poor health across all three health outcomes, but men also have a
   greater likelihood of acute illness and illness length. Men, however,
   have a lower likelihood of chronic illness as the frequency of dowry
   increases in communities. In the case of all three health outcomes,
   results showed consistently wider health gaps between men and women in
   communities with a higher frequency of dowry.

AB Many areas of political science focus on causal questions. Evidence from

   relationships. While statistical analyses can help establish causal
   relationships, it can also provide strong evidence of causality where
   none exists. In this essay, I provide an overview of the statistics of
   causal inference. Instead of focusing on specific statistical methods,
   such as matching, I focus more on the assumptions needed to give
   statistical estimates a causal interpretation. Such assumptions are
   often referred to as identification assumptions, and these assumptions
   are critical to any statistical analysis about causal effects. I outline
   a wide range of identification assumptions and highlight the
   design-based approach to causal inference. I conclude with an overview
   of statistical methods that are frequently used for causal inference.

AB The accuracy of U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) demographic
   and financial forecasts is crucial for the solvency of its Trust Funds,
   other government programs, industry decision-making, and the evidence
   base of many scholarly articles. Because SSA makes public insufficient
   replication information and uses antiquated statistical forecasting
   methods, no external group has ever been able to produce fully
   independent forecasts or evaluations of policy proposals to change the
   system. Yet, no systematic evaluation of SSA forecasts has ever been
   published by SSA or anyone else-until a companion paper to this one. We
   show that SSA's forecasting errors were approximately unbiased until
   about 2000, but then began to grow quickly, with increasingly
   overconfident uncertainty intervals. Moreover, the errors are largely in
   the same direction, making the Trust Funds look healthier than they are.
   We extend and then explain these findings with evidence from a large
   number of interviews with participants at every level of the forecasting
   and policy processes. We show that SSA's forecasting procedures meet all
   the conditions the modern social-psychology and statistical literatures
   demonstrate make bias likely. When those conditions mixed with potent
   new political forces trying to change Social Security, SSA's actuaries
   hunkered down, trying hard to insulate their forecasts from strong
   political pressures. Unfortunately, this led the actuaries into not
   incorporating the fact that retirees began living longer lives and
   drawing benefits longer than predicted. We show that fewer than 10% of
   their scorings of major policy proposals were statistically different
   from random noise as estimated from their policy forecasting error. We
   also show that the solution to this problem involves SSA or Congress
   implementing in government two of the central projects of political
   science over the last quarter century: (1) transparency in data and
   methods and (2) replacing with formal statistical models large numbers
   of ad hoc qualitative decisions too complex for unaided humans to make
   optimally.

AB Spatial theories of lawmaking predict that legislative productivity is
   increasing in the number of status quo policies that lie outside the
   gridlock interval, but because locations of status quo policies are
   difficult to measure, previous empirical tests of gridlock theories rely
   on an auxiliary assumption that the distribution of status quo points is
   fixed and uniform. This assumption is at odds with the theories being
   tested, as it ignores the history dependence of lawmaking. We provide an
   alternative method for testing competing theories by estimating
   structural models that explicitly account for temporal dependence in a
   theoretically consistent way. Our analysis suggests that legislative
   productivity depends both on parties and supermajority pivots, and we
   find patterns of productivity consistent with a weaker, contingent form
   of party influence than found in previous work. Parties appear to exert
   agenda power only on highly salient legislation rather than strongly
   influencing outcomes through voting pressure and party unity.

AB Duration data are often subject to various forms of censoring that
   require adaptations of the likelihood function to properly capture the
   data generating process, but existing spatial duration models do not yet
   account for these potential issues. Here, we develop a method to
   estimate spatial-lag duration models when the outcome suffers from right
   censoring, the most common form of censoring. We adapt Wei and Tanner's
   (1991) imputation algorithm for censored (non-spatial) regression data
   to models of spatially interdependent durations. The algorithm treats
   the unobserved duration outcomes as censored data and iterates between
   multiple imputation of the incomplete, that is, right censored, values
   and estimation of the spatial duration model using these imputed values.
   We explore the performance of an estimator for log-normal durations in
   the face of varying degrees of right censoring via Monte Carlo and
   provide empirical examples of its estimation by analyzing spatial
   dependence in states' entry dates into World War I.

AB In most multidimensional spatial models, the systematic component of
   agent utility functions is specified as additive separable. We argue
   that this assumption is too restrictive, at least in the context of
   spatial voting in mass elections. Here, assuming separability would
   stipulate that voters do not care about how policy platforms combine
   positions on multiple policy dimensions. We present a statistical
   implementation of Davis, Hinich, and Ordeshook's (1970) Weighted
   Euclidean Distance model that allows for the estimation of the direction
   and magnitude of non-separability from vote choice data. We demonstrate
   in a Monte-Carlo experiment that conventional separable model
   specifications yield biased and/or unreliable estimates of the effect of
   policy distances on vote choice probabilities in the presence of
   non-separable preferences. In three empirical applications, we find
   voter preferences on economic and socio-cultural issues to be
   nonseparable. If non-separability is unaccounted for, researchers run
   the risk of missing crucial parts of the story. The implications of our
   findings carry over to other fields of research: checking for
   non-separability is an essential part of robustness testing in empirical
   applications of multidimensional spatial models.

AB The strategic nature of political interactions has long captured the
   attention of political scientists. A traditional statistical approach to
   modeling strategic interactions involves multi-stage estimation, which
   improves parameter estimates associated with one stage by using the
   information from other stages. The application of such multi-stage
   approaches, however, imposes rather strict demands on data availability:
   data on the dependent variable must be available for each strategic
   actor at each stage of the interaction. Limited or no data make such
   approaches difficult or impossible to implement. Political science data,
   however, especially in the fields of international relations and
   comparative politics, are not always structured in a manner that is
   conducive to these approaches. For example, we observe and have
   plentiful data on the onset of civil wars, but not the preceding stages,
   in which opposition groups decide to rebel or governments decide to
   repress them. In this article, I derive an estimator that
   probabilistically estimates unobserved actor choices related to earlier
   stages of strategic interactions. I demonstrate the advantages of the
   estimator over traditional and split-population binary estimators both
   using Monte Carlo simulations and a substantive example of the strategic
   rebel-government interaction associated with civil wars.

AB Over the past several years, there has been growing use of the draft
   lottery instrument to study political attitudes and behaviors (see,
   e.g., Bergan 2009; Erikson and Stoker 2011; Henderson 2012; Davenport
   2015). Draft lotteries, held in the United States from 1969 to 1972,
   provide a potentially powerful design; in theory, they should provide
   true randomization for the "treatment" of military service or behavioral
   reactions to the threat of such service. However, the first draft
   lottery conducted in 1969 was not conducted in a random manner, giving
   those citizens born in the fourth quarter of the year disproportionately
   higher chances of being drafted. In this note, we describe the
   randomization failure and discuss how this failure could in theory
   compromise the use of draft lottery numbers as an instrumental variable.
   We then use American National Election Studies data to provide support
   for the conclusion that individuals most affected by the randomization
   failure (those born in the fourth quarter of the year) largely do not
   look statistically distinct from those born at other times of the year.
   With some caveats, researchers should be able to treat the 1969 draft
   numbers as if they were assigned at random. We also discuss broader
   lessons to draw from this example, both for scholars interested in using
   the draft lottery as an instrumental variable, and for researchers
   leveraging other instruments with randomization failures. Specifically,
   we suggest that scholars should pay particular attention to the sources
   of randomization failure, sample attrition, treatment and dependent
   variable selection, and possible failure of the exclusion restriction,
   and we outline ways in which these problems may apply to the draft
   lottery instrument and other natural experiments.

AB This text reports the results of an evaluation of the performance of
   multilevel regression modeling and poststratication (MRP) in
   reconstructing state-level estimates from federal-level data. The
   evaluation makes use of Eurobarometer data and relies on the fact that
   Eurobarometer provides representative survey data for each European
   Union state to further explore the performance of MRP. I repeatedly draw
   subsets of the entire Eurobarometer sample, then I compute adjusted
   country means using MRP with census data, and I compare the resulting
   estimates to the true country means from the full sample. I do that for
   ten survey items from various Eurobarometer waves. The results show that
   MRP is generally successful in producing estimates that are highly
   correlated with the true values (mean of 0.90). But the approach is less
   capable of reconstructing the relative rankings of the country means and
   hitting the range of plausible values of the individual state means. I
   also show that the great part of the adjustment comes from the modeling
   of the state means and not from poststratification, and that
   population-weighted samples perform no worse than samples in which
   countries have equal shares of the pool of respondents.

AB Courts of last resort in the American states offer researchers
   considerable leverage to develop and test theories about how
   institutions influence judicial behavior. One measure critical to this
   research agenda is the individual judges' preferences, or ideal points,
   in policy space. Two main strategies for recovering this measure exist
   in the literature: Brace, Langer, and Hall's (2000, Measuring
   preferences of state supreme court judges, Journal of Politics 62(2):
   387-413) Party-Adjusted Judge Ideology and Bonica and Woodruff's (2014,
   A common-space measure of state supreme court ideology, Journal of Law,
   Economics, & Organization, doi: 10.1093/jleo/ewu016) judicial CFscores.
   Here, we introduce a third measurement strategy that combines CFscores
   with item response (IRT) estimates of judicial voting behavior in all
   fifty-two state courts of last resort from 1995 to 2010. We show that
   leveraging two distinct sources of information (votes and CFscores)
   yields a superior estimation strategy. Specifically, we highlight
   several key advantages of the combined measure: (1) it is estimated
   dynamically, allowing for the possibility that judges' ideological
   leanings change over time and (2) it maps judges into a common space. In
   a comparison against existing measurement strategies, we find that our
   measure offers superior performance in predicting judges' votes. We
   conclude that it is a valuable tool for advancing the study of judicial
   politics.

   findings reveal that ideology is a significant determinant of vote
   choice in Latin America. They also suggest that the success of leftist
   leaders at the polls reflects the views of the voters sustaining their
   victories. The location of parties and leaders reveals that three
   distinctive clusters exist: one located at the left of the political
   spectrum, another at the center, and a third on the right. The results
   also indicate that legislators in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru tend to be
   more "leftists" than their voters. The ideological drift, however, is
   not significant enough to substantiate the view that a disconnect
   between voters and politicians lies behind the success of leftist
   presidents in these countries. These findings highlight the importance
   of using a common-space scale to compare disparate populations and call

   examine the theoretical and empirical costs of treating regime type
   exogenously in the literature most identified with studying its impact
   on international politics. It argues that the apparent peace among
   democratic states that emerges in the aftermath of World War I is not
   caused by domestic institutional attributes normally associated with
   democracy. Instead, this peace is an artifact of historically specific
   great power settlements. These settlements shape subsequent aggregate
   patterns of military conflict by altering the organizational
   configuration of the system in three critical ways-by creating new
   states, by altering hierarchical orders, and by influencing regime type
   in states. These claims are defended with a series of tests that show
   first how the statistical relationship between democracy and peace has
   exhibited substantial variation across great power orders; second, that
   this statistical relationship breaks down with theoretically motivated
   research design changes; and third, that great powers foster peace and
   similar regime types within their hierarchical orders. In short, the
   relationship between democracy and peace is spurious. The international
   political order is still built and managed by great powers.

AB Common wisdom and current scholarship hold that governments need to
   stand firm in the face of secessionist demands, since permitting the
   secession of one region can set a precedent for others. For this reason
   governments will often choose blood rather than risk dissolution. I
   argue that administrative organization provides states with a third
   option. Those regions that represent a unique administrative type stand
   a much better chance of seceding peacefully. Moreover, large articulated
   states sometimes downsize by administrative category, which helps
   explain why governments will release one set of units without contest
   while preventing another set from doing the same. Finally, secessionist
   movements that do not cohere with any administrative region are the
   least likely to be granted independence. In sum, the administrative
   architecture of states provides governments with a means to discriminate
   between secessionist demands. I test this theory in a large-N study
   using original data on secessionist movements and administrative units
   between 1816 and 2011.

   make four central claims. First, in many studies involving the role of
   sex and gender in violence, specific causal models tend to remain
   underspecified. Second, a divergence in fundamental assumptions
   regarding the ontological basis of sex differences implicitly permeates
   and shatters this literature. Third, arguments that men and women are
   more or less likely to fight appear too simplistic; rather, it is worth
   considering that men and women may possess different motivations for
   fighting, and fight under different circumstances and for different
   reasons. Finally, systematic differences in the variant psychologies of
   men and women regarding the relative merit of offense and defense exert
   predictable consequences for public opinion surrounding the conduct of
   war in particular.

AB How effective is terrorism? This question has generated lively scholarly
   debate and is of obvious importance to policy-makers. However, most
   existing studies of terrorism are not well equipped to answer this
   question because they lack an appropriate comparison. This article
   compares the outcomes of civil wars to assess whether rebel groups that
   use terrorism fare better than those who eschew this tactic. I evaluate
   the advantages and disadvantages of terrorism relative to other tactics
   used in civil war. Because terrorism is not a tactic employed at random,
   I first briefly explore empirically which groups use terrorism.
   Controlling for factors that may affect both the use of terrorism and
   war outcomes, I find that although civil wars involving terrorism last
   longer than other wars, terrorist rebel groups are generally less likely
   to achieve their larger political objectives than are nonterrorist
   groups. Terrorism may be less ineffective against democracies, but even
   in this context, terrorists do not win.

AB An open question in nuclear deterrence theory is whether and how the
   balance of military power affects the dynamics of escalation. The
   balance of military strength plays virtually no role in standard
   accounts of brinkmanship. But this is largely by assumption and seems
   incompatible with an apparent trade-off between power and risk that
   decision makers have faced in some actual crises. This paper
   incorporates this trade-off in a modified model of nuclear brinkmanship.
   A main result is that the more likely the balance of resolve is to favor
   a defender, the less military power a challenger brings to bear. The
   model also formalizes the stability-instability paradox, showing that a
   less stable strategic balance, that is, a sharper trade-off between
   power and risk, makes conflict at high levels of violence less likely
   but conflict at lower levels more likely. The analysis also helps
   explain the incentives different states have to adopt different nuclear
   doctrines and force postures.

AB When it comes to linkages between migration and the global allocation of
   foreign development assistance, the size of the immigrant population
   from a recipient country residing in a donor country is an important
   determinant of dyadic aid commitments. Two complementary hypotheses
   probe this relationship. First, donors use foreign aid to achieve their
   broader immigration goals, targeting migrant-sending areas to increase
   development and decrease the demand for entry into the donor country.
   Second, migrants already residing in the donor country mobilize to lobby
   for additional aid for their homeland. Empirical tests on a large sample
   of country pairs made up of twenty-two donors and more than 150
   recipients over the period 1993 to 2008 show robust support for these
   hypotheses.

AB Status has long been implicated as a critical value of states and
   leaders in international politics. However, decades of research on the
   link between status and conflict have yielded divergent findings, and
   little evidence of a causal relationship. I attempt to resolve this
   impasse by shifting the focus from status to relative status concerns in
   building a theory of status from the ground up, beginning with its
   behavioral microfoundations. I build on and extend previous work through
   an experimental study of status threats and the escalation of
   commitment, operationalized here as a new behavioral escalation task
   using real financial incentives and framed around a narrative of war and
   peace. I utilize a unique sample of high-profile political and military
   leaders from the Senior Executive Fellow (SEF) program at the Harvard
   Kennedy School, as well as a group of demographically matched control
   subjects, allowing me to evaluate the moderating effect of power on
   status concerns while also addressing typical concerns about external
   validity in IR experiments. I find strong evidence that the fear of
   losing status impedes decision making and increases the tendency to
   "throw good money after bad," but that power aids decision making by
   buffering high-power subjects against the worst effects of status loss.

AB International arbitration is a distinctive feature of both contemporary
   international politics and the ancient world. Explanations of
   arbitration in the international relations literature generally posit
   that states engage in arbitration to mitigate the effects of competition
   in an anarchical system, or that the practice of arbitration reflects
   democratic norms. However, an examination of arbitration during the
   paradigmatic case of the Hellenistic period (338-90 BCE) casts doubt on
   the existing literature. Hierarchy rather than anarchy better
   characterizes the political context in which arbitration took place: the
   Greeks often organized themselves into alliances or leagues in which a
   hegemon dominated decision making, or into federal states with a common
   foreign policy. This hierarchical setting was a necessary condition for
   international arbitration where the practice of arbitration was a tool
   to legitimize hierarchical powers. We assemble an original data set of
   Hellenistic arbitrations, and use qualitative comparative analysis to
   show that hierarchy was almost always a necessary condition for
   international arbitration. Process-tracing of arbitration under three
   political orders-hegemonic kingdoms in the Greek world, Greek
   federations, and the Roman Empire-shows that arbitration as a particular
   means of dispute resolution was used as an ideological device to build
   and legitimize international order. We then analyze the contemporary
   record, finding a role for hierarchy in modern international
   arbitration.

AB Divorce increases the risk of loneliness. With divorce increasingly
   becoming a normal life event, societal changes are now challenging this
   idea as regards to current cohorts. We hypothesize that the relative
   strong feelings of loneliness among divorcees, compared with married
   people, has diminished over time. Using 1992, 2002, and 2012 data sets
   of 54-65-year-old people, we examine the impact of divorce on loneliness
   over 20 years. We compare those who are divorced or remarried to people
   married for the first time, and differentiate the supportiveness of the
   partnership. The results show that for both emotional and social
   loneliness, divorcees were lonelier than respondents in their first
   marriage; remarried divorces were socially lonelier than respondents in
   their first marriage. Respondents with a supportive partnership were
   less emotionally and socially lonely than respondents without a
   partnership or with a less supportive partnership. The main finding is
   that, compared with 1992, the divorcees are less socially lonely in
   2002, with a smaller and non-significant further decrease in loneliness
   in 2012. This suggests that the social position of divorcees has been
   improved over the past two decades.

AB The relative importance of homogamy in ascribed and achieved
   socio-economic status in contemporary partner selection is not well
   known. Few studies have explored to what extent these dimensions of
   homogamy overlap. To fill these gaps in our knowledge, this study
   examines homogamy in educational level and parental occupational class
   in Finland. The study uses excellent register data, which includes not
   only marriages but also nonmarital cohabiting unions. Log-linear models
   are applied to analyse homogamy in the unions of 30-year-old women (n =
   15,066). The results show that educational homogamy is overall stronger
   than homogamy in parental occupational class, and people with a higher
   university degree display the highest rates of homogamy. In the case of
   socio-economic origins, those from upper-white-collar and farmer
   families are particularly inclined towards in-group partner choice.
   Homogamy is not pervasive across all status groups: people from
   lower-white-collar families displayed no tendency towards homogamy, and
   the tendency was weak among those with an upper-secondary-level
   education. Also importantly, multivariate analyses show that educational
   homogamy and homogamy in parental social class are largely independent
   of one another. The latter two findings likely reflect the relatively
   egalitarian context of a Nordic welfare state.

AB Most people are unable to accurately estimate the number of immigrants
   in their country. Nonetheless, it has been argued that the size of the
   immigrant population would affect people's immigration attitudes. Part
   of the effect of immigration on attitudes occurs not so much because of
   real immigration figures, but rather because of media reporting about
   immigration. In this study, negative attitudes towards immigration are
   explained by investigating the impact of the salience and the tone of
   immigration topics in the news media vis-a-vis the impact of immigration
   statistics. The cases of Denmark and the Netherlands are analysed for a
   period from 2003 to 2010, using a multilevel design. Overall, real-world
   immigration numbers have little impact. The tone of news coverage has an
   effect in the Netherlands: a positive tone reduces negativity towards
   immigration, while a negative tone does not increase negativity. We
   cautiously conclude that the longevity of the issue's salience has a
   moderating effect.

AB Although gender inequalities in education have greatly changed in recent
   decades with young women outpacing young men, girls and boys continue to
   study in gender-typical fields of study. Recognizing that boys and girls
   might have different educational preferences, we conceptualized gender
   differentiation as an outcome of both socialization processes and
   rational choice factors. Using a data set from an original survey of
   curricular choices of high school students in Tel Aviv-Jaffa in Israel,
   we employed nested logit regression models using the KHB method to
   examine the determinants of the gender differentiation in advanced
   course-taking. We found that socialization mechanisms (significant other
   influences) and rational choice motivations (utility considerations and
   failure expectations) explain up to 40 percent of the gender-typical
   curricular choice in our data. The implications of these results for
   future research are discussed.

AB This paper uses age-period-cohort models to show that the living
   standards (total monetary incomes after public benefits and
   contributions, adjusted for household size and inflation) of successive
   birth cohorts in the United States and Germany are strongly correlated
   with general changes in disposable incomes. This means that, after
   introducing controls, virtually every successive birth cohort in Germany
   and the United States had increasing disposable incomes, similar to
   general rates of economic growth. For France, however, we find that,
   while disposable income increased through the 20th century, cohorts born
   before 1950 profited from this, while cohorts born after 1950 experience
   no improvement in living standards over previous cohorts, after
   adjusting disposable incomes for inflation and controls-mainly education
   and household composition. Thus, while economic growth benefits all
   birth cohorts in the United States and Germany, pre-1950 birth cohorts
   in France have monopolized lucrative positions and social transfers so
   that post-1950 birth cohorts do not benefit from economic growth.

AB We study the biases that arise in estimates of social inequalities in
   children's cognitive ability test scores due to (i) children's
   misreporting of socio-economic origin and (ii) parents' nonresponse.
   Unlike most previous studies, we are able to draw on linked register
   data with high reliability and almost no missingness and thereby jointly
   consider the impact of measurement error and nonresponse. Using data on
   14-year-olds (n = 18,716) from a new survey conducted in England,
   Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden (Children of Immigrants
   Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries), we find that child
   reports on parental occupation are well aligned with parents' reports in
   all countries, but reports on parental education less so. This leads to
   underestimation of socio-economic disparities when child reports of
   education are used, but not occupation. Selective nonresponse among
   parents turns out to be a real problem, resulting in similar
   underestimation. We also investigate conditional estimates of
   immigrant-non-immigrant disparities, which are surprisingly little
   affected by measurement error or nonresponse in socio-economic control
   variables. We conclude that school-based surveys on teenagers are well
   advised to include questions on parental occupation, while the costs for
   carrying out parental questionnaires may outweigh the gains.

AB Knowledge about how race governs partner selection has been
   predominantly studied in the United States, yet it is unclear whether
   these results can be generalized to nations with different racial and
   immigration patterns. Using a large-scale sample of online daters in
   nine European countries, we engage in the first cross-national analysis
   of race-related partner preferences and examine the link between
   contextual factors and ethnic selectivity. We provide a unique test of
   contact, conflict, and in-group identification theories. We show that
   individuals uniformly prefer to date same-race partners and that there
   is a hierarchy of preferences both among natives and minority groups.
   Notable country differences are also found. Europeans living in
   countries with a large foreign-born population have an increased
   preference for minority groups. The ethnically heterogeneous Swiss
   population displays the strongest preference for minorities, with the
   more homogenous Poland, Spain, and Italy, the least. Anti-immigrant
   attitudes are related to stronger in-group preferences among natives.
   Unexpectedly, non-Arabic minority daters belonging to large-size
   communities have strong preferences for Europeans. The results have
   implications for immigrant integration policies and demonstrate that
   Internet dating allows efficient selection by racial divisions,

AB Existing research has developed a wide range of evidence about
   predictors of perceived discrimination among minorities, but often
   generates conflicting evidence across studies. I claim this may be due
   to the measurement strategy. Existing research often uses
   cross-sectional surveys that ask minorities about their experiences with
   discrimination, but these questions cannot determine whether subjects
   with higher levels of perceived discrimination are more likely to
   experience discrimination or are just more likely to interpret events
   through the lens of discrimination. In this article, I propose a new
   strategy designed to measure when minorities use discrimination as a
   heuristic for understanding society. I use an original online survey of
   non-Whites in the United Kingdom and provide vignettes that describe
   racial inequality in education, employment, politics, the arts, and
   business. I then ask respondents how they would explain each form of
   inequality. This ensures that all minority respondents are reacting to
   the same stimulus. In addition to the new measurement strategy, I make a
   theoretical contribution to the standard analysis of variation across
   minority individuals by emphasizing variation in perceived
   discrimination across institutional fields. This approach has
   implications for debates about racial minorities in the United Kingdom
   and perceived discrimination in general.

AB This study explores whether the diffusion of gender-equitable attitudes

   any positive effect on fertility requires not only high levels of
   gender-equitable attitudes overall, but also attitude convergence
   between men and women. We analyse 27 countries using data from the World
   Values Surveys and European Values Studies. We find support for a
   U-shaped relationship between changes in gender role attitudes and
   fertility: an initial drop in fertility is observed as countries move
   from a traditional to a more gender-symmetric model. Beyond a certain
   threshold, additional increases in gender egalitarianism become
   positively associated with fertility. This curvi-linear relationship is
   moderated by the difference in attitudes between men and women: when
   there is more agreement, changes are more rapid and the effect of gender
   egalitarian attitudes on fertility strengthens.

AB This paper provides an assessment of Pierre Bourdieu's sociology based
   on a reading of his posthumously published lectures on the state in Sur
   l'Etat. It argues that the state was a foundational element in
   Bourdieu's rendition of the symbolic order of everyday life. As such,
   the state becomes equally pivotal in Bourdieu's sociology, the
   applicability of which rests on the existence of the state, which
   stabilizes the social fields and their symbolic action that constitute
   the object of sociology. The state, which Bourdieu considers a
   meta'-ordering principle in social life, ensures that sociology has a
   well-ordered object of study, vis-a-vis which it can posit itself as
   meta-meta'. The state thus functions as an epistemic guarantee in
   Bourdieu's sociology. A critical analysis of Bourdieu's sociology of the
   state offers the chance of a more fundamental overall assessment of
   Bourdieu's conception of sociology that has relevance for any critical
   sociological perspective that rests on the assumption of a meta-social
   entity, such as the state in Bourdieu's work, as a final ordering

   political meanings, knowledge and alternative forms of social
   organization are continually being developed and cultivated. Social
   centres in Barcelona, Spain, autonomous political spaces hosting
   cultural and educational events, protest campaigns and alternative
   living arrangements, are used as empirical case studies. Daily practices
   of food provisioning, distributing space and dividing labour are
   politicized and politicizing as they unfold and develop over time and
   through diverse networks around social centres. Following Melucci, such
   latent processes set the conditions for social movements and
   mobilization to occur. However, they not only underpin mobilization, but
   are themselves politically expressive and prefigurative, with multiple
   layers of latency and visibility identifiable in performances of
   practices. The variety of political forms - adversarial, expressive,
   theoretical, and routinized everyday practices, allow diverse
   identities, materialities and meanings to overlap in movement spaces,
   and help explain networks of mutual support between loosely knit
   networks of activists and non-activists. An approach which focuses on
   practices and networks rather than mobilization and collective actors,
   it is argued, helps show how everyday life and political protest are
   mutually constitutive.

AB Lay perceptions and experiences of social location have been commonly
   framed with reference to social class. However, complex responses to,
   and ambivalence over, class categories have raised interesting analytic
   questions relating to how sociological concepts are operationalized in
   empirical research. For example, prior researchers have argued that
   processes of class dis-identification signify moral unease with the
   nature of classed inequalities, yet dis-identification may also in part
   reflect a poor fit between social class' as a category and the ways in
   which people accord meaning to, and evaluate, their related experiences
   of socio-economic inequality. Differently framed questions about social
   comparison, aligned more closely with people's own terms of reference,
   offer an interesting alternative avenue for exploring subjective
   experiences of inequality. This paper explores some of these questions
   through an analysis of new empirical data, generated in the context of
   recession. In the analysis reported here, class identification was
   common. Nevertheless, whether or not people self identified in class
   terms, class relevant issues were perceived and described in highly
   diverse ways, and lay views on class revealed it to be a very aggregated
   as well as multifaceted construct. It is argued that it enables a
   particular, not general, perspective on social comparison. The paper
   therefore goes on to examine how study participants compared themselves
   with familiar others, identified by themselves. The evidence illuminates
   social positioning in terms of constraint, agency and (for some)
   movement, and offers insight into very diverse experiences of
   inequality, through the comparisons that people made. Their comparisons
   are situated, and pragmatic, accounts of the material contexts in which
   people live their lives. Linked evaluations are circumscribed and
   strongly tied to these proximate material contexts.The paper draws out
   implications for theorizing lay perspectives on class, and subjective
   experiences of inequality.

AB While many aspects of social life possess an emotional component,
   sociology needs to explore explicitly the part emotions play in
   producing the social world and human history. This paper turns away from
   individualistic and anthropocentric emphases upon the experience of
   feelings and emotions, attending instead to an exploration of flows of
   affect' (meaning simply a capacity to affect or be affected) between
   bodies, things, social institutions and abstractions. It establishes a
   materialist sociology of affects that acknowledges emotions as a part,
   but only a part, of a more generalized affective flow that produces
   bodies and the social world. From this perspective, emotions are not a
   peculiarly remarkable outcome of the confluence of biology and culture,
   but part of a continuum of affectivity that links human bodies to their
   physical and social environment. This enhances sociological
   understanding of the part emotions play in shaping actions and
   capacities in many settings of sociological concern.

AB This paper examines how the 2008-9 recession has affected volunteering
   behaviours in the UK. Using a large survey dataset, we assess the
   recession effects on both formal volunteering and informal helping
   behaviours. Whilst both formal volunteering and informal helping have
   been in decline in the UK since 2008, the size of the decline is
   significantly larger for informal helping than for formal volunteering.
   The decline is more salient in regions that experienced a higher level
   of unemployment during the recession and also in socially and
   economically disadvantaged communities. However, we find that a growing
   number of people who personally experienced financial insecurity and
   hardship do not explain the decline. We argue that the decline has more
   to do with community-level factors such as civic organizational
   infrastructure and cultural norms of trust and engagement than personal
   experiences of economic hardship.

AB Sociologists have increasingly come to recognize that the discipline has
   unduly privileged textual representations, but efforts to incorporate
   visual and other media are still only in their beginning. This paper
   develops an analysis of the ways objects of knowledge are translated
   into other media, in order to understand the visual practices of
   sociology and to point out unused possibilities. I argue that the
   discourse on visual sociology, by assuming that photographs are less
   objective than text, is based on an asymmetric media-determinism and on
   a misleading notion of objectivity. Instead, I suggest to analyse media
   with the concept of translations. I introduce several kinds of
   translations, most centrally the distinction between tight and loose
   ones. I show that many sciences, such as biology, focus on tight
   translations, using a variety of media and manipulating both research
   objects and representations. Sociology, in contrast, uses both tight and
   loose translations, but uses the latter only for texts. For visuals,
   sociology restricts itself to what I call the documentary': focusing on
   mechanical recording technologies without manipulating either the object
   of research or the representation. I conclude by discussing three rare
   examples of what is largely excluded in sociology: visual loose
   translations, visual tight translations based on non-mechanical
   recording technologies, and visual tight translations based on
   mechanical recording technologies that include the manipulation of both
   object and representation.

AB In this article I consider the impact of social epistemologies for
   understanding the object of the syringe. My aim is to examine the
   process through which the syringe transforms from an injecting device to
   a tool of social and political inquiry. Paying particular attention to
   the uses of Foucault, Becker, Bourdieu, Freud and Latour in empirical
   studies of injecting heroin use, I examine the sociology of the syringe
   through the lens of habit and habitus, discourse and deviance, mourning
   and melancholia, attachment and agencement. In pursuing the theory
   behind the object my goal is to address a sociological object in the
   making. In so doing I show how the syringe has been significant for
   social research, social theory, and sociology. It is the difference the
   object makes that this article seeks to describe. In tracing the
   epistemology of the syringe I show how the object is important not just
   for knowledge of addiction but sociology itself.

AB Recent years have seen great interest in the relationship between
   relative earnings and marital outcomes. Using data from the 1997
   National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, I examine the effect of relative
   earnings on infidelity, a marital outcome that has received little
   attention. Theories of social exchange predict that the greater one's
   relative income, the more likely one will be to engage in infidelity.
   Yet, emerging literature raises questions about the utility of
   gender-neutral exchange approaches, particularly when men are
   economically dependent and women are breadwinners. I find that, for men,
   breadwinning increases infidelity. For women, breadwinning decreases
   infidelity. I argue that by remaining faithful, breadwinning women
   neutralize their gender deviance and keep potentially strained
   relationships intact. I also find that, for both men and women, economic
   dependency is associated with a higher likelihood of engaging in
   infidelity; but, the influence of dependency on men's infidelity is
   greater than the influence of dependency on women's infidelity. For
   economically dependent persons, infidelity may be an attempt to restore
   relationship equity; however, for men, dependence may be particularly
   threatening. Infidelity may allow economically dependent men to engage
   in compensatory behavior while simultaneously distancing themselves from
   breadwinning spouses.

AB Prominent accounts of the transition to capitalism have a far too
   limited understanding of pre-capitalist agrarian economies' potential
   for dynamism. Recent research shows that conditions earlier accounts
   identify as triggers for a transition to capitalism could be present
   without a transition occurring. I expand on implications of these cases
   of missing transitions for theorizing the dynamics of pre-capitalist
   agrarian economies. I present a theoretical framework that shows how
   phenomena previously associated with the transition to capitalismsuch as
   flexible property rights in land and labor, extensive markets, and
   accumulation of industrial and mercantile wealthemerged in
   pre-capitalist societies without leading to capitalist development. I
   illustrate the analytic upshot of this framework by considering the case
   study of Japan in the Tokugawa era (1603 to 1868). For historical
   sociologists, early modern Japan has long been seen as an anomalous
   case, puzzlingly mixing developments thought to represent early signs of
   capitalism with evidence of the durable survival of the feudal social
   order. In light of a more accurate account of the forces for and limits
   of dynamism in pre-capitalist agrarian economies, Tokugawa-era Japan is
   no longer a puzzling anomaly.

AB This article examines the relationship between income inequality and
   collective labor rights, conceptualized as workers' legal and practical
   ability to engage in collective activity. Although worker organization
   is central to explaining income inequality in industrialized
   democracies, worldwide comparative studies have neglected the role of
   class-based actors. I argue that the repression of labor rights reduces
   the capacity of worker organizations to effectively challenge income
   inequality through market and political processes in capitalist
   societies. Labor rights, however, are unlikely to have uniform effects
   across regions. This study uses unbalanced panel data for 100 developed
   and less developed countries from 1985 through 2002. Random- and
   fixed-effects models find that strong labor rights are tightly linked to
   lower inequality across a large range of countries, including in the
   Global South. Interactions between regions and labor rights suggest that
   the broader context in which class-based actors are embedded shapes
   worker organizations' ability to reduce inequality. During the period of
   this study, labor rights were particularly important for mitigating
   inequality in the West but less so in Eastern Europe.

AB This paper develops a theoretical account of the reconstruction of
   workforce downsizing as a shareholder-value strategy since the 1980s.
   This account has two components. First, building on resource-dependence
   theory, I suggest that growing corporate dependence on institutional
   investors makes firms susceptible to their demand for greater returns,
   especially when these institutional investors are blockholders and
   resistant to counter-pressure from managers. Second, building on
   Fligstein's theory of conceptions of control, I suggest that the rise of
   shareholder value reorients managerial behavior, by changing the
   decision context in a way that induces managers to maximize shareholder
   value. Crucial to constructing this new decision context are a set of
   agency-theory prescriptions for reforming corporate governance. My
   analysis of downsizing announcements, drawing on a sample of 714 US
   firms between 1981 and 2006, shows that both the pressure from
   institutional investors and the new decision context encourage firms to
   downsize more frequently. By demonstrating how both pressure from
   investors and changed managerial decision contexts have contributed to
   the prevalence of workforce downsizing, this paper makes a strong case
   for the financialization of the American corporation, and contributes to
   the sociological research on growing job insecurity and income
   inequality over the past three decades.

   first identify latent trajectories of work and family roles between late
   adolescence and age 65. We then model economic well-being at age 65 as a
   function of these trajectories and contemporaneously measured indicators
   of older adults' work, family, and health statuses. Our central finding
   is that trajectories of work and family experiences across the life
   course have direct effects on later-life economic well-being, as well as
   indirect effects that operate through more proximate measures of work,
   family, and other characteristics. We argue that these findings have
   important implications for how social scientists conceptualize and model

AB During the US Industrial Revolution, educational expansion may have
   created skilled jobs through innovation and skill upgrading or reduced
   skilled jobs by mechanizing production. Such arguments contradict
   classic sociological work that treats education as a sorting mechanism,
   allocating individuals to fixed occupations. I capitalize on state
   differences in the timing of compulsory school attendance laws to ask
   whether raising the minimum level of schooling: (1) increased school
   attendance rate; or (2) shifted state occupational distributions away
   from agricultural toward skilled and non-manual occupation categories.
   Using state-level panel data constructed from 1850-1930 censuses and
   state-year fixed effects models, I find that compulsory laws
   significantly increased school attendance rates, particularly among
   lower-class children, and shifted the categorical distribution toward
   skilled and non-manual occupations. Thus, rather than deskilling through
   mechanization, raising the minimum level of education seems to have
   created skilled jobs and raised the occupational distribution through
   skill-biased technological change. Results suggest that education was
   not merely a sorting mechanism, supporting the importance of education
   as an institution even around the turn of the century.

AB A drawback to research on interracial couplings is that it almost
   exclusively studies heterosexual relationships. However, compelling new
   evidence from analyses using the Census shows that interracial
   relationships are significantly more common among the gay population. It
   is unclear how much of this reflects weaker racial preference or more
   limited dating markets. This paper examines the interactions of white
   gay and straight online daters who have access to a large market of
   potential partners by modeling dyadic messaging behaviors. Results show
   that racial preferences are highly gendered, and do not line up neatly
   by gay or straight identity. White lesbians and straight men show the
   weakest same-race preference, followed by gay men, while straight women
   show the strongest same-race preference. Put differently, minority men
   are discriminated to a greater degree than minority women in both
   same-sex and different-sex dating markets. These results suggest that
   white gay men's higher rates of interracial cohabitation are driven more
   by constrained dating markets, while lesbians' appear to be driven by
   more open racial preferences.

AB Racial inequality in economic outcomes, particularly among the college
   educated, persists throughout US society. Scholars debate whether this
   inequality stems from racial differences in human capital (e.g., college
   selectivity, GPA, college major) or employer discrimination against
   black job candidates. However, limited measures of human capital and the
   inherent difficulties in measuring discrimination using observational
   data make determining the cause of racial differences in labor-market
   outcomes a difficult endeavor. In this research, I examine employment
   opportunities for white and black graduates of elite top-ranked
   universities versus high-ranked but less selective institutions. Using
   an audit design, I create matched candidate pairs and apply for 1,008
   jobs on a national job-search website. I also exploit existing
   birth-record data in selecting names to control for differences across
   social class within racialized names. The results show that although a
   credential from an elite university results in more employer responses
   for all candidates, black candidates from elite universities only do as
   well as white candidates from less selective universities. Moreover,
   race results in a double penalty: When employers respond to black
   candidates, it is for jobs with lower starting salaries and lower
   prestige than those of white peers. These racial differences suggest

AB This paper examines the types of neighborhoods that black and white
   homebuyers have secured loans in during the recent housing boom and
   subsequent bust. We expand upon and refine previous research on
   locational attainment using loan-level data from the 1992-2010 Home
   Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) combined with tract- and
   metropolitan-level data from the 1990, 2000, and 2010 Census and the
   American Community Survey. Multilevel models show that black homebuyers
   are moving into considerably more racially segregated neighborhoods than
   their white counterparts and that their access to "whiter" neighborhoods
   did not expand during the housing boom, even after controlling for the
   racial composition of the metropolitan area and other key ecological
   factors. Conversely, new white homebuyers have been moving into
   neighborhoods with greater percent black residents, which may be a
   contributing factor in observed declines in segregation during the past
   few decades. Additionally, black homebuyers in metropolitan areas with
   greater suburban growth were on average accessing homes in more
   integrated neighborhoods. Finally, the models explained considerably
   more of the variation in the neighborhood racial composition of whites
   compared to blacks. These findings are suggestive of a dual housing
   market, one in which the experiences of blacks are still systematically
   different than those of whites, despite expanded access to
   homeownership.

AB In recent decades, the expansion of women's political representation in
   sub-Saharan Africa has been nothing short of remarkable. The number of
   women legislators in African parliaments tripled between 1990 and 2010,
   resulting in African countries having among the highest rates of women's
   legislative representation in the world. The dominant explanations for
   this change have been institutional factors (namely, the adoption of
   gender quotas and presence of proportional representation systems) and
   democratization. We suggest that existing research has not gone far
   enough to evaluate the effects of one powerful structural change: the
   end of civil war. Using Latent Growth Curve modeling, we show that the
   end of long-standing armed conflict had large positive impacts on
   women's political representation, above what can be explained by
   electoral institutions and democratization alone. However, post-conflict
   increases in women's legislative representation materialize only after
   2000, amid emerging international and regional norms of women's
   political inclusion. In countries exiting armed conflict in these recent
   years, women's movement into national legislatures follows a trajectory
   of social change that is much faster and more extensive than what we
   observe in other African countries.

AB Since the 1970s, expressions of state concern over low fertility have
   greatly increased among wealthier countries. This study asks to what
   extent this increase is explained by demographic factors, national-level
   economic and political factors, and processes of international diffusion
   and changing international norms. Analyses integrate the world polity
   literature on global policy diffusion with a social problems approach to
   examine international diffusion of state concern among more powerful
   members of the world polity, a process that can produce changes in
   international policy consensus. Comparisons of the characteristics of
   states that do and do not express concern over low fertility find that
   among wealthier "first-world" countries, state concern has become more
   responsive to fertility rates: fertility rates are not significantly
   associated with concern early in the study period, but are strongly
   associated with concern later in the study period. There is no evidence
   that integration into the world polity is associated with concern in
   these countries, and some evidence that less integrated countries are
   more likely to express concern, suggesting that processes shaping the
   diffusion of state concern may differ from those identified as shaping
   policy diffusion in the existing literature. Among "second-world" former
   Eastern bloc countries, different patterns of associations reflect
   different political histories: concern is associated only with
   demographic factors, with no significant change in this association over
   time.

AB Female life expectancy is currently shorter in the United States than in
   most high-income countries. This study examines work-family context as a
   potential explanation. While work-family context changed similarly
   across high-income countries during the past half century, the United
   States has not implemented institutional supports, such as universally
   available childcare and family leave, to help Americans contend with
   these changes. We compare the United States to Finland-a country with
   similar trends in work-family life but generous institutional
   supports-and test two hypotheses to explain US women's longevity
   disadvantage: (1) US women may be less likely than Finnish women to
   combine employment with childrearing; and (2) US women's longevity may
   benefit less than Finnish women's longevity from combining employment
   with childrearing. We used data from women aged 30-60aEuro...years
   during 1988-2006 in the US National Health Interview Survey Linked
   Mortality File and harmonized it with data from Finnish national
   registers. We found stronger support for hypothesis 1, especially among
   low-educated women. Contrary to hypothesis 2, combining employment and
   childrearing was not less beneficial for US women's longevity. In a
   simulation exercise, more than 75 percent of US women's longevity
   disadvantage was eliminated by raising their employment levels to
   Finnish levels and reducing mortality rates of non-married/non-employed
   US women to Finnish rates.

AB Although the negative association between unemployment and life
   satisfaction is well documented, much theoretical and empirical
   controversy surrounds the question of how unemployment actually shapes
   life satisfaction. Previous studies suggest that unemployment may
   endanger subjective well-being through individual experiences,
   contextual influences, or a combination of both. Drawing on data from
   the World and European Values Surveys, National Accounts Official
   Country Data, Social Security Programs Throughout the World Reports,
   World Development Indicators, and World Income Inequality databases for
   398,533 individuals in 95 nations (1981-2009), we use three-level
   hierarchical linear models to test four competing theory-based
   hypotheses-that unemployment shapes life satisfaction through
   individual, contextual, additive, or multiplicative effects. Our results
   support a multiplicative interaction between individual- and
   country-level unemployment. Unemployed individuals are less satisfied
   than other individuals, and when unemployment rates rise, their
   satisfaction drops even further below students, homemakers, and employed
   individuals; retirees, however, become more similar to the unemployed.
   We discuss these findings in light of previous theoretical models to
   argue for a model where individual unemployment is understood in the
   context of diverse labor force statuses and national unemployment rates.
   We conclude with policy suggestions aiming to address the negative
   consequences of unemployment through individualized and contextualized
   plans.

AB Previous research on attitudes toward immigrants has so far focused on
   composite outcome measures instead of dealing with more specific forms
   of perceived threat and prejudice. The present article approaches this
   gap by investigating the antecedents of the perception that immigrants
   take jobs away from the host-country population. This form of perceived
   economic competition is a fundamental feature of immigrant-native
   relations in many countries, and it is embedded in the institution of
   the labor market. Accordingly, the main interest of this study lies in
   the influence of two central aspects of labor market policy, employment
   protection legislation and unemployment benefit level. European Social
   Survey data are used in multilevel models that include individual-,
   regional-, and country-level factors. The results indicate that
   unemployment benefits abate perceived competition, and the impact is
   strong. This finding is robust against the inclusion of several other
   policy indicators, including integration policies, welfare regime types,
   and other structural factors such as unemployment rates and unionization
   figures. Employment protection affects perceived economic threat only
   indirectly by mitigating the impact of regional unemployment.
   Furthermore, it actually increases perceived competition for unemployed
   persons. These findings challenge the notion that prevention is always
   better than cure.

AB How has the recent shift toward multidisciplinary research affected
   intellectual cohesion in academia? We answer this question through an
   examination of collaborations and knowledge flows among researchers. We
   examine the relevant case of Stanford University during a period of
   intense investment in multidisciplinary research, using a novel measure
   of knowledge flows in the short-cycled movement of published references
   from one researcher to another. We describe intellectual cohesion and
   its trajectory among 1,007 faculty members between 1997 and 2006, and
   then examine the social-structural antecedents of dyadic knowledge flows
   that help explain macro-level patterns. Results show that university
   collaborations have grown denser and more integrated across faculty
   members and their institutional divisions. However, this integration is
   led by "star" researchers and is accompanied by a greater centralization
   of knowledge flows around these individuals. Results illustrate
   important shifts in the nature of academic research, and contribute to a
   dynamic view of intellectual cohesion.

AB Existing research shows that women's employment patterns are not driven
   so much by gender as by motherhood, with childless people and fathers
   employed at substantially higher levels than mothers in most countries.
   We focus on the cross-national variation in the gap in employment
   participation and working hours between mothers and childless women.
   Controlling for individual- and household-level factors, we provide
   evidence that institutional and cultural contexts shape maternal
   employment. Well-paid leaves, publicly supported childcare services for
   very young children, and cultural support for maternal employment
   predict smaller differences in employment participation and working
   hours between mothers and childless women. Yet, extended leave, notably
   when unpaid, is associated with larger motherhood employment gaps.

AB In this article, we use data on virtually all foreclosure events between
   2005 and 2009 to calculate neighborhood foreclosure rates for nearly all
   block groups in the United States to assess the impact of housing
   foreclosures on neighborhood racial/ethnic change and on broader
   patterns of racial residential segregation. We find that the foreclosure
   crisis was patterned strongly along racial lines: black, Latino, and
   racially integrated neighborhoods had exceptionally high foreclosure
   rates. Multilevel models of racial/ethnic change reveal that foreclosure
   concentrations were linked to declining shares of whites and expanding
   shares of black and Latino residents. Results further suggest that these
   compositional shifts were driven by both white population loss and
   minority growth, especially from racially mixed settings with high
   foreclosure rates. To explore the impact of these racially selective
   migration streams on patterns of residential segregation, we simulate
   racial segregation assuming that foreclosure rates remained at their
   2005 levels throughout the crisis period. Our simulations suggest that
   the foreclosure crisis increased racial segregation between blacks and
   whites by 1.1 dissimilarity points, and between Latinos and whites by
   2.2 dissimilarity points.

AB We argue that residential exposure to ethnic diversity reduces social
   trust. Previous within-country analyses of the relationship between
   contextual ethnic diversity and trust have been conducted at higher
   levels of aggregation, thus ignoring substantial variation in actual
   exposure to ethnic diversity. In contrast, we analyze how ethnic
   diversity of the immediate micro-contextwhere interethnic exposure is
   inevitableaffects trust. We do this using Danish survey data linked with
   register-based data, which enables us to obtain precise measures of the
   ethnic diversity of each individual's residential surroundings. We focus
   on contextual diversity within a radius of 80 meters of a given
   individual, but we also compare the effect in the micro-context to the
   impact of diversity in more aggregate contexts. Our results show that
   ethnic diversity in the micro-context affects trust negatively, whereas
   the effect vanishes in larger contextual units. This supports the
   conjecture that interethnic exposure underlies the negative relationship
   between ethnic diversity in residential contexts and social trust.

AB This project explores whether and how corporations become more receptive
   to social activist challenges over time. Drawing from social movement
   theory, we suggest a dynamic process through which contentious
   interactions lead to increased receptivity. We argue that when firms are
   chronically targeted by social activists, they respond defensively by
   adopting strategic management devices that help them better manage
   social issues and demonstrate their normative appropriateness. These
   defensive devices have the incidental effect of empowering independent
   monitors and increasing corporate accountability, which in turn increase
   a firm's receptivity to future activist challenges. We test our theory
   using a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks contentious attacks and
   the adoption of social management devices among a population of 300
   large firms from 1993 to 2009.

AB A major policy issue in standard setting is that patents that are ex
   ante not that important, by being included into a standard, may become
   standard-essential patents. In an attempt to curb the monopoly power
   that they create, most standard-setting organizations require the owners
   of patents covered by the standard to make a loose commitment to grant
   licenses on reasonable terms. Such commitments unsurprisingly are
   conducive to litigation. This paper builds a framework for the analysis
   of these patents, identifies several types of inefficiencies attached to
   the lack of price commitments, and shows how structured price
   commitments restore competition and why such commitments may not arise
   spontaneously in the marketplace.

   We use recursive preferences in order to separate heterogeneity in risk
   aversion from heterogeneity in the intertemporal elasticity of
   substitution and an overlapping-generations framework to obtain a
   nondegenerate stationary equilibrium. We solve the model explicitly up
   to the solutions of ordinary differential equations and highlight the
   effects of overlapping generations and each dimension of preference
   heterogeneity on the market price of risk, interest rates, and the
   volatility of stock returns. We find that separating intertemporal

AB Credit cycles have been a characteristic of advanced economies for over
   100years. On average, a sustained pick-up in the ratio of credit to GDP
   has been highly correlated with banking crises. The boom phases of the
   cycle are characterised by large deviations in credit from trend. A
   range of mechanisms can generate these effects, each of which has
   strategic complementarity between banks at its core. Macro-prudential
   policy could curb these credit cycles, both through raising the cost of
   maintaining risky portfolios and through an expectations channel that
   operates via banks' perceptions of other banks' actions.

AB Rent-based accounts of inequality argue that institutionalized barriers
   to the access to labour market positions create artificial restrictions
   on the supply of labour and, in turn, generate wages for workers in
   protected positions in excess of the wages they would receive in a
   competitive labour market. In this article, we extend this argument to
   the comparative context, and elaborate a rent-based explanation of
   between-occupation wage inequality in Germany and the United Kingdom. We
   test it with new and unique data on four institutionalized sources of
   closure (educational credentialing, licensure, unionization, and
   apprenticeships), matched to newly constructed measures of occupational
   skills and to national labour force survey data. We show that in both
   countries, between-occupation wage inequality is substantial, and much
   of it can be traced to variations across occupations in closure and to
   the positive association between closure and wages. We also show that
   the prevalence and the payoff to each of the four closure institutions
   differ across the two countries: Specifically, vocational credentialing
   and unionization have a particularly high payoff in Germany, while
   tertiary credentialing and licensure have a particularly high payoff in
   the United Kingdom. These results have important implications for
   understanding between-occupation wage inequality and cross-national
   differences in aggregate levels of wage inequality.

   primarily improves health through two metamechanisms: better access to

   metamechanism: an efficiency-equity trade-off. A case in point is kidney
   transplantation, where the mechanisms previously thought to link race to
   outcomesability to pay and certain factors in the kidney allocation
   systemhave been greatly reduced, yet large disparities persist. I show
   that these current disparities are rooted in factors that directly

AB This study rehabilitates concepts from classical human ecology and
   synthesizes them with contemporary urban and environmental sociology to
   advance a theory of urbanization as socioenvironmental succession. The
   theory illuminates how social and biophysical phenomena interact
   endogenously at the local level to situate urban land use patterns
   recursively and reciprocally in place. To demonstrate this theory we
   conduct a historical-comparative analysis of hazardous industrial site
   accumulation in four U.S. cities, using a relational database that was
   assembled for more than 11,000 facilities that operated during the past
   half centurymost of which remain unacknowledged in government reports.
   Results show how three iterative processeshazardous industrial churning,
   residential churning, and risk containmentintersect to produce
   successive socioenvironmental changes that are highly relevant to but
   often missed by research on urban growth machines, environmental
   inequality, and systemic risk.

AB Center-periphery explanations focus on political centralization, state
   collapse, and nationalization to explain the genesis of separatist
   movements that form new national states. This study shows that three
   periods of Chinese-Mongolian relationsland reform (1900-1911),
   revolution and interregnum (1912-16) and warlordism (1917-30)contained
   events that center-periphery perspectives associate with the rise of
   autonomous movements, yet Mongolian separatism did not occur until the
   last period. To explain this puzzle, the author characterizes the
   formation, integration, and dismemberment of the frontier governance
   system as an intermediate body between the center and the periphery. She
   demonstrates that the effects pointed to by center-periphery
   explanations were mediated, at least in the case of Inner Mongolia, by
   the structural transformations of the frontier governance system. Not
   assuming a natural opposition between the center and the periphery, this
   study elucidates the polarization of the center-periphery relationship
   and its impact on minority separatism.

AB Organizing collective action to secure support from local communities
   provides a source of power for elites to protect their interests, but
   community structures constrain the ability of elites to use this power.
   Elites' power is not static or self-perpetuating but changing and
   dynamic. There are situations in which elites are forced into
   movement-like struggles to mobilize support from their community. The
   success of elites' mobilization is affected by cultural and structural
   factors that shape the collective meaning of supporting elites' actions
   and the identities that are formed in doing so. I find broad support for
   these propositions in a study of the issuances of small-denomination
   currency substitutes in 145 U.S. cities during the Panic of 1907. I
   discuss the contributions of this article to elite studies, the social
   movement literature, and the sociology of money.

AB Do female managers act in ways that narrow or instead act in ways that
   preserve or even widen the gender wage gap? Although conceptual
   arguments exist on both sides of this debate, the empirical evidence to
   date has favored the former view. Yet this evidence comes primarily from
   cross-establishment surveys, which do not provide visibility into
   individual managers' choices. Using longitudinal personnel records from
   an information services firm in which managers had considerable
   discretion over employee salaries, we estimate multilevel models that
   indicate no support for the proposition that female managers reduce the
   gender wage gap among their subordinates. Consistent with the theory of
   value threat, we instead find conditional support for the
   cogs-in-the-machine perspective: in the subsample of high-performing
   supervisors and low-performing employees, women who switched from a male
   to a female supervisor had a lower salary in the following year than men
   who made the same switch.

AB Data on age-sequenced trajectories of individuals' attributes are used
   for a growing number of research purposes. However, there is no
   consensus about which method to use to identify the number of discrete
   trajectories in a population or to assign individuals to a specific
   trajectory group. The authors modeled real and simulated trajectory data
   using naive methods, optimal matching, grade of membership models, and
   three types of finite-mixture models. They found that these methods
   produced inferences about the number of trajectories that frequently
   differ (1) from one another and (2) from the truth as represented by
   simulation parameters. They also found that they differed in the
   assignment of individuals to trajectory groups. In light of these
   findings, the authors argue that researchers should interpret results
   based on these methods cautiously, neither reifying point estimates
   about the number of trajectories nor treating individuals' trajectory
   group assignments as certain.

AB We study markets in which agents first make investments and are then
   matched into potentially productive partnerships. Equilibrium
   investments and the equilibrium matching will be efficient if agents can
   simultaneously negotiate investments and matches, but we focus on
   markets in which agents must first sink their investments before
   matching. Additional equilibria may arise in this sunk-investment
   setting, even though our matching market is competitive. These
   equilibria exhibit inefficiencies that we can interpret as coordination
   failures. All allocations satisfying a constrained efficiency property
   are equilibria, and the converse holds if preferences satisfy a
   separability condition. We identify sufficient conditions (most notably,
   quasiconcave utilities) for the investments of matched agents to satisfy
   an exchange efficiency property as well as sufficient conditions (most
   notably, a single crossing property) for agents to be matched positive
   assortatively, with these conditions then forming the core of sufficient
   conditions for the efficiency of equilibrium allocations.

AB Harsanyi (1974) criticized the von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) stable set
   for its presumption that coalitions are myopic about their prospects. He
   proposed a new dominance relation incorporating farsightedness, but
   retained another feature of the stable set: that a coalition S can
   impose any imputation as long as its restriction to S is feasible for
   it. This implicitly gives an objecting coalition complete power to
   arrange the payoffs of players elsewhere, which is clearly
   unsatisfactory. While this assumption is largely innocuous for myopic
   dominance, it is of crucial significance for its farsighted counterpart.
   Our modification of the Harsanyi set respects coalitional sovereignty.
   The resulting farsighted stable set is very different from both the
   Harsanyi and the vNM sets. We provide a necessary and sufficient
   condition for the existence of a farsighted stable set containing just a
   single-payoff allocation. This condition roughly establishes an
   equivalence between core allocations and the union of allocations over
   all single-payoff farsighted stable sets. We then conduct a
   comprehensive analysis of the existence and structure of farsighted
   stable sets in simple games. This last exercise throws light on both
   single-payoff and multi-payoff stable sets, and suggests that they do
   not coexist.

AB We develop a new parametric estimation procedure for option panels
   observed with error. We exploit asymptotic approximations assuming an
   ever increasing set of option prices in the moneyness (cross-sectional)
   dimension, but with a fixed time span. We develop consistent estimators
   for the parameters and the dynamic realization of the state vector
   governing the option price dynamics. The estimators converge stably to a
   mixed-Gaussian law and we develop feasible estimators for the limiting
   variance. We also provide semiparametric tests for the option price
   dynamics based on the distance between the spot volatility extracted
   from the options and one constructed nonparametrically from
   high-frequency data on the underlying asset. Furthermore, we develop new
   tests for the day-by-day model fit over specific regions of the
   volatility surface and for the stability of the risk-neutral dynamics
   over time. A comprehensive Monte Carlo study indicates that the
   inference procedures work well in empirically realistic settings. In an
   empirical application to S&P 500 index options, guided by the new
   diagnostic tests, we extend existing asset pricing models by allowing
   for a flexible dynamic relation between volatility and priced jump tail
   risk. Importantly, we document that the priced jump tail risk typically
   responds in a more pronounced and persistent manner than volatility to
   large negative market shocks.

AB This paper studies two-sided matching markets with non-transferable
   utility when the number of market participants grows large. We consider
   a model in which each agent has a random preference ordering over
   individual potential matching partners, and agents' types are only
   partially observed by the econometrician. We show that in a large
   market, the inclusive value is a sufficient statistic for an agent's
   endogenous choice set with respect to the probability of being matched
   to a spouse of a given observable type. Furthermore, while the number of
   pairwise stable matchings for a typical realization of random utilities
   grows at a fast rate as the number of market participants increases, the
   inclusive values resulting from any stable matching converge to a unique
   deterministic limit. We can therefore characterize the limiting
   distribution of the matching market as the unique solution to a
   fixed-point condition on the inclusive values. Finally we analyze
   identification and estimation of payoff parameters from the asymptotic
   distribution of observable characteristics at the level of pairs
   resulting from a stable matching.

AB When people interact in familiar settings, social conventions usually
   develop so that people tend to disregard alternatives outside the
   convention. For rational players to usually restrict attention to a
   block of conventional strategies, no player should prefer to deviate
   from the block when others are likely to act conventionally and
   rationally inside the block. We explore two set-valued concepts,
   coarsely and finely tenable blocks, that formalize this notion for
   finite normal-form games. We then identify settled equilibria, which are
   Nash equilibria with support in minimal tenable blocks. For a generic
   class of normal-form games, our coarse and fine concepts are equivalent,
   and yet they differ from standard solution concepts on open sets of
   games. We demonstrate the nature and power of the solutions by way of
   examples. Settled equilibria are closely related to persistent
   equilibria but are strictly more selective on an open set of games. With
   fine tenability, we obtain invariance under the insertion of a subgame
   with a unique totally mixed payoff-equivalent equilibrium, a property
   that other related concepts have not satisfied.

   conditional moment restrictions with possibly nonsmooth generalized
   residuals, which include all of the (nonlinear) nonparametric
   instrumental variables (IV) as special cases. These models are often
   ill-posed and hence it is difficult to verify whether a (possibly
   nonlinear) functional is root-n estimable or not. We provide
   computationally simple, unified inference procedures that are
   asymptotically valid regardless of whether a functional is root-n
   estimable or not. We establish the following new useful results: (1) the
   asymptotic normality of a plug-in penalized sieve minimum distance
   (PSMD) estimator of a (possibly nonlinear) functional; (2) the
   consistency of simple sieve variance estimators for the plug-in PSMD
   estimator, and hence the asymptotic chi-square distribution of the sieve
   Wald statistic; (3) the asymptotic chi-square distribution of an
   optimally weighted sieve quasi likelihood ratio (QLR) test under the
   null hypothesis; (4) the asymptotic tight distribution of a
   non-optimally weighted sieve QLR statistic under the null; (5) the
   consistency of generalized residual bootstrap sieve Wald and QLR tests;
   (6) local power properties of sieve Wald and QLR tests and of their
   bootstrap versions; (7) asymptotic properties of sieve Wald and SQLR for
   functionals of increasing dimension. Simulation studies and an empirical
   illustration of a nonparametric quantile IV regression are presented.

   outcome and first stage equations are strictly increasing in a scalar
   unobservable, then many kinds of continuous, discrete, and even binary
   instruments can be used to point-identify the levels of the outcome
   equation. This contrasts sharply with related work by Imbens and Newey,
   2009 that requires continuous instruments with large support. One
   implication is that assumptions about the dimension of heterogeneity can
   provide nonparametric point-identification of the distribution of
   treatment response for a continuous treatment in a randomized controlled

AB Social science accounts have only recently begun to recognize "new
   governance" shifts, including, but not limited to, privatization
   occurring in public sector institutions (e.g., education, prisons, the
   military) and in the functioning of federal and state sector jobs. This
   article, which presents unique analyses of wages across time using the
   Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and retested on similarly
   representative data from the Integrated Public Use Micro Sample (IPUMS)
   and the American Community Survey (ACS), examines the extent to which
   these changes have generated significant inequalities for African
   Americans relative to whites. Most important, our results show that the
   relative racial parity in wages that once existed in public sector
   employment has eroded in the face of new governance, and racial
   inequalities for both men and women have intensified. Supplementary and
   decomposition analyses further highlight the potential escalation of
   discrimination as a core mechanism under new governance. Along with
   discussing the short- and long-term implications, we conclude by
   suggesting an important corrective to stratification scholarship-a
   corrective that highlights what structural transformation may mean for
   inequality and that recognizes important shifts that have made the
   public sector, much like the private sector, a locus of contemporary
   racial disadvantage.

AB In this article, we describe how residential segregation and individual
   racial disparities generate racialized patterns of subprime lending and
   lead to financial loss among black borrowers in segregated cities. We
   conceptualize race as a cumulative disadvantage because of its direct
   and indirect effects on socioeconomic status at the individual and
   neighborhood levels, with consequences that reverberate across a
   borrower's life and between generations. Using Baltimore, Maryland as a
   case study setting, we combine data from reports filed under the Home
   Mortgage Disclosure Act with additional loan-level data from
   mortgage-backed securities. We find that race and neighborhood racial
   segregation are critical factors explaining black disadvantage across
   successive stages in the process of lending and foreclosure, controlling
   for differences in borrower credit scores, income, occupancy status, and
   loan-to-value ratios. We analyze the cumulative cost of predatory
   lending to black borrowers in terms of reduced disposable income and
   lost wealth. We find the cost to be substantial. Black borrowers paid an
   estimated additional 5 to 11 percent in monthly payments and those that
   completed foreclosure in the sample lost an excess of $2 million in home
   equity. These costs were magnified in mostly black neighborhoods and in
   turn heavily concentrated in communities of color. By elucidating the
   mechanisms that link black segregation to discrimination we demonstrate
   how processes of cumulative disadvantage continue to undermine black
   socioeconomic status in the United States today.

AB Arab Americans have borne the greatest brunt of government and non-state
   repression in the aftermath of the terrorists' attacks on September 11,
   2001. In this study, we document how post-9/11 repression affects Arab
   American protest at the macro and micro level. Coding articles from the
   Detroit Free Press (1999-2010), we find at the macro level that Arab
   American protest in the Detroit area spiked in the aftermath of 9/11 and
   that there is a strong temporal relationship between anti-Arab/Muslim
   hate crime and protest. At the micro level, results from the Detroit
   Arab American Study (2003) show that personally experiencing repression
   enhances protest participation most strongly for those whose Arab
   identity is not especially salient. We interpret this finding to mean
   that such individuals experience repression as a moral shock and/or

   to protest. This is one of the first studies to demonstrate that
   repression can be especially mobilizing for those who under other
   circumstances would be least likely to protest. Our study pushes
   theorizing about repression by highlighting that the state is not the
   only actor who represses; that repression need not target protestors to
   affect the possibilities of protest; and that state and non-state

AB This study examines social class and race differences in young women's
   social capital for the development of educational and occupational
   plans. Using in-depth interviews with 59 middle- and working-class black
   and white high school girls, findings show that inequality in adolescent
   social capital occurs by social class and, within class, by race, in
   access to high-status adult ties, and in the successful mobilization of
   those ties to procure resources. In turn, inequality in social capital
   contributes to disparities in young women's future plans. This study
   advances prior work by elucidating differences in social capital at a
   critical period of the life course; by considering the full range of
   adults upon which young people may rely in the transition to adulthood;
   and by showing how these processes contribute to class and race
   disparities in adolescent future plans. Three forms of adolescent social
   capital, which vary by social class and race, are identified: sponsored
   social capital, insulated social capital, and restricted social capital.

AB Legitimacy is widely recognized as necessary for the resilience and
   success of revolutionary groups, yet successful revolutionary groups are
   frequently viewed as illegitimate during the course of conflicts. I
   examine this paradox through the case of the Kurdistan Workers' Party
   (PKK) in Turkey. Combining historical research with analysis of the
   discourse used by the group to frame their goals and to cultivate
   expectations among constituents, I detail how the PICK took advantage of
   the benefits of legitimacy from various audiences over time until the
   associated expectations became unwanted constraints. I show how multiple
   shifting sources of legitimacy allowed the PICK to be perceived as
   illegitimate by various audiences without compromising their capacity
   for resilience and success as they retained support within a broadly
   legitimated movement for Kurdish rights in Turkey. This research offers
   broad new insights into the cumulative effects of multiple sources of
   legitimacy, the relationality of legitimacy, and the benefits of
   illegitimacy.

   this article explores the macro-level determinants of the gender-poverty
   gap in the ten post-socialist EU member states. In dialogue with the
   literature on the impact of economic development on gender inequality in
   Asia and Latin America, we find that fast-paced, foreign capital-led
   economic growth is associated with a larger gender-poverty gap in
   Central and Eastern Europe, while generous welfare policies,
   specifically higher levels of spending on pensions and family policies,
   are correlated with women's lower relative destitution. These findings
   evaluate the impact of neoliberal style "economic development" on gender
   inequality in a geopolitically specific context and suggest that
   structural adjustment and global market integration may exacerbate
   women's vulnerability even when they are well equipped with human
   capital and other resources to compete with men in the labor market.

   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) registered with the IRS ballooned
   from about 1,000 in 1990 to over 11,000 in 2010, and most of these are
   small organizations run on a voluntary basis. These NGOs are
   headquartered in one-third of all U.S. counties, representing every
   state in the United States. How can we explain the distribution and the
   growth of these organizations over time? I use a multilevel model with
   county means to show that higher per-county income, education, percent
   of residents born abroad, and higher numbers of religious congregations
   and Rotary Clubs explain between-county differences, although only
   education and number of congregations retain positive within-county,
   over-time effects. The article aims to inject a globalized perspective
   into theories of nonprofits and voluntarism and to demonstrate that the
   decentralization of aid to voluntary actors is a phenomenon that must be
   taken up by scholars of globalization and development.

AB Over 130,000 juveniles are detained in the United States each year with
   70,000 in detention on any given day, yet little is known about whether
   such a penalty deters future crime or interrupts social and human
   capital formation in a way that increases the likelihood of later
   criminal behavior. This article uses the incarceration tendency of
   randomly assigned judges as an instrumental variable to estimate causal
   effects of juvenile incarceration on high school completion and adult
   recidivism. Estimates based on over 35,000 juvenile offenders over a
   10-year period from a large urban county in the United States suggest
   that juvenile incarceration results in substantially lower high school
   completion rates and higher adult incarceration rates, including for
   violent crimes. In an attempt to understand the large effects, we found
   that incarceration for this population could be very disruptive, greatly
   reducing the likelihood of ever returning to school and, for those who
   do return, significantly increasing the likelihood of being classified
   as having an emotional or behavioral disorder.

   likely to accept offers, even though referrals and nonreferrals have
   similar skill characteristics. Referred workers tend to have similar
   productivity compared to nonreferred workers on most measures, but
   referred workers have lower accident rates in trucking and produce more
   patents in high-tech. Referred workers are substantially less likely to
   quit and earn slightly higher wages than nonreferred workers. In call
   centers and trucking, the two industries for which we can calculate
   worker-level profits, referred workers yield substantially higher
   profits per worker than nonreferred workers. These profit differences
   are driven by lower turnover and lower recruiting costs for referrals.

AB We study the demand response to nonlinear price schedules using data on
   insurance contracts and prescription drug purchases in Medicare Part D.
   We exploit the kink in individuals' budgets set created by the famous
   "donut hole," where insurance becomes discontinuously much less generous
   on the margin, to provide descriptive evidence of the drug purchase
   response to a price increase. We then specify and estimate a simple
   dynamic model of drug use that allows us to quantify the spending
   response along the entire nonlinear budget set. We use the model for
   counterfactual analysis of the increase in spending from "filling" the
   donut hole, as will be required by 2020 under the Affordable Care Act.
   In our baseline model, which considers spending decisions within a
   single year, we estimate that filling the donut hole will increase
   annual drug spending by about $150, or about 8 percent. About
   one-quarter of this spending increase reflects anticipatory behavior,
   coming from beneficiaries whose spending prior to the policy change
   would leave them short of reaching the donut hole. We also present
   descriptive evidence of cross-year substitution of spending by
   individuals who reach the kink, which motivates a simple extension to
   our baseline model that allows-in a highly stylized way-for individuals
   to engage in such cross-year substitution. Our estimates from this
   extension suggest that a large share of the $150 drug spending increase
   could be attributed to cross-year substitution, and the net increase
   could be as little as $45 a year.

   We define an exclusive and exhaustive partition of the universe of
   theoretically possible n-party systems into five basic classes, the
   understanding of which facilitates more fruitful modeling of legislative
   politics, including government formation. Having defined a partition of
   legislative party systems and elaborated logical implications of this
   partition, we classify the population of postwar European legislatures.
   We show empirically that many of these are close to critical boundary
   conditions, so that stochastic processes involved in any legislative
   election could easily flip the resulting legislature from one type to
   another. This is of more than hypothetical interest, since we also show
   that important political outcomes differ systematically between the

   formation negotiations, type of coalition cabinet that forms, and
   stability of the resulting government.

AB Modern American political campaigns are typically conceptualized as
   candidate-centered and treated as conditionally independent in
   quantitative analyses. In reality, however, these campaigns are linked
   by professional consulting firms, which are important agents of campaign
   strategy diffusion within the extended party networks of the
   contemporary era. To test our hypothesis that consultants disseminate
   campaign strategies among their clients, we analyze new data on U.S.
   House elections derived from Federal Election Commission records. Using
   spatial autoregressive models, we find that candidates who share
   consultants are more likely to use similar campaign strategies than we
   would otherwise expect, conditional on numerous explanatory variables.
   These results, which largely withstand an extensive series of robustness
   and falsification tests, suggest that consultants play a key role in
   diffusing strategies among congressional campaigns.

   nonpoor voters. Using an original data set on unlicensed street vending
   and enforcement operations at the subcity district level in three Latin
   American capital cities, I show that the combination of voter

   Specifically, we test the effects of changes in individuals' ideological
   congruence with the Court and exposure to the nonlegalistic account of
   the decision. We find that both affect perceptions of the Court's
   legitimacy. Moreover, we show that these mechanisms interact in
   important ways and that prior beliefs that the Court is a legalistic
   institution magnify the effect of updating one's ideological proximity

   ground these arguments on Alastair Smith's () broader concept of
   competency costs. Our analysis of presidential legislative success from
   1953 to 2001 demonstrates the existence of foreign policy competency
   costs by showing that public disapproval of presidential handling of

   control method provides a systematic way to choose comparison units in
   comparative case studies. This systematization opens the door to precise
   quantitative inference in small-sample comparative studies, without
   precluding the application of qualitative approaches. Borrowing the
   expression from Sidney Tarrow, the synthetic control method allows

   they value the debt relief this government benefit brings. However, they
   also perceive it as a just reward for work, which legitimizes a
   temporary increase in consumption. Furthermore, unlike other
   means-tested government transfers, the credit is seen as a springboard
   for upward mobility. Thus, by conferring dignity and spurring dreams,
   the EITC enhances feelings of citizenship and social inclusion.

AB Korpi and Palme's (1998) classic "The Paradox of Redistribution and
   Strategies of Equality" claims that universal social policy better
   reduces poverty than social policies targeted at the poor. This article
   revisits Korpi and Palme's classic, and in the process, explores and
   informs a set of enduring questions about social policy, politics, and
   social equality. Specifically, we investigate the relationships between
   three dimensions of welfare transfers-transfer share (the average share
   of household income from welfare transfers), low-income targeting, and
   universalism-and poverty and preferences for redistribution. We analyze
   rich democracies like Korpi and Palme, but we also generalize to a
   broader sample of developed and developing countries. Consistent with
   Korpi and Palme, we show (1) poverty is negatively associated with
   transfer share and universalism; (2) redistribution preferences are
   negatively associated with low-income targeting; and (3) universalism is
   positively associated with transfer share. Contrary to Korpi and Palme,
   redistribution preferences are not related to transfer share or
   universalism; and low-income targeting is neither positively associated
   with poverty nor negatively associated with transfer share. Therefore,
   instead of the "paradox of redistribution" we propose two new paradoxes
   of social policy: non-complementarity and undermining. The
   non-complementarity paradox entails a mismatch between the dimensions
   that matter to poverty and the dimension that matters to redistribution
   preferences. The undermining paradox emphasizes that the dimension
   (transfer share) that most reduces poverty tends to increase with the
   one dimension (low-income targeting) that reduces support for
   redistribution.

AB Income gains in the top 1 percent are the primary cause for the rapid
   growth in U.S. inequality since the late 1970s. Managers and executives
   of firms account for a large proportion of these top earners. Chief
   executive officers (CEOs), in particular, have seen their compensation
   increase faster than the growth in firm size. We propose that changes in
   the macro patterns of the distribution of CEO compensation resulted from
   a process of diffusion within localized networks, propagating higher pay
   among corporate executives. We compare three possible explanations for
   diffusion: director board interlocks, peer groups, and educational
   networks. The statistical results indicate that corporate director
   networks facilitate social comparisons that generate the observed pay
   patterns. Peer and education network effects do not survive a novel
   endogeneity test that we execute. A key implication is that local
   diffusion through executive network structures partially explains the
   changes in macro patterns of income distribution found in the inequality
   data.

AB That social capital matters is an established fact in the social
   sciences. Less clear, however, is how different forms of social capital
   affect gender disadvantages in career advancement. Focusing on a
   project-based type of labor market, namely the U.S. film industry, this
   study argues that women suffer a "closure penalty" and face severe
   career disadvantages when collaborating in cohesive teams. At the same
   time, gender disadvantages are reduced for women who build social
   capital in open networks with higher degrees of diversity and
   information flow. Using large-scale longitudinal data on career profiles
   of about one million performances by 97,657 film actors in 369,099 film
   productions between the years 1929 and 2010, I analyze career survival
   models and interaction effects between gender and different measures of
   social capital and information openness. Findings reveal that female
   actors have a higher risk of career failure than do their male
   colleagues when affiliated in cohesive networks, but women have better
   survival chances when embedded in open, diverse structures. This study
   contributes to the understanding of how and what type of social capital
   can be either a beneficial resource for otherwise disadvantaged groups
   or a constraining mechanism that intensifies gender differences in
   career advancement.

AB Political opportunity theory has proven extremely generative,
   highlighting the importance of macro-structural shifts in making
   established authorities vulnerable to insurgent challenge. But as
   critics point out, political opportunity theory flattens both culture
   and agency, and has fared poorly in explaining the timing of insurgency.
   Re-theorizing opportunity as leveraged by particular practices, rather
   than independently conferring to groups, redresses these limits,
   revealing the proximate causes of mobilization and influence. For a
   strategic test, this article revisits the forging ground of opportunity
   theory. Why did President Harry S. Truman, initially an apologist for
   the slow pace of racial reform in 1945-46, suddenly become an avid
   advocate of civil rights? Opportunity scholars argue that
   macro-structural forces caused Truman to advocate civil rights,
   generating the opportunity for insurgency by blacks as a group. But
   event structure analysis reveals how Black Anti-colonialist practices
   leveraged opportunities afforded by the earlier Progressive Challenge to
   compel Truman to adopt civil rights advocacy. Civil rights advocacy, in
   turn, allowed Truman to repress Black Anti-colonialist practices, even
   while setting the stage for the Civil Rights Movement to come. Different
   forms of insurgent practice leveraged opportunities created by different
   institutional cleavages; the same opportunities did not advantage all
   insurgency by a social group.

AB Transitions from state socialism created a startling range of initial
   economic outcomes, from renewed growth to deep economic crises. Debates
   about the causes have largely ignored the political disruptions due to
   regime change that coincided with sudden initial recessions, and they
   have defined the problem as relative growth rates over time rather than
   abrupt short-run collapse. Political disruptions were severe when states
   broke apart into newly independent units, leading to hyperinflation,
   armed warfare, or both. Even absent these disruptions, the
   disintegration of communist parties inherently undermined economic
   activity by creating uncertainty about the ownership of state assets.
   The protracted deterioration of the party-state prior to the breakup of
   the Soviet Union generated widespread conflict over control of assets,
   which crippled economic activity across the Soviet successor states. A
   more rapid path to regime change was less disruptive in other
   post-communist states, and the problem was absent in surviving communist
   regimes. Comparative accounts of regime change frame an analysis of
   panel data from 31 countries after 1989 that distinguishes the early
   1990s from subsequent years. A wide range of variables associated with
   alternative explanations have little evident impact in accounting for
   the onset and severity of the early 1990s recessions.

AB Much research finds that human rights treaties fail to improve domestic
   practices unless governments are held accountable in some fashion. The
   implication is that noncompliance can be attributed to insincere
   commitments and willful disobedience. I challenge this claim for a core
   but overlooked treaty: the International Covenant on Economic, Social,
   and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Few analysts have studied the ICESCR
   because its terms are difficult to implement and suitable measures for
   judging compliance are hard to find. I analyze its association with
   income inequality, using data for more than 100 countries (1981 to 2005)
   and methods that account for the possibility of reverse causality.
   ICESCR membership reduces inequality in both developed and developing
   countries, although the relationship is stronger for developed
   countries-precisely those with the greatest capacity to implement their
   obligations. Other key determinants of income inequality and treaty
   compliance-left partisanship, union density, workers' rights, and
   democracy-do not systematically condition the effects of ICESCR
   membership. The ICESCR is therefore quite effective in reducing
   inequality, an outcome likely explained by renewed global attention to
   socioeconomic rights during the neoliberal era.

   understanding of protest influence is limited; several recent studies
   have failed to detect any positive effect. We investigate sit-in protest
   by black college students in the U.S. South in 1960, which targeted
   segregated lunch counters. An original dataset of 334 cities enables us
   to assess the effect of protest while considering the factors that
   generate protest itself-including local movement infrastructure,
   supportive political environments, and favorable economic conditions. We
   find that sit-in protest greatly increased the probability of
   desegregation, as did protest in nearby cities. Over time, desegregation
   in one city raised the probability of desegregation nearby. In addition,
   desegregation tended to occur where opposition was weak, political
   conditions were favorable, and the movement's constituency had economic
   leverage.

   We assume that the two 'trigger' groups at the boundaries of the VET

   to examine to learn more about the performance of the German VET system

AB Analysing trends in the social openness of society has for decades been
   a central aspect of sociological research on inequality. In this
   tradition, I describe long-term developments of intergenerational social
   mobility and reproduction in (West) Germany during the 20th century,
   paying particular attention to relevant mechanisms and conceptual
   issues. The empirical analyses draw upon data from all cohorts of the
   (West) German Life History Study (GLHS). They integrate selected aspects
   from life-course research and demography into mobility analyses, such as
   a focus on the family context, links between intergenerational and
   intragenerational mobility, and a prospective conception of mobility.
   Results indicate that a trend towards more openness has obviously slowed
   down or even reversed for the cohorts born after the mid-1950s. Cohorts
   also differ in the biographical timing when the impact of
   intergenerational mobility unfolds. Social mobility and reproduction are
   stepwise processes that are structured by families, employment, and, in
   particular, education. The analyses demonstrate the value of life-course
   data for macro-sociological analyses.

AB Trends in family formation in post-war Germany during the past 50 years
   are investigated for women in East and West Germany. The analysis
   explores to what extent they are the result of the changing composition
   of women's educational attainment, labour force participation, and
   marital status, and to what extent it corresponds with altered fertility
   behaviour in different socio-structural groups. The German Life History
   Study provides an excellent database to answer this question covering
   the whole post-war period in East and West Germany during and after the
   'Golden Age of Marriage'. While in the former German Democratic Republic
   (GDR), increasing educational attainment and labour force participation
   of women did not inhibit early family formation, in West Germany, a
   non-linear trend in the age at family formation can be observed in the
   cohorts born after World War II. A growing segment of the female
   population suffered from high opportunity costs of being a mother, which
   led to a postponement of the first birth and a rise in childlessness.
   However, there is good reason to expect that the trend will come to an
   end and fertility will increase moderately in the future.

AB What happens in the occupational careers of men if the intergenerational
   continuity in status reproduction is disrupted by the failure to
   reproduce the parental level of educational attainment? We frame this
   failure as a risk for intergenerational status maintenance and ask
   whether such a risk induces extra effort by way of compensation. By
   studying eight birth cohorts born between 1919 and 1971 characterized by
   largely differing conditions with regard to educational and occupational
   opportunities, we examine how macro-social conditions contribute to
   opportunities to compensate for such failure later on. In examining this
   question, we add a new piece to the puzzle of how social origin and
   education contribute to status attainment and of how the social context
   shapes these linkages across historical time. We estimated multilevel
   growth curve models to assess the effect of educational downward
   mobility (EDM) on the development of occupational status over the
   career. Our empirical results show that the status of men who experience
   EDM increases faster over the course of their careers. Moreover, these
   men reach a slightly higher status as compared with their peers who had
   reached at least the same educational level as their fathers. The
   prevailing macro-societal conditions did not cause variation in the
   effect of EDM on men's career attainment.

   partnered women's employment from the 1940s into the first decade of the

   and family-related responsibilities in women's lives. Based on an
   analysis of the institutionally and culturally shaped opportunity
   structures that define the conditions for partnered women's employment,
   we identify distinct periods of support and derive hypotheses on
   cohort-specific developments. The empirical analysis largely confirms
   that a divergence between East and West German women's employment
   patterns started as early as in the 1950s. East-West differences in
   labour market participation were strongest among women born around 1940.
   For successive cohorts of East and West German women, the employment
   patterns converged. Whereas the labour market participation of West
   German women gradually increased over time, the employment pattern of
   East German women adjusted to the West German pattern after unification,
   resulting in an increase of part-time employment and non-employment, in
   particular among mothers. The article concludes by discussing
   implications of these trends for the future of the male breadwinner

AB Existing research analyzes the effects of cross-national and temporal
   variation in income inequality on public opinion; however, research has
   failed to explore the impact of variation in inequality across citizens'
   local residential context. This article analyzes the impact of local
   inequality on citizens' belief in a core facet of the American
   ethosmeritocracy. We advance conditional effects hypotheses that
   collectively argue that the effect of residing in a high-inequality
   context will be moderated by individual income. Utilizing national
   survey data, we demonstrate that residing in more unequal counties
   heightens rejection of meritocracy among low-income residents and
   bolsters adherence among high-income residents. In relatively equal
   counties, we find no significant differences between high- and
   low-income citizens. We conclude by discussing the implications of
   class-based polarization found in response to local inequality with
   respect to current debates over the consequences of income inequality
   for American democracy.

AB I propose and test a theoretical framework that explains institutional
   change in international relations. Like firms in markets, international
   institutions are affected by the underlying characteristics of their
   policy areas. Some policy areas are prone to produce institutions facing
   relatively little competition, limiting the outside options of member
   states and impeding redistributive change. In comparison, institutions
   facing severe competition will quickly reflect changes in underlying
   state interests and power. To test the theory empirically, I exploit
   common features of the Bretton Woods institutionsthe International
   Monetary Fund and World Bankto isolate the effect of variation in policy
   area characteristics. The empirical tests show that, despite having
   identical membership and internal rules, bargaining outcomes in the
   Bretton Woods institutions have diverged sharply and in accordance with
   the theory.

AB Prevailing work argues that foreign investment reduces corruption,
   either by competing down monopoly rents or diffusing best practices of
   corporate governance. We argue that the mechanisms generating this
   relationship are not clear because the extant empirical work is too
   heavily drawn from aggregations of total foreign investment entering an
   economy. Alternatively, we suggest that openness to foreign investment
   has differential effects on corruption even within the same country and
   under the same domestic institutions over time. We argue that foreign
   firms use bribes to enter protected industries in search of rents, and
   therefore we expect variation in bribe propensity across sectors
   according to expected profitability. We test this effect using a list
   experiment embedded in three waves of a nationally representative survey
   of 20,000 foreign and domestic businesses in Vietnam, finding that the
   effect of economic openness on the probability to engage in bribes is
   conditional on policies that restrict investment.

AB We model two aspects of executives in parliamentary democracies:
   Decision-making authority is assigned to individuals, and private
   information is aggregated through communication. When information is
   relevant to all policies and communication is private, all decisions
   should be centralized to a single politician. A government that holds
   cabinet meetings, where information is made available to all decision
   makers, outperforms one where communication is private: A multimember
   cabinet can be optimal; it need not be single peaked around the most
   moderate politician or ideologically connected. Centralization is
   nonmonotonic in the degree of ideological divergence. In a large
   cabinet, all power should be given to the most moderate politician. Even
   when uncertainty is policy specific and a single politician is informed
   on each policy, power should never be fully decentralized. Our model
   provides a justification for centralized authority and cabinet meetings
   that enhance the quality of policy.

AB Roll-call votes are widely employed to infer the ideological
   proclivities of legislators. However, many roll-call matrices are
   characterized by high levels of nonresponse. Under many circumstances,
   nonresponse cannot be assumed to be ignorable. We examine the
   consequences of violating the ignorability assumption that underlies
   current methods of roll-call analysis. We present a basic estimation
   framework to model nonresponse and vote choice concurrently, build a
   model that captures the logic of competing principals that underlies
   accounts of nonresponse in many legislatures, and illustrate the payoff
   of addressing nonignorable nonresponse through both simulated and real
   data. We conclude that modeling presumed patterns of nonignorable
   nonresponse can yield important inferential payoffs over current models
   that assume random missingness, but we also emphasize that the decision
   to model nonresponse should be based on theoretical grounds since one
   cannot rely on measures of goodness of fit for the purpose of model
   comparison.

AB We argue that individuals use responsibility attribution heuristics that
   apply to collective decisions made, for example, by families, teams
   within firms, boards in international organizations, or coalition
   governments. We conduct laboratory and online experiments to tease out
   the heuristics subjects use in their responsibility attribution for
   collective decision makers. The lab experiments comprise a collective
   dictator game in which decision makers have weighted votes and
   recipients can punish individual decision makers. Our results show that
   recipients punish unfair allocations and mainly target the decision
   maker with proposal power and with the largest vote share. We find weak
   evidence that decision makers with veto power are targeted or that
   recipients punish proportional to vote share. The online experiment
   demonstrates that subjects indeed believe that the decision maker with
   proposal power has the most influence on the collective decision
   outcome. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories of
   vote choice.

   find multiple instances of pricing strategy distortions for the largest

AB It is commonly argued that a presidential candidate will be helped in a
   state by having a governor of the same party in office. However, there
   is little research to support this claim. To address this question, we
   use a regression discontinuity design, which allows us to estimate the
   causal effect of gubernatorial party control. We show that a
   presidential candidate is in fact hurt by having a governor from the
   same party. On average, this penalty is a 3-4 percentage point reduction
   in a state's presidential vote share in the following election. We also
   show that voters punish the presidential party in gubernatorial midterm
   elections. Having established these relationships, we explore why this
   is the case. The likely explanation is a variation of the ideological
   balancing argument, whereby voters' choices for one office are
   conditional on which party holds office at a different level.

   other schools. The "cream skimming" effect is increasing in the degree
   of heterogeneity within schools, the school choice take-up rate of
   strong students relative to weak students, and the dependence of school
   outcomes on student body quality. We use the formula to investigate the
   cream skimming effect of hypothetical voucher programs on the high
   school graduation rate and other outcomes of the students who would
   remain in public school. We find small effects across a wide variety of
   model specifications and types of modest voucher programs.

   through imperceptible increases in goods prices. Adopting this empirical
   scenario, the analysis demonstrates that an increase in the national
   minimum wage produces a value-added tax effect on consumer prices that
   is more regressive than a typical state sales tax and allocates benefits
   as higher earnings nearly evenly across the income distribution. These
   income-transfer outcomes sharply contradict portraying an increase in

AB This analysis challenges claims that regime type determines national

   of national economic performance across political systems; specifically,
   that negotiations, disagreements, and compromises between decentralized
   decision-making partisans (e.g., citizens, business representatives,
   professional associations, labor, and public administrators) are the
   underlying causal mechanism explaining the non-monotonic relationship
   between different types of political system and economic performance.
   Countries with high levels of public deliberation more often experience
   stable growth outcomes, while other countries can make radical changes
   in economic policy with uncertain outcome. The variation in public
   deliberation within regime type is significant, especially amongst
   authoritarian regimes. One startling implication is that, in certain
   situations, impressive gains in economic growth can be achieved only at
   the expense of active negotiation and participation in the policy-making

   overlooked procedural elements of America's democratic system. This
   study adds a new element to scholarship on institutional design and
   citizen participation by way of a survey-based experiment conducted in
   the midst of the 2008 campaign. The results show that institutional
   choices are not neutral. Nominating candidates through caucuses rather
   than primaries not only reduces the number of participants, but also
   significantly affects the ideological composition of the electorate.
   Caucuses produce a more ideologically consistent electorate than do
   primaries, because policy centrists appear to avoid caucuses. This
   experimental finding is strongly buttressed by the observational data on

AB Lobbies are active participants in international co-operation. In a

   rewards to influence their government to make pro-co-operation policy
   adjustments. The effect of lobbies depends on the type and intensity of
   their preferences. If the lobbies are 'internationally benefiting' -
   that is, they are interested in whether the foreign government
   reciprocates with adjustments of its own, they unambiguously improve
   co-operation. However, if the lobbies are 'domestically benefiting' -
   that is, they are interested in their own government's policy, they are
   less beneficial for co-operation. A domestically benefiting lobby that
   is willing to compensate its government even without foreign reciprocity
   undermines the credibility of punishing free riders. This article

   is also influenced by the political and news context. This article
   provides a theoretical argument for two independent factors that should
   increase the president's vulnerability to scandal: low approval among

   agenda. Using new data and statistical approaches, I find strong support
   for both claims. These results suggest that contextual factors shape the

AB We study a change in maternity leave entitlements in Norway. Mothers
   giving birth before July 1, 1977, were eligible for 12 weeks of unpaid
   leave, while those giving birth after that date were entitled to 4
   months of paid leave and 12 months of unpaid leave. The increased time
   spent with the child led to a 2 percentage point decline in high school
   dropout rates and a 5 percent increase in wages at age 30. These effects
   were larger for the children of mothers who, in the absence of the
   reform, would have taken very low levels of unpaid leave.

AB This article uncovers a new mechanism linking oil wealth to autocratic
   regime survival: the investigation tests whether increases in oil wealth
   improve the survival of autocracies by lowering the chances of
   democratization, reducing the risk of transition to subsequent
   dictatorship, or both. Using a new measure of autocratic durability
   shows that, once models allow for unit effects, oil wealth promotes
   autocratic survival by lowering the risk of ouster by rival autocratic
   groups. Evidence also indicates that oil income increases military
   spending in dictatorships, which suggests that increasing oil wealth may
   deter coups that could have caused a regime collapse.

AB Prevention in public policy is much discussed but rarely theorized. This
   article begins with a theoretical framework for reflecting on the
   political economy of prevention in advanced capitalist economies that
   integrates the analysis of preventive policies across the social,
   environmental and economic domains. The next two sections survey
   prevention initiatives in social policy and climate change policy,
   respectively. These mainly focus on the last three decades and are based
   mainly on UK evidence. The article then considers the relative absence
   of prevention in contemporary economic policy and management: today's
   neo-liberal economic and political order powerfully constrains
   preventive public policy. The final section outlines an alternative
   social political economy that prioritizes preventive and precautionary
   policy making.

AB This article extends theoretical arguments regarding the impact of
   economic globalization on policy making to electoral turnout and
   considers how distinct dimensions of globalization may produce different
   effects. It theorizes that constraints on government policy that reduce
   incentives to vote are more likely to be induced by foreign ownership of
   capital, while compensation through increased government spending is
   more likely (if at all) to be the product of structural shifts in
   production associated with international trade. Using data from
   twenty-three OECD countries from 1970-2007, the study finds strong
   support for the ownership-constraint hypothesis in which foreign
   ownership reduces turnout, both directly and - in strict opposition to
   the compensation hypothesis - indirectly by reducing government spending
   (and thus the importance of politics). The results suggest that
   increased foreign ownership, especially the most mobile capital flows,
   can explain up to two-thirds of the large declines in turnout over
   recent decades.

AB Recent studies find that high levels of black-white segregation
   increased rates of foreclosures and subprime lending across US
   metropolitan areas during the housing crisis. These studies speculate
   that segregation created distinct geographic markets that enabled
   subprime lenders and brokers to leverage the spatial proximity of
   minorities to disproportionately target minority neighborhoods. Yet, the
   studies do not explicitly test whether the concentration of subprime
   loans in minority neighborhoods varied by segregation levels. We address
   this shortcoming by integrating neighborhood-level data and spatial
   measures of segregation to examine the relationship between segregation
   and subprime lending across the 100 largest US metropolitan areas.
   Controlling for alternative explanations of the housing crisis, we find
   that segregation is strongly associated with higher concentrations of
   subprime loans in clusters of minority census tracts but find no
   evidence of unequal lending patterns when we examine minority census
   tracts in an aspatial way. Moreover, residents of minority census tracts
   in segregated metropolitan areas had higher likelihoods of receiving
   subprime loans than their counterparts in less segregated metropolitan
   areas. Our findings demonstrate that segregation played a pivotal role
   in the housing crisis by creating relatively larger areas of
   concentrated minorities into which subprime loans could be efficiently
   and effectively channeled. These results are consistent with existing
   but untested theories on the relationship between segregation and the
   housing crisis in metropolitan areas.

AB Social mobility is now a matter of greater political concern in Britain
   than at any time previously. However, the data available for the
   determination of mobility trends are less adequate today than two or
   three decades ago. It is widely believed in political and in media
   circles that social mobility is in decline. But the evidence so far
   available from sociological research, focused on intergenerational class
   mobility, is not supportive of this view. We present results based on a
   newly-constructed dataset covering four birth cohorts that provides
   improved data for the study of trends in class mobility and that also
   allows analyses to move from the twentieth into the twenty-first
   century. These results confirm that there has been no decline in
   mobility, whether considered in absolute or relative terms. In the case
   of women, there is in fact evidence of mobility increasing. However, the
   better quality and extended range of our data enable us to identify
   other mobility problems' than the supposed decline. Among the members of
   successive cohorts, the experience of absolute upward mobility is
   becoming less common and that of absolute downward mobility more common;
   and class-linked inequalities in relative chances of mobility and
   immobility appear wider than previously thought.

AB Complex human traits are likely to be affected by many environmental and
   genetic factors, and the interactions among them. However, previous
   gene-environment interaction (GaEuro...xaEuro...E) studies have
   typically focused on one or only a few genetic variants at a time. To
   provide a broader view of GaEuro...xaEuro...E, this study examines the
   relationship between 403 genetic variants from 39 genes and youth
   delinquency and violence. We find evidence that low social control is
   associated with greater genetic risk for delinquency and violence and
   high/moderate social control with smaller genetic risk for delinquency
   and violence. Our findings are consistent with prior GaEuro...xaEuro...E
   studies based on a small number of genetic variants, and more
   importantly, we show that these findings still hold when a large number
   of genetic variants are considered simultaneously. A key implication of
   these findings is that the expression of multiple genes related to
   delinquency depends on the social environment: gene expression is likely
   to be amplified in low-social-control environments but tends to be
   suppressed in high/moderate-social-control environments. This study not
   only deepens our understanding of how the social environment shapes
   individual behavior, but also provides important conceptual and
   methodological insights for future GaEuro...xaEuro...E research on
   complex human traits.

AB Recent research on social contagion has demonstrated significant effects
   of network topology on the dynamics of diffusion. However, network
   topologies are not given a priori. Rather, they are patterns of
   relations that emerge from individual and structural features of
   society, such as population composition, group heterogeneity, homophily,
   and social consolidation. Following Blau and Schwartz, the author
   develops a model of social network formation that explores how social
   and structural constraints on tie formation generate emergent social
   topologies and then explores the effectiveness of these social networks
   for the dynamics of social diffusion. Results show that, at one extreme,
   high levels of consolidation can create highly balkanized communities
   with poor integration of shared norms and practices. As suggested by
   Blau and Schwartz, reducing consolidation creates more crosscutting
   circles and significantly improves the dynamics of social diffusion
   across the population. However, the author finds that further reducing
   consolidation creates highly intersecting social networks that fail to
   support the widespread diffusion of norms and practices, indicating that
   successful social diffusion can depend on moderate to high levels of
   structural consolidation.

AB This article presents hiring as an emotional process rooted in
   interpersonal evaluation. Drawing from Randall Collins's theory of
   interaction ritual, the author offers a qualitative case study of elite
   professional service firms to unpack how employers' emotional reactions
   to applicants in job interviews affect hiring evaluations. She finds
   that employers use subjective feelings of excitement and enthusiasm
   toward candidates-akin to Collins's concept of emotional energy-to
   evaluate applicants and make hiring decisions. With these data, she
   constructs an original theoretical framework of emotional energy
   development, which highlights the qualities that tend to produce or
   inhibit the subjective experience of emotional energy in job interviews.
   Additionally, she outlines the particular phases of an encounter where
   energy gains and losses are most consequential for influencing hiring
   outcomes and inequalities. She discusses the implications of these
   findings for research on hiring, labor market stratification, and
   interaction rituals.

AB Research shows that enforcing cooperation using contracts or tangible
   sanctions can backfire, undermining people's intrinsic motivation to
   cooperate: when the enforcement is removed, people are less trusting or
   trustworthy than when there is no enforcement to begin with. The author
   examines whether reputation systems have similar consequences for
   generalized trust and trustworthiness. Using a web-based experiment
   simulating online market transactions (studies 1 and 2), he shows that
   reputation systems can reinforce generalized trust and trustworthiness,
   unlike contractual enforcement or relational enforcement based on
   repeated interactions. In a survey experiment (study 3), he finds that
   recalling their eBay feedback scores made participants more trusting and
   trustworthy. These results are predicated on the diffuse nature of
   reputational enforcement to reinforce perceptions of trust and
   trustworthiness. These results have implications for understanding how
   different forms of governance affect generalized trust and
   trustworthiness.

AB Empirical treatments of agency have not caught up with theoretical
   explication; empirical projects almost always focus on concurrent
   beliefs about one's ability to act successfully without sufficiently
   attending to temporality. The authors suggest that understanding the
   modern life course necessitates a multidimensional understanding of
   subjective agency involving (a) perceived capacities and (b) perceived
   life chances, or expectations about what life holds in store. The
   authors also suggest that a proper understanding of agency's potential
   power within a life course necessitates moving beyond the
   domain-specific expectations more typical of past sociological work.
   Using the Youth Development Study, the authors employ a scale of general
   life expectations in adolescence to explore the potential influence of a
   general sense of optimistic life expectations in addition to the
   traditional approach on a range of important outcomes.

   consumption, aesthetic taste, and personal morality. Drawing on a total
   of 22,572 pairwise correlations from the General Social Survey
   (1972-2010), the authors provide comprehensive empirical support for the
   anecdotal accounts. Moreover, most ideological differences in lifestyle
   cannot be explained by demographic covariates alone. The authors propose
   a surprisingly simple solution to the puzzle of lifestyle politics.
   Computational experiments show how the self-reinforcing dynamics of
   homophily and influence dramatically amplify even very small elective
   affinities between lifestyle and ideology, producing a stereotypical

   one in which we live.

AB The historic increase in U.S. incarceration rates made the transition
   from prison to community common for poor, prime-age men and women.
   Leaving prison presents the challenge of social integration-of
   connecting with family and finding housing and a means of subsistence.
   The authors study variation in social integration in the first months
   after prison release with data from the Boston Reentry Study, a unique
   panel survey of 122 newly released prisoners. The data indicate severe
   material hardship immediately after incarceration. Over half of sample
   respondents were unemployed, two-thirds received public assistance, and
   many relied on female relatives for financial support and housing. Older
   respondents and those with histories of addiction and mental illness
   were the least socially integrated, with weak family ties, unstable
   housing, and low levels of employment. Qualitative interviews show that
   anxiety and feelings of isolation accompanied extreme material
   insecurity. Material insecurity combined with the adjustment to social
   life outside prison creates a stress of transition that burdens social
   relationships in high-incarceration communities.

AB "Robust standard errors" are used in a vast array of scholarship to
   correct standard errors for model misspecification. However, when
   misspecification is bad enough to make classical and robust standard
   errors diverge, assuming that it is nevertheless not so bad as to bias
   everything else requires considerable optimism. And even if the optimism
   is warranted, settling for a misspecified model, with or without robust
   standard errors, will still bias estimators of all but a few quantities
   of interest. The resulting cavernous gap between theory and practice
   suggests that considerable gains in applied statistics may be possible.
   We seek to help researchers realize these gains via a more productive
   way to understand and use robust standard errors; a new general and
   easier-to-use "generalized information matrix test" statistic that can
   formally assess misspecification (based on differences between robust
   and classical variance estimates); and practical illustrations via
   simulations and real examples from published research. How robust
   standard errors are used needs to change, but instead of jettisoning
   this popular tool we show how to use it to provide effective clues about
   model misspecification, likely biases, and a guide to considerably more
   reliable, and defensible, inferences. Accompanying this article is
   software that implements the methods we describe.

AB The list experiment, also known as the item count technique, is becoming
   increasingly popular as a survey methodology for eliciting truthful
   responses to sensitive questions. Recently, multivariate regression
   techniques have been developed to predict the unobserved response to
   sensitive questions using respondent characteristics. Nevertheless, no
   method exists for using this predicted response as an explanatory
   variable in another regression model. We address this gap by first
   improving the performance of a naive two-step estimator. Despite its
   simplicity, this improved two-step estimator can only be applied to
   linear models and is statistically inefficient. We therefore develop a
   maximum likelihood estimator that is fully efficient and applicable to a
   wide range of models. We use a simulation study to evaluate the
   empirical performance of the proposed methods. We also apply them to the
   Mexico 2012 Panel Study and examine whether vote-buying is associated
   with increased turnout and candidate approval. The proposed methods are
   implemented in open-source software.

AB Over the past eight decades, millions of people have been surveyed on
   their political opinions. Until recently, however, polls rarely included
   enough questions in a given domain to apply scaling techniques such as
   IRT models at the individual level, preventing scholars from taking full
   advantage of historical survey data. To address this problem, we develop
   a Bayesian group-level IRT approach that models latent traits at the
   level of demographic and/or geographic groups rather than individuals.
   We use a hierarchical model to borrow strength cross-sectionally and
   dynamic linear models to do so across time. The group-level estimates
   can be weighted to generate estimates for geographic units. This
   framework opens up vast new areas of research on historical public
   opinion, especially at the subnational level. We illustrate this
   potential by estimating the average policy liberalism of citizens in
   each U.S. state in each year between 1972 and 2012.

AB Electoral rules have the potential to affect the size and composition of
   the voting public. Yet scholars disagree over whether requiring voters
   to register well in advance of Election Day reduces turnout. We present
   a new approach, using web searches for "voter registration" to measure
   interest in registering, both before and after registration deadlines
   for the 2012 U.S. presidential election. Many Americans sought
   information on "voter registration" even after the deadline in their
   state had passed. Combining web search data with evidence on the timing
   of registration for 80 million Americans, we model the relationship
   between search and registration. Extrapolating this relationship to the
   post-deadline period, we estimate that an additional 3-4 million
   Americans would have registered in time to vote, if deadlines had been
   extended to Election Day. We test our approach by predicting out of
   sample and with historical data. Web search data provide new
   opportunities to measure and study information-seeking behavior.

AB Electoral competitiveness is a key explanatory construct across a broad

   no valid measure of electoral competitiveness exists that applies across
   different electoral and party systems. We argue that one particular type
   of electoral competitiveness-electoral risk-can be estimated across
   institutional contexts and matters most for incumbent behavior. We
   propose, estimate, and make available a crossnationally applicable
   measure for elections in 22 developed democracies between 1960 and 2011.
   Unlike extant alternatives, our measure captures vote volatility and is
   constructed at the party (not system) level, exogenous to most policy
   predictors, and congruent with the perceptions and incentives of

   spacing, noninstantaneous observation, overlapping observation times,
   and sampling or other measurement error-that are ignored in most
   statistical analyses because of model limitations. Ignoring these
   properties can lead not only to biased coefficients but also to
   incorrect inference about the direction of causality. This article
   develops a continuous-time model to overcome these limitations. This new
   model treats observations as noisy samples collected over an interval of
   time and can be viewed as a generalization of the vector autoregressive
   model. Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical examples demonstrate
   the importance of modeling these features of the data.

AB In November 2010, the WikiLeaks organization began the release of over
   250,000 diplomatic cables sent by U.S. embassies to the U.S. State
   Department, uploaded to its website by (then) Private Manning, an
   intelligence analyst with the U.S. Army. This leak was widely condemned,
   including by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. We assess the
   severity of the leak by considering the size of the disclosure relative
   to all diplomatic cables that were in existence at the time-a quantity
   that is not known outside official sources. We rely on the fact that the
   cables that were leaked are internally indexed in such a way that they
   may be treated as a sample from a discrete uniform distribution with
   unknown maximum; this is a version of the well-known "German Tank
   Problem." We consider three estimators that rely on discrete
   uniformity-maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and frequentist unbiased
   minimum variance-and demonstrate that the results are very similar in
   all cases. To supplement these estimators, we employ a regression-based
   procedure that incorporates the timing of cables' release in addition to
   their observed serial numbers. We estimate that, overall, approximately
   5% of all cables from this timeframe were leaked, but that this number
   varies considerably at the embassy-year level. Our work provides a
   useful characterization of the sample of documents available to
   international relations scholars interested in testing theories of
   "private information," while helping inform the public debate
   surrounding Manning's trial and 35-year prison sentence.

AB Questions about racial or ethnic group identity feature centrally in

   are often difficult to obtain, out of date, or otherwise unavailable.
   The proliferation of publicly available geocoded person names provides
   one potential source of such data-if researchers can effectively link
   names and group identity. This article examines that linkage and
   presents a methodology for estimating local ethnic or racial composition
   using the relationship between group membership and person names. Common
   approaches for linking names and identity groups perform poorly when
   estimating group proportions. I have developed a new method for
   estimating racial or ethnic composition from names which requires no
   classification of individual names. This method provides more accurate
   estimates than the standard approach and works in any context where
   person names contain information about group membership. Illustrations
   from two very different contexts are provided: the United States and the

AB The accuracy of published findings is compromised when researchers fail
   to report and adjust for multiple testing. Preregistration of studies
   and the requirement of preanalysis plans for publication are two
   proposed solutions to combat this problem. Some have raised concerns
   that such changes in research practice may hinder inductive learning.
   However, without knowing the extent of underreporting, it is difficult
   to assess the costs and benefits of institutional reforms. This paper
   examines published survey experiments conducted as part of the
   Time-sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences program, where the
   questionnaires are made publicly available, allowing us to compare
   planned design features against what is reported in published research.
   We find that: (1) 30% of papers report fewer experimental conditions in
   the published paper than in the questionnaire; (2) roughly 60% of papers
   report fewer outcome variables than what are listed in the
   questionnaire; and (3) about 80% of papers fail to report all
   experimental conditions and outcomes. These findings suggest that
   published statistical tests understate the probability of type I errors.

AB Does improved communication provided by modern cellphone technology
   affect the rise or fall of violence during insurgencies? A priori
   predictions are ambiguous; introducing cellphones can enhance insurgent
   communications but can also make it easier for the population to share
   information with counterinsurgents and creates opportunities for signals
   intelligence collection. We provide the first systematic micro-level
   test of the effect of cellphone communication on conflict using data on
   Iraq's cellphone network (2004-2009) and event data on violence. We show
   that increased mobile communications reduced insurgent violence in Iraq,
   both at the district level and for specific local coverage areas. The
   results provide support for models of insurgency that focus on
   noncombatants providing information as the key constraint on violent
   groups and highlight the fact that small changes in the transaction
   costs of cooperating with the government can have large macro effects on
   conflict.

AB Conventional wisdom holds that the creation of international, court-like
   institutions helps countries to peacefully settle trade conflicts,
   thereby enhancing overall welfare. Many have argued, however, that these
   institutions remain ultimately ineffective because they merely reflect
   the distribution of power in the anarchic international system. We argue
   that international litigation provides economic spillovers that create
   opportunities for judicial free-riding and explore empirically how
   litigation in the World Trade Organization affects bilateral trade
   between countries involved in a trade dispute. We use a matching
   approach to compare the dynamics of trade flows between countries that
   experienced a panel ruling with trade relations of observably similar
   country pairs that did not experience a ruling. Based on this comparison
   we find that sectoral exports from complainant countries to the
   defendant increase by about $7.7 billion in the three years after a
   panel ruling. However, countries that have proactively filed a complaint
   and carried the main costs of litigation do not systematically gain more
   than less-active third parties that merely joined an existing trade
   dispute. This suggests that international judicial institutions can
   provide positive economic externalities and may thereby lead to a less
   power-based distribution of the gains from trade.

   I test my theory combining spatial autoregressive (SAR) models,

   willingness to join international institutions reflect a genuine
   commitment to human rights reform or is it just "cheap talk?" We analyze
   this question using a new data set of more than 1,000 leading European
   Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) cases. Since new democracies face
   judgments that are more difficult to implement than established
   democracies, we employ a genetic matching algorithm to balance the data
   set. After controlling for bureaucratic and judicial capacity, we find
   that new democracies do implement similar ECtHR judgments initially more
   quickly than established democracies, but this effect reverses the
   longer a judgment remains pending. Although new democracies have
   incentives to implement judgments quickly, they sometimes lack checks
   and balances that help ensure implementation should an executive resist.

AB Following older debates in international relations literature concerning
   the relative importance of domestic versus systemic factors, newer
   debates emphasize interdependence among states and the complex
   interactions between systemic and domestic factors. As globalization and
   democratization advance, theories and empirical models of international
   politics have become more complicated. We present a systematic
   theoretical categorization of relationships between domestic and
   systemic variables. We use this categorization so that scholars can
   match their theory to the appropriate empirical model and assess the
   degree to which systemic factors affect their arguments. We also present
   two advances at the frontier of these empirical models. In one, we
   combine hierarchical models of moderating relationships with spatial
   models of interdependence among units within a system. In the other, we
   provide a model for analyzing spatial interdependence that varies over
   time. This enables us to examine how the level of interdependence among
   units has evolved. We illustrate our categorization and new models by
   revisiting the recent international political economy (IPE) debate over
   the relationship between trade policy and regime type in developing
   countries.

AB Certain types of militant groups-those suffering from leadership

   deficits exacerbate the principal-agent problem between leaders and foot
   soldiers, who have stronger incentives to harm civilians. We establish
   the validity of this proposition with a tripartite research strategy
   that balances generalizability and identification. First, we demonstrate
   in a sample of militant organizations operating in the Middle East and
   North Africa that those lacking centralized leadership are prone to
   targeting civilians. Second, we show that when the leaderships of
   militant groups are degraded from drone strikes in the
   Afghanistan-Pakistan tribal regions, the selectivity of organizational
   violence plummets. Third, we elucidate the mechanism with a detailed
   case study of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a Palestinian group that
   turned to terrorism during the Second Intifada because pressure on
   leadership allowed low-level members to act on their preexisting
   incentives to attack civilians. These findings indicate that a lack of
   principal control is an important, underappreciated cause of militant
   group violence against civilians.

AB Do human rights prosecutions deter dictatorships from relinquishing
   power? Advances in the study of human rights show that prosecutions
   reduce repression in transition countries. However, prosecuting
   officials for past crimes may jeopardize the prospects of regime change
   in countries that have not transitioned, namely dictatorships. The
   creation of the International Criminal Court has further revitalized
   this debate. This article assesses how human rights prosecutions
   influence autocratic regime change in neighboring dictatorships. We
   argue that when dictators and their elite supporters can preserve their
   interests after a regime transition, human rights prosecutions are less
   likely to deter them from leaving power. Using personalist dictatorship
   as a proxy for weak institutional guarantees of posttransition power,
   the evidence indicates that these regimes are less likely to democratize
   when their neighbors prosecute human rights abusers. In other
   dictatorships, however, neighbor prosecutions do not deter regimes from
   democratizing.

AB According to recent studies, international human rights treaties are
   ineffective, counterproductive, or else beneficial for only those
   countries that tend to respect human rights regardless of treaty
   membership. Analysts often attribute gaps between human rights
   principles and practices to willful disobedience, self-interested
   defection, and ineffective enforcement. Using two-stage regression
   models to analyze compliance with the International Covenant on Civil
   and Political Rights, I examine whether countries' inability (as opposed
   to unwillingness) to implement treaty terms is also responsible for the
   gap between commitment and compliance. I find that one dimension of
   state capacity in particular-bureaucratic efficacy-enhances levels of
   compliance with civil, political, and physical integrity rights
   provisions. These findings lend credence to an important aspect of the
   managerial approach-that noncompliance is often inadvertent and
   conditioned by a state's ability to implement treaty terms.

AB Policy-makers and political scientists have long believed that states
   must make policy with an eye to maintaining a good reputation,
   especially a good reputation for resolve. Recent work, however, has
   argued that reputations for resolve do not form, and hence that past
   actions do not influence observers' behavior in subsequent interactions.
   This conclusion is theoretically problematic and unsupported by the
   evidence offered by reputation critics. In particular, juxtaposing
   reputation for resolve to power and interests is misleading when past
   actions influence observers' beliefs about interests, while the common
   approach of looking at crisis decision making misses the impact of
   reputation on general deterrence. We thus derive hypotheses about
   conflict onset from both the arguments of reputation critics and the
   logic of more standard reputation arguments, which we put to statistical
   test. We find that past action is closely connected to subsequent
   dispute initiation and that the effects of reputation generalize beyond
   the immediate circumstances of the past dispute. Although reputation is
   not all-important, leaders are well advised to consider the reputational
   implications of policy decisions in international conflict.

   choice, the marginal distributions of EV and CV can be expressed as

   essentially unrestricted preference distributions. These results hold
   even when the distribution and dimension of unobserved heterogeneity are
   neither known nor identified, and utilities are neither quasilinear nor
   parametrically specified. The welfare distributions take simple forms
   that are easy to compute in applications. In particular, average EV for
   a price rise equals the change in average Marshallian consumer surplus
   and is smaller than average CV for a normal good. These nonparametric
   point-identification results fail for ordered choice if the unit price
   is identical for all alternatives, thereby providing a connection to

   all preferences over monetary lotteries that satisfy negative certainty
   independence together with basic rationality postulates. Such
   preferences can be represented as if the agent were unsure of how to
   evaluate a given lottery p; instead, she has in mind a set of possible
   utility functions over outcomes and displays a cautious behavior: she
   computes the certainty equivalent of p with respect to each possible
   function in the set and picks the smallest one. The set of utilities is
   unique in a well defined sense. We show that our representation can also
   be derived from a cautious completion of an incomplete preference
   relation.

AB This paper presents a new method for the analysis of moral hazard
   principal-agent problems. The new approach avoids the stringent
   assumptions on the distribution of outcomes made by the classical
   first-order approach and instead only requires the agent's expected
   utility to be a rational function of the action. This assumption allows
   for a reformulation of the agent's utility maximization problem as an
   equivalent system of equations and inequalities. This reformulation in
   turn transforms the principal's utility maximization problem into a
   nonlinear program. Under the additional assumptions that the principal's
   expected utility is a polynomial and the agent's expected utility is
   rational in the wage, the final nonlinear program can be solved to
   global optimality. The paper also shows how to first approximate
   expected utility functions that are not rational by polynomials, so that
   the polynomial optimization approach can be applied to compute an
   approximate solution to nonpolynomial problems. Finally, the paper
   demonstrates that the polynomial optimization approach extends to
   principal-agent models with multidimensional action sets.

   can be quite poor, and that current solutions based on Bartlett-type
   corrections or bootstrap based on unrestricted parameter estimators are
   unsatisfactory, in particular in those cases where also asymptotic (2)
   tests fail most severely. In this paper, we solve this inference problem
   by showing the novel result that a bootstrap test where the null
   hypothesis is imposed on the bootstrap sample is asymptotically valid.
   That is, not only does it have asymptotically correct size, but, in
   contrast to what is claimed in existing literature, it is consistent
   under the alternative. Compared to the theory for bootstrap tests on the
   co-integration rank (Cavaliere, Rahbek, and Taylor, 2012), establishing
   the validity of the bootstrap in the framework of hypotheses on the
   co-integrating vectors requires new theoretical developments, including
   the introduction of multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with
   random (reduced rank) drift parameters. Finally, as documented by Monte
   Carlo simulations, the bootstrap test outperforms existing methods.

AB This paper uses the rollout of the first Community Health Centers (CHCs)
   to study the longer-term health effects of increasing access to primary
   care. Within ten years, CHCs are associated with a reduction in
   age-adjusted mortality rates of 2 percent among those 50 and older. The
   implied 7 to 13 percent decrease in one-year mortality risk among
   beneficiaries amounts to 20 to 40 percent of the 1966 poor/non-poor
   mortality gap for this age group. Large effects for those 65 and older
   suggest that increased access to primary care has longer-term benefits,
   even for populations with near universal health insurance.

   heterogeneous firm models of trade (relative to homogeneous firm
   models). Under some parameter restrictions, the trade elasticity is
   constant and is a sufficient statistic for welfare, along with the
   domestic trade share. However, even small deviations from these
   restrictions imply that trade elasticities are variable and differ
   across markets and levels of trade costs. In this more general setting,
   the domestic trade share and endogenous trade elasticity are no longer
   sufficient statistics for welfare. Additional empirically observable
   moments of the micro structure also matter for welfare.

AB In response to the seven authors who offered comments on my paper, I
   have tried to synthesize and distill common themes. Foremost among them
   is the charge to look forward, not only to consider probable
   developments and implications for how this 'molecular reinscription of
   race' will unfold in forensics and clinical medicine, but as well to
   suggest how the discipline of Sociology can and should respond. But as
   several of the commentators noted, this is not just a matter for a
   single discipline, but should be fertile ground for coordinated
   empirical investigation by such fields as the Social Studies of Science,
   Anthropology of Medicine, and Critical Race Theory. For sociologically
   informed reasons, social scientists should be wary of the unanticipated
   consequences of collaboration with human molecular geneticists who come
   to the table deploying databases with pre-fabricated categories of race,
   thereby poised to provide genetic explanations of social outcomes based
   upon race and ethnicity. A cautionary note is provided explaining how
   and why some joint projects are advised, some are ill-advised.

   2012 Olympics. We provide a critical discussion of the mobility
   conflicts, problems and criticisms which emerged from our research with
   local people in the Stratford and wider Newham areas of London, where
   most Olympic events were located. The paper is divided into four broad
   parts. First, we identify and discuss the relevant components of the
   mobilities paradigm' in social science which underpin our analysis.
   Second, we briefly outline our research methods, centring particularly
   on fieldwork and interviews with different social groups. Third, we
   examine in detail the six main themes of mobility politics which were
   evident at London 2012, relating to social context, event construction,
   event mobility systems, commercial mobilities, the mobile politics of
   exclusion, and contested modes of mobility. In doing so, we seek to
   extend the mobilities paradigm by introducing various concepts and
   keywords - notably on the three-speed city, entryability, mobility
   panics, instrumental mobility, and corporate kettling - which may be
   utilized by social scientists to examine mobility systems in other
   social contexts. We conclude by reaffirming the significance of
   mobility-focused research at sport and other mega-events, and by
   indicating future lines of inquiry for social scientists.

AB The literature on political participation asserts that protest has
   increased over the last four decades, all over the world. This trend is
   derived from surveys asking questions about participation in various
   forms of protest, including demonstrations, boycotts, and unofficial
   strikes. The latter question made sense in the context in which it was
   formulated, Britain in the early 1970s, and with regard to the original
   methodological aim, measuring protest potential'. The absence of a
   generic question on strikes, however, distorts our understanding of
   protest. Two sources of data on Britain in the 1980s and 1990s - a
   population survey and an event catalogue - comprehensively measure
   strikes. They show that strikes greatly outnumbered demonstrations and
   other forms of protest. Another claim in the literature, that protesters
   are highly educated, no longer holds once strikes are properly counted.
   Strikes in Britain, as in many countries, have dramatically declined
   since the 1980s. This decline more than offsets any increase in
   demonstrations and boycotts, meaning that the total volume of protest
   has decreased. The episode illustrates how survey questions, when
   replicated without scrutiny, can misconstrue social trends.

   However, it is by now well-known that these measures identify
   substantially different people as being poor. In this research note, I
   seek to demonstrate that there are at least three ways to understand the
   mismatch between low income and material deprivation, relating to three
   different forms of identification: identifying poor households,
   identifying groups at risk of poverty and identifying trends in material
   poverty over time. Drawing on data from the British Household Panel
   Survey, I show that while low income and material deprivation identify
   very different households as being poor, and display distinct trends
   over time, in many cases they identify the same groups at being at risk
   of material poverty.

AB With the growing elusiveness of the state apparatus in late modernity,
   military service is one of the last institutions to be clearly
   identified with the state, its ideologies and its policies. Therefore,
   negotiations between the military and its recruits produce acting
   subjects of citizenship with long-lasting consequences. Arguing that
   these negotiations are regulated by multi-level (civic, group, and
   individual) contracts, we explore the various meanings that these
   contracts obtain at the intersectionality of gender, class, and
   ethnicity; and examine how they shape the subjective experience of
   soldierhood and citizenship. More particularly, we analyse the meaning
   of military service in the retrospective life stories of Israeli Jewish
   women from various ethno-class backgrounds who served as army
   secretaries - a low-status, feminine gender-typed occupation within a
   hyper-masculine organization. Findings reveal that for women of the
   lower class, the organizing cultural schema of the multi-level contract
   is that of achieving respectability through military service, which
   means being included in the national collective. Conversely, for
   middle-class women, it is the sense of entitlement that shapes their
   contract with the military, which they expect to signify and maintain
   their privileged status. Thus, while for the lower class, the
   multi-level contract is about inclusion within the boundaries of the
   national collective, for the dominant groups, this contract is about
   reproducing social class hierarchies within national boundaries.

AB Although field experiments have documented the contemporary relevance of
   discrimination in employment, theories developed to explain the dynamics
   of differential treatment cannot account for differences across
   organizational and institutional contexts. In this article, I address
   this shortcoming by presenting the main empirical findings from a
   multi-method research project, in which a field experiment of ethnic
   discrimination in the Norwegian labour market was complemented with
   forty-two in-depth interviews with employers who were observed in the
   first stage of the study. While the experimental data support earlier
   findings in documenting that ethnic discrimination indeed takes place,
   the qualitative material suggests that theorizing in the field
   experiment literature have been too concerned with individual and
   intra-psychic explanations. Discriminatory outcomes in employment
   processes seems to be more dependent on contextual factors such as the
   number of applications received, whether requirements are specified, and
   the degree to which recruitment procedures are formalized. I argue that
   different contexts of employment provide different opportunity
   structures for discrimination, a finding with important theoretical and
   methodological implications.

AB Past research has shown that the invention of the plow played a key role
   in human social evolution. The physical strength required to drive a
   plow gave men a comparative advantage in economically productive
   activity; this created gender norms that have persisted to the present
   day. However, there is an additional channel through which the invention
   of the plow could have influenced modern human societies: the creation
   of an economic environment favoring not only the sexual division of
   labor but also the selection of men with more upper-body strength. In
   this case, modern populations descended from plow-using communities
   should exhibit greater sexual dimorphism than others, and greater
   dimorphism should be associated with higher androgen levels in males.
   This has a direct epidemiological implication, because the incidence of
   many cancers is correlated with androgen levels. Using international
   data on cancer incidence, we show that there is a strong association
   between the magnitude of sex differences in cancer risk and the
   proportion of the population descended from plow-using communities.
   Although both of these characteristics are correlated with other
   socio-economic factors (such as the level of economic development),
   controlling for such correlations does not diminish estimates of the
   magnitude of the association between cancer risk and plow ancestry. In
   addition to their implications for cancer epidemiology, the results
   suggest that the international variation in gender norms might also be
   associated with variation in androgen levels.

AB The first wave of global trade, in which the Dutch East India Company
   (VOC) was a key player, writ large the problem of how "principals" could
   ensure that overseas "agents" protected company interests. The two
   principal mechanisms were suppression of opportunism and permission of
   agents to engage in private trade. There is near consensus in past
   research that the rigidity of the VOC in not permitting private trade
   left it unable to emulate more nimble rivals and contributed to its
   demise. Drawing on unique 18th-century archival data, a time-series
   analysis revises this assumption, showing that private-trade
   regulations, as a historical form of adaptation, occurred as a response
   to declining performance and exercised a beneficial financial impact.
   From the 1740s, control was more flexible than typically asserted,
   attempting to balance permission and prohibition. If principals
   recognized the economic upside of private trade, they were apprehensive
   about its social consequences. The study underlines the need of dynamic
   models to capture complex historical events, illustrating how seeming
   inactivity may in fact mask inconsistent activity. It also contributes
   to better understanding historical transitions when forms of adaptation
   may prove beneficial in the short run, but are insufficient to prevent
   decline in the long run.

   line with expectations about the institutional and normative context of
   the Netherlands, we concluded that women adjusted their work schedules
   to their fertility plans and that couples had a preference for the
   personal care of their children rather than relying on formal care
   arrangements. Non-standard schedules served as a means to achieve this.

AB Previous research has shown that the transition to parenthood is a
   critical life-course stage. Using data from the Household, Income, and
   Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey and fixed-effects panel regression
   models, we investigate changes in men's and women's attitudes to
   mothering and gender divisions of labor following the transition to
   parenthood. Key findings indicate that attitudes become more traditional
   after individuals experience the birth of their first child, with both
   men and women becoming more likely to support mothering as women's most
   important role in life. We argue that these changes are due to both
   changes in identity and cognitive beliefs associated with the experience
   of becoming a parent, as well as institutional arrangements that support
   traditional gender divisions. More broadly, our results can be taken as
   strong evidence that attitudes are not stable over the life course and
   change with the experience of life events.

AB Mexican Americans are a large group whose mobility patterns can provide
   important insight into immigrant assimilation processes. It is well
   known that Mexicans have not attained economic parity with whites, but
   there is considerable debate about the degree to which Mexican
   immigrants and their American-born children experience mobility over
   their lives. We contribute to this literature by studying Mexican
   American wealth ownership, focusing on three interrelated processes.
   First, we examine childhood poverty and inheritances to establish
   financial starting points and to identify the degree to which resources
   from prior generations affect wealth ownership. Second, we study
   impediments to mobility in young adulthood to understand how childhood
   conditions create early adult obstacles to well-being. Third, we study
   midlife net worth and homeownership to better understand whether
   childhood and young adult impediments necessarily reduce adult wealth
   ownership. We find high levels of early life disadvantage among Mexican
   Americans, but these disadvantages are least pronounced in the second
   and third generations compared to the first generation. Consistent with
   prior research, we also find high levels of young adult impediments to
   mobility for Mexican Americans. However, we find that these early
   roadblocks do not necessarily translate into lower adult wealth: we show
   that Mexican Americans have less total wealth than whites but more than
   African Americans, even when early life impediments are controlled. Our
   results suggest that Mexican Americans are establishing a solid
   financial foundation that is likely to lead to long-term class
   stability.

AB Is there a relationship between family income inequality and income
   mobility across generations in the United States? As family income
   inequality rose in the United States, parental resources available for
   improving children's health, education, and care diverged. The amount
   and rate of divergence also varied across US states. Researchers and
   policy analysts have expressed concern that relatively high inequality
   might be accompanied by relatively low mobility, tightening the
   connection between individuals' incomes during childhood and adulthood.
   Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the National
   Longitudinal Survey of Youth, and various government sources, this paper
   exploits state and cohort variation to estimate the relationship between
   inequality and mobility. Results provide very little support for the
   hypothesis that inequality shapes mobility in the United States. The
   inequality children experienced during youth had no robust association
   with their economic mobility as adults. Formal analysis reveals that
   offsetting effects could underlie this result. In theory,
   mobility-enhancing forces may counterbalance mobility-reducing effects.
   In practice, the results suggest that in the US context, the
   intergenerational transmission of income may not be very responsive to
   changes in inequality.

AB Inequality between groups is frequently maintained through the
   construction and legitimation of inter-group cultural differences. I
   draw on Blau's multiform heterogeneity and complex contagion models to
   theorize and develop a relational mechanism that shows how inequality
   can be preserved when additional, new bases of differentiating between
   groups layer over existing ones. I investigate the conditions under
   which variations in the distribution of the population across stratified
   groups and homophily of social networks along the stratifying attribute
   interact in such a way that a belief/practice diffuses widely in one
   group but not the other-an outcome referred to as differential
   diffusion. I also analyze how size of ego networks and adoption
   thresholds affect differential diffusion. Using mathematical and
   agent-based models, I find a positive correlation between adoption
   thresholds and homophily: when social networks are highly homophilous
   (e.g., race and socioeconomic class), uneven diffusion of non-normative
   behavior reproduces inequality; inclusive networks (e.g., in diverse
   city schools), in contrast, reestablish inequality through differential
   diffusion of low-risk behavior. This suggests that cultivating diversity
   is likely to mitigate inequality preservation in conservative situations
   where adoption of new beliefs/practices needs considerable affirmation.
   Encouraging status-based solidarity is more appropriate in receptive
   contexts where adoption of new behaviors entails comparatively lower
   risk. The results also imply that analyses of diffusion need to be
   sensitive to contextual factors, including homophily, cultural
   institutionalization of the diffusing material, and population
   distribution. Finally, I extend Ridgeway's seminal work to show how
   relational structure can not only construct status hierarchies but also
   contribute to their symbolic maintenance.

AB Recent research has demonstrated that Latinos have been hit hardest by
   the US foreclosure crisis. In this article, I combine place
   stratification and spatial assimilation theory to explain why Latinos
   suffered a devastating double blow during the foreclosure crisis. Using
   a national sample of borrowers who received risky mortgage loans during
   the boom and following them through the crisis, I find that Latinos were
   most likely subject to high-cost subprime lending and especially risky
   low-/no-documentation lending as Latino suburbanization and immigration
   peaked along with national home prices. As a result, while Latino
   borrowers were no less likely to lose their homes to foreclosure than
   blacks prior to the crisis or in the Rust Belt, they were significantly
   more likely to lose their homes after the crisis began and in the Sand
   States of Arizona, California, Florida, and Nevada. Taken together, the
   results demonstrate the risk of rising Latino immigration,
   suburbanization, and homeownership during the stages of the housing boom
   and foreclosure crisis.

AB Social class confers a bundle of capabilities, practices, and beliefs
   that are conventionally assumed to be hierarchical, rigid, and
   self-perpetuating. However, this framework often belies the fact that
   these qualities needn't be necessarily or exhaustively advantageous. In
   particular, social change may render obsolete class-linked
   characteristics that were advantageous in previous periods. Drawing on
   interviews with homeowners at risk of foreclosure and a yearlong
   ethnography of a housing counseling organization, I find that although
   the housing crisis of the "Great Recession" affected both working- and
   middle-class homeowners alike, the practices of working-class borrowers
   better positioned them to exploit a number of informational advantages
   in the rapidly changing mortgage modification setting. My findings are a
   departure from existing research that treats middle-class capabilities
   and practices as intrinsically advantageous.

AB Analyses of the multiple cognitive structures and social effects of
   humor seldom look at why these tend to center on particular topics. The
   puzzle of how humor can be highly varied yet somehow constrained by its
   source "material" is explored using a corpus of over 600 incidents, not
   of deliberate jokes, but of the "wilder," unplanned laughter that
   occurred during a set of interviews with economists-professionals who at
   the time (1999-2000) enjoyed an unprecedented degree of status and
   influence. The analysis finds that the source material for this laughter
   typically involved three kinds of socially structured contradiction:
   between ideals and reality, between different socially situated
   viewpoints, and between experiences occurring at different times. This
   illustrates how particular kinds of content can have a special
   laughter-inducing potential, and it suggests that wild laughter may at
   root be an interactional mechanism for dealing with social
   incongruity-even for members of relatively powerful groups. It is argued
   that this could not only help solve the larger puzzle of simultaneous
   variety and constraint in deliberate comedy, but also explain why the
   characteristic structures of humor are associated with a particular
   range of social effects in the first place.

AB From the perspective of historical institutionalism, I argue that state
   capacity, democracy, and their interaction shape the distribution of
   human vulnerability in natural disasters. The ruling elite, irrespective
   of whether it is democratic, has the incentive to develop state capacity
   to prevent damage caused by natural disasters, which is considered a
   threat to its rule and revenue. To win elections in a democracy, the
   elite may increase public spending for disaster mitigation in favor of
   voters' demands. Democracy also empowers civil society and stimulates
   social spending, which benefits vulnerable citizens. Thus, a strong
   state capacity effectively reduces human vulnerability, especially in a
   democracy. I used panel data from 150 countries between 1995 and 2009 to
   demonstrate the relationship among state capacity, democracy, and the
   impact of disasters. After controlling for the density and magnitude
   continuity of natural-disaster hazards, the empirical results I obtained
   from the multilevel models indicate that democracy reduces the disaster
   mortality rate, and a strong state capacity mitigates the effect of a
   disaster on a population, especially in a democracy. I also found that
   state capacity and democracy are more effective in preventing human
   losses caused by predictable disasters such as floods and storms, rather
   than earthquakes.

AB The completion of the first draft of the Human Genome Map in 2000 was
   widely heralded as the promise and future of genetics-based medicines
   and therapies - so much so that pundits began referring to the new
   century as The Century of Genetics'. Moreover, definitive assertions
   about the overwhelming similarities of all humans' DNA (99.9 per cent)
   by the leaders of the Human Genome Project were trumpeted as the end of
   racial thinking about racial taxonomies of human genetic differences.
   But the first decade of the new century brought unwelcomed surprises.
   First, gene therapies turned out to be far more complicated than any had
   anticipated - and instead the pharmaceutical industry turned to a focus
   on drugs that might be related' to population differences based upon
   genetic markers. While the language of personalized medicine' dominated
   this frame, research on racially and ethnically designated populations
   differential responsiveness to drugs dominated the empirical work in the
   field. Ancestry testing and admixture research' would play an important
   role in a new kind of molecular reification of racial categories.
   Moreover, the capacity of the super-computer to map differences
   reverberated into personal identification that would affect both the
   criminal justice system and forensic science, and generate new levels of
   concern about personal privacy. Social scientists in general, and
   sociologists in particular, have been caught short by these developments
   - relying mainly on assertions that racial categories are socially
   constructed, regionally and historically contingent, and politically
   arbitrary. While these assertions are true, the imprimatur of scientific
   legitimacy has shifted the burden, since now admixture research' can
   claim that its results get at the reality' of human differentiation, not
   the admittedly flawed social constructions of racial categories. Yet
   what was missing from this framing of the problem: admixture research'
   is itself based upon socially constructed categories of race.

AB Economic institutions structure links between labor-market informality
   and social stratification. The present study explores how periods of
   institutional change and post-socialist market transition alter
   network-based job finding, in particular informal recruitment. We
   highlight how market transitions affect both the prevalence and
   distribution of network-based recruitment channels: open-market
   environments reduce informal recruitment's prevalence but increase its
   association with high wages. We test these propositions using the case
   of the former East Germany's market transition and a comparison with
   West Germany's more stable institutional environment. Following
   transition, workers in lower tiers increasingly turned toward formal
   intermediaries, active employee search, and socially "disembedded"
   matches. Meanwhile, employers actively recruited workers into
   higher-wage positions. Implications for market transition theory and
   post-socialist stratification are discussed.

AB A growing literature investigates the relationship between ethnic
   diversity and social trust. Comparative research in the European context
   employing country-level indicators has predominantly produced
   inconclusive results. This study examines the relationship between
   immigration-related diversity and social trust at the sub-national level
   of European regions. The regional perspective allows the capture of
   relevant variations in ethnic context while it still generates
   comparable results for a broader European context. Using survey data
   from the European Social Survey 2002-2010 merged with immigration
   figures from the European Labour Force Survey, this study builds upon
   previous research by testing the relationships between various diversity
   indicators and social trust in cross-sectional and longitudinal
   perspective. In addition, it investigates the role of economic and
   cultural contexts as moderators. The results show that across European
   regions, different aspects of immigration-related diversity are
   negatively related to social trust. In longitudinal perspective, an
   increase in immigration is related to a decrease in social trust. Tests
   of the conditional hypotheses reveal that regional economic growth and
   ethnic polarization as a cultural context moderate the relationship.
   Immigration growth is particularly strongly associated with a decrease
   in social trust in contexts of economic decline and high ethnic
   polarization. However, there is some evidence that in contexts of low
   polarization the relationship is actually positive.

AB Residential crowding is linked with the well-being of children and
   adults. Although extensive U.S. research indicates variation in crowding
   by race/ethnicity and nativity, far less work investigates differences
   in crowding by immigrants' citizenship and legal status. Data from the
   Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A.FANS) are used to focus
   on Latinos, the group most likely to experience crowding in the United
   States. The analyses examine heterogeneity in crowding among four
   distinct groups of Latinos: U.S.-born naturalized citizens, authorized
   noncitizen immigrants, and unauthorized noncitizen immigrants. Theories
   of locational attainment and immigrant assimilation are used to develop
   hypotheses about whether intra-Latino variation in crowding is explained
   by differences in individual, household, and other characteristics, and
   which structural factors also interfere in this process. Multivariate
   analyses indicate that neither nativity nor citizenship status are
   linked with residential crowding, net of other variables. In contrast,
   lacking legal status does have residual impacts on the outcome:
   unauthorized noncitizen immigrants are more crowded than authorized
   noncitizens and all other groups. The results offer support for the
   spatial assimilation and place stratification perspectives on locational
   attainment. These findings contribute to emerging scholarship
   documenting the unique structural challenges that unauthorized Latino
   immigrants experience in residential outcomes and other domains in the
   United States.

AB The study examines supply-side mechanisms of occupational gender
   segregation, analysing work values and their effects on adolescents'
   gender-(a)typical occupational aspirations. Supply-side theory assumes
   that women develop higher preferences for a good work/life balance and
   for social work content in their youth, whereas men develop higher
   extrinsic work values. This gender typicality in work values is expected
   to affect aspirations for gender-typical occupations. Following
   arguments on intergenerational transmission, parental gender role
   behaviour is also explored as a determinant for the development of
   gender-(a) typical occupational aspirations. It is argued that this
   plays a role mainly when family cohesion is high. Analyses of
   adolescents in the German Socio-Economic Panel Study show no
   gender-specific differences between work values of a good work/life
   balance. Furthermore, those work values do not affect preferences for
   gender-(a)typical occupations. Additionally, although men have higher
   extrinsic work values than women, these values affect aspirations for
   male occupations only for women. The strongest explanatory power is for
   social work values which are more important for women and increase
   aspirations for female occupations for both genders, in line with
   supply-side approaches. Parental gender role behaviour partly explains
   gender-(a)typical occupational aspirations, primarily for male
   adolescents with a good family climate.

AB Research has shown that women on average express more positive attitudes
   towards out-groups than men. We hypothesize that, because of differences
   in the social climate that this gender gap produces, people who spend
   more time in female-dominated groups are likely to develop more positive
   attitudes towards out-groups than people who spend more time in groups
   that are dominated by men. We corroborate our argument with evidence
   from two unique Swedish data sets. On the basis of the first data set,
   we show that students who attend female-dominated school classes are
   more tolerant of immigrants' rights than students attending
   male-dominated school classes. On the basis of the second data set, we
   show that adults who work at female-dominated workplaces are more
   tolerant of immigrants' rights than adults who work at male-dominated
   workplaces. Overall, our findings demonstrate that group gender
   composition is important for understanding the formation of attitudes
   towards out-groups.

AB This article studies the relationship between employee training and
   institutional factors of initial skill formation and industrial
   relations across 14 European countries. Rather than focusing on
   individual participation rates and returns, the aim is to explain the
   observed country variation in training incidence and its returns. It
   turns out that there are direct links between the system of initial
   skill formation and training that differ between incidence and returns.
   Although cross-country training incidence seems to vary according to
   educational attainment levels and the financial input into education,
   the returns to training are strongly associated with the quality and
   stratification of secondary schooling. This finding suggests that the
   aggregate level of training provided is associated with educational
   attainment levels in terms of skill demand as well as educational
   expenditure, whereas training-related productivity gains are higher in
   systems in which school leavers and the workforce actually do possess
   higher skills. Educational stratification seems to increase inequality
   beyond education by increasing training-related earnings differentials.

   choice models and interval regressions show that the predicted negative
   effects of traditional gender role attitudes and of religiosity
   contribute to the explanation of ethnic differences in female labour
   force participation, in addition to human capital and household
   conditions. These factors moreover partly explain differences between

AB This article addresses how modernization processes influenced social
   openness in Hungarian municipalities between 1870 and 1950. Our focus is
   on relative occupational mobility, which reflects the underlying pattern
   of inequalities in attaining class positions. We derive hypotheses from
   the 'theory of industrialization' on the association between social
   fluidity and modernization processes. We test these for a
   late-industrializing country, Hungary. A large-scale historical
   micro-data set, spanning the period 1870-1950 is used to construct 633
   mobility tables based on marriage cohorts within 62 municipalities. We
   specify parsimonious association models to estimate social fluidity from
   each mobility table, and test our hypotheses in a subsequent step, using
   multivariate regression analyses with cohort-and-municipality-based
   indicators of modernization processes. We use a stronger explanatory
   design than previous studies by including fixed effects to control for
   stable historical municipal characteristics. We find that increasing
   educational opportunities led to a decline in nonagrarian manual and
   nonmanual class rigidities, and that industrialization decreased class
   rigidities of the nonmanual classes. Agrarian class reproduction was
   unaffected by modernization. Modernization processes explain most of the
   temporal variation in the social fluidity of manual classes.

AB The increasing popularity of radical right parties in Western Europe has
   received widespread attention. Despite a rather large literature on
   parties with explicitly anti-immigrant platforms, there is surprisingly
   little consensus about the underlying political ideology of this party
   family and its supporters. Particularly lacking is cross-national
   research that maps party positions in two-dimensional political space
   over time. Using Manifesto Project Data (1970-2010), we analyse election
   platforms of parties the literature has identified as radical right and
   show that they have qualitatively changed between 1970 and 2010. Current
   parties differ fundamentally from their predecessors in that nationalist
   claims are paramount. We use the European Social Survey (2002-2010) to
   confirm that voters' attitudes are consistent with contemporary parties'
   platforms. Our results point to a coherent political ideology, which may
   partially explain these parties' recent electoral successes. Based on
   our combined analyses, we conclude that contemporary anti-immigrant
   parties constitute a new and distinct party family, which we term
   neo-nationalist.

AB When buying durable goods, consumers must forecast how much utility they
   will derive from future consumption, including consumption in different
   states of the world. This can be complicated for consumers because
   making intertemporal evaluations may expose them to a variety of
   psychological biases such as present bias, projection bias, and salience
   effects. We investigate whether consumers are affected by such
   intertemporal biases when they purchase automobiles. Using data for more
   than 40 million vehicle transactions, we explore the impact of weather
   on purchasing decisions. We find that the choice to purchase a
   convertible or a four-wheel-drive is highly dependent on the weather at
   the time of purchase in a way that is inconsistent with classical
   utility theory. We consider a range of rational explanations for the
   empirical effects we find, but none can explain fully the effects we
   estimate. We then discuss and explore projection bias and salience as
   two primary psychological mechanisms that are consistent with our
   results. JEL Codes: D03; D12.

AB Evidence of protest expansion both in the United States and abroad has
   stimulated theoretical discussion of a "movement society," with some
   arguing that protest activities are becoming a standard feature of
   democratic politics. In advancing this claim, many have highlighted the
   role of domestic factors for example, generational change or economic
   affluence without fully accounting for the possibility that
   international dynamics may play an important role as well. The lack of
   work is surprising not only because the trend in protest is
   international in scope, but also because work in comparative sociology
   suggests globalization may make an important contribution. This study
   addresses the empirical gap by examining how political globalization (as
   measured by memberships in international organizations) and economic
   globalization (as measured by trade activity and foreign investment)
   influence trends in protest participation. Using data from World Values
   Surveys of 37,716 respondents in 17 advanced democracies merged with
   data on several national and international indicators, this study
   examines how the probability of participating in protest has changed
   over time as a result of these two forms of globalization. The results
   of multivariate, multilevel analysis combined with simulations indicate
   that trends in political globalization have expanded protest activity,
   while trends in economic globalization have limited that expansion.
   These results suggest that social movement scholarship should continue
   to examine the implications of globalization for protest behavior and
   other social movement dynamics.

AB In multi-ethnic nation-states, opposition to immigration has manifested
   itself in attitudes and behaviors. Past research has typically focused
   on:anti-immigrant attitudes, and relied on threat and competition
   theories to explain patterns in such attitudes. These theories suggest
   that perceived threats stemming from new influxes or large
   concentrations of immigrants should prompt dominant groups to protect
   their interests, leading to anti-immigrant attitudes. We extend the
   literature with a focus on anti-immigrant activity, and introduce the
   legitimating contexts model, which argues that dominant groups may
   actually hesitate to engage in exclusionary public actions in places
   where the political and demographic strength of immigrant and ethnic
   groups is strong. In contrast to theories of group threat, we contend
   that in contexts with low levels of immigrant political power and
   demographic strength, anti-immigrant activity is less likely to be
   noticed, let alone challenged, and thus more likely to become part of
   the status quo. Extending political opportunity theory, we also claim
   that conservative elites and voters in local areas coupled with low
   levels of threat further legitimate anti-immigrant activity. We test
   these ideas using a new data set of exclusionary action targeted at
   immigrants in over SO U.S. metropolitan areas. In support of the
   legitimating contexts model, we find that low levels of demographic and
   political threat when immigrants enjoy less power alone and coupled with
   a higher share of conservative voters act to legitimate and encourage
   restrictive events on the part of noninstitutional actors.

AB Prior research on the racial threat perspective and social control
   typically relies on aggregate-level demographic measures and focuses on
   racial, rather than on Latino group, composition. This predominant focus
   in research on racial threat and social control makes it unclear whether
   the assumed linkages are confined to one subordinate group or whether
   other groups, such as Latinos, are viewed as threatening and elicit
   heightened social control reactions as well. In the current study, we
   use data from the Punitive Attitudes Toward Hispanic (PATH) Study, a
   national sample of U.S. residents to investigate the influence of macro-
   and micro-level measures of Latino group threat on punitive Latino
   sentiment. More specifically, we use multilevel models to detect direct
   and interactive relationships between Latino presence and perceived
   Latino threat on punitive sentiment. The findings show that Latino
   population growth and perceived Latino criminal and economic threat
   significantly predict punitive Latino sentiment. Additionally,
   multiplicative models suggest that the effect of perceived criminal
   threat on punitive Latino sentiment is most pronounced in settings that
   have experienced recent growth in the size of the Latino population.

AB A century of urban research has established that percentage black
   associates positively with violence at the neighborhood level. We extend
   traditional structural explanations for this association by drawing
   attention to the political contexts of cities that may influence the
   race-violence link. Drawing on insights from social movement and racial
   politics literatures, we contend that the relationship between
   percentage black and neighborhood violence will be attenuated in cities
   with greater black political opportunities and black mobilization. We
   examine this thesis using multilevel data from the National Neighborhood
   Crime Study that provide sociodemographic and violence data for census
   tracts nested within 87 large cities. We pair these data with city-level
   measures of black political opportunities and mobilization. Multilevel
   analyses reveal that the relationship between percentage black and
   violence varies substantially across cities, and that the average
   positive relationship often is attenuated, and reduced to statistical
   insignificance, in cities with favorable political contexts. We propose
   that the substantive and symbolic benefits set in motion by favorable
   political contexts lay the foundation for neighborhood organization
   against violence.

AB A central mechanism by which medicalization occurs is through domain
   expansion, wherein an existing diagnostic definition widens to include
   cases beyond its original scope. This has been especially commonplace
   with respect to mental illness diagnoses. In contrast, there are few
   clear instances of domain contraction. The controversy surrounding the
   revisions to autism in advance of the publication of the fifth edition
   of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) is
   thus of considerable importance. Many autism advocates feared the new
   definition of autism would exclude a significant number of individuals
   who are already diagnosed. We examine lay claims making to this
   perceived instance of domain contraction through a content analysis of
   online reader comments to a high-profile New York Times article
   reporting on the DSM-5 autism criteria. Our analysis points to an
   amorphous group of social stakeholders who express a variety of concerns
   about unabated medicalization. We also identify the stance of diagnostic
   domain defense, which is an oppositional response by laypeople with a
   personal connection to a diagnosis to a real or perceived challenge to
   the definitional boundaries of that diagnosis. Our analysis explicates
   the dimensions of diagnostic domain defense, which include its grounding
   in experiential certainty and anguish, and the accrual and deployment of
   diagnostic resources. We make a case for the utility of this concept for
   theorizing the relationship between lay claims making, diagnoses, and
   medicalization. We also make a case for the use of online reader
   comments as a way to unobtrusively study lay claims making related to
   pressing social problems in the Internet era.

AB A rising share of employees now regularly engage in working from home
   (WFH), but there are concerns this can lead to "shirking from home." We
   report the results of a WFH experiment at Ctrip, a 16,000-employee,
   NASDAQ-listed Chinese travel agency. Call center employees who
   volunteered to WFH were randomly assigned either to work from home or in
   the office for nine months. Home working led to a 13% performance
   increase, of which 9% was from working more minutes per shift (fewer
   breaks and sick days) and 4% from more calls per minute (attributed to a
   quieter and more convenient working environment). Home workers also
   reported improved work satisfaction, and their attrition rate halved,
   but their promotion rate conditional on performance fell. Due to the
   success of the experiment, Ctrip rolled out the option to WFH to the
   whole firm and allowed the experimental employees to reselect between
   the home and office. Interestingly, over half of them switched, which
   led to the gains from WFH almost doubling to 22%. This highlights the
   benefits of learning and selection effects when adopting modern
   management practices like WFH. JEL Codes: D24, L23, L84, M11, M54, O31.

AB The relationship between religion and volunteering is well documented
   (Putnam and Campbell, 2010; Ruiter and De Graaf, 2006), and a prevalent
   hypothesis for the association is that the effect of religion is
   mediated through religious social networks. However, research on this
   relationship has largely been conducted on majority Christian
   populations in the United States and Europe. In this study, we use two
   data sets, the European Values Study (1999-2008) and the Ethnic Minority
   British Election Survey (2010) to examine this relationship in Britain
   on the general population and ethnic minority population, respectively.
   The results suggest that religion increases volunteering primarily
   through bonding rather than bridging social networks. We also find that
   in non-Christian religions, solitary and collective religious rituals
   may both have an effect on civic participation, but whereas the effect
   of service attendance is mediated through bonding social networks, the
   effect of prayer is mediated more through bridging networks. Finally,
   values of individual autonomy and generalized trust are associated with
   non-religious, but not religious, participation, suggesting an
   alternative secular ethos of civic engagement.

AB Why have some states been captured by specific ethnic elites and their
   clienteles, excluding all others from access to government power?
   Conversely, what explains political inclusion across ethnic divides or,
   in other words, successful 'nation building'? Assuming a relational
   theoretical perspective, I argue that high state capacity to deliver
   public goods, well developed voluntary organizations, and low levels of
   linguistic diversity enhance nation building because they make it easier
   to extend networks of political alliances across an entire territory.
   Contemporary state capacity and linguistic diversity are in turn related
   to levels of state formation achieved during the late 19th century. On
   average, such long-term factors of political development are more
   important for explaining contemporary nation building than political
   institutions (including democracy) or the legacies of imperial rule.
   This is demonstrated on the basis of a cross-national data set covering
   all countries of the world since 1945.

AB This paper examines the implicit health insurance that households

   households with a greater financial cost of bankruptcy make higher
   out-of-pocket medical payments, conditional on the amount of care
   received. In turn, I find that households with greater wealth at risk
   are more likely to hold health insurance. The implicit insurance from
   bankruptcy distorts the insurance coverage decision. Using a

   are three-quarters as large as the average penalties under the

AB How much of the foreclosure crisis can be explained by the large number

   down payments and choose whether to default given income and housing
   shocks. The use of low-down payment loans is initially limited by
   payment-to-income requirements but becomes unrestricted during the boom.
   The model approximates key housing and mortgage market facts before and

   increased number of high-leverage loans originated prior to the crisis
   can explain over 60 percent of the rise in foreclosure rates.

   who observe prices that cannot be reconciled with their reasoning switch
   from perceiving the environment as risky to perceiving it as ambiguous.
   If they are ambiguity-averse, these agents become price-insensitive.
   Results from an experiment show that, consistent with the theory, (i)
   without aggregate risk, mispricing decreases as the fraction of
   price-sensitive agents increases; and (ii) with aggregate risk,
   price-insensitive agents trade to more balanced portfolios.

   argue that whether producers should be expected to take advantage of
   these opportunities depends on the extent to which they are incentivized
   to do so. We use the case of the light cigarette category to test this
   thesis. We argue and find evidence that increasing taken-for-grantedness

AB Using General Social Survey data, we examine perspectives on science and

   groups based on knowledge and attitudes about science, religiosity, and
   preferences for certain religious interpretations of the world. The
   traditional perspective (43 percent) is marked by a preference for
   religion compared to science; the modern perspective (36 percent) holds
   the opposite view. A third perspective, which we call post-secular (21
   percent), views both science and religion favorably. However, when faced
   with competing accounts of events such as creation and evolution,
   post-seculars root their views in religion rather than in mainstream
   science. Regression models indicate that perspectives on science and
   religion do not simply mirror other denominational or ideological
   differences. Furthermore, religio-scientific perspectives shape
   attitudes about political issues where scientific and some religious
   communities diverge, including on abortion rights and stem cell
   research. Overall, most individuals favor either scientific or religious
   ways of understanding, but many scientifically inclined individuals
   prefer certain religious accounts. This suggests that public divisions
   related to science and religion are cultural and epistemological. This
   article underscores the complexity of the boundary between reason and
   faith and highlights the roots of political conflict in perspectives on

AB We know men's violence against women is costly. Yet, we know little
   about the costsor benefitsof women's efforts to end it. This study
   investigates the temporal dynamics of women's earnings and petitioning
   for a Protection from Abuse (PFA) civil restraining order. Women's
   earnings might rise or fall at the time of petitioning but quickly
   return to pre-petitioning levels, a short-term boost or shock; or,
   petitioning might precipitate a longer-term stall or upward shift in
   women's earnings. To test for these effects, we use latent growth curve
   analysis and evaluate women's earnings trajectories over six years. We
   find overwhelming evidence that the period around petitioning is one of
   exceptional earnings instability for petitioners, many of whom
   experience both shocks and stalls. Virtually no one experiences a boost
   in the quarter of petitioning or an upward shift in earnings growth in
   the year after petitioning for a PFA. Welfare, however, buffers negative
   effects of petitioning on women's earnings growth. We also calculate
   lost earnings as the difference between women's counterfactual projected
   and estimated earnings. Our findings inform theoretical and policy
   debates about interventions intended to address poverty and violence
   against women.

AB We know that culture influences people's behavior. Yet estimating the
   exact extent of this influence poses a formidable methodological
   challenge for the social sciences. This is because preferences and
   beliefs are endogenous, that is, they are shaped by individuals' own
   experiences and affected by the same macro-structural conditions that
   constrain their actions. This study introduces a new method to overcome
   endogeneity problems in the estimation of cultural effects by using
   migrant populations. This innovative method uses imputed traits,
   generated from non-migrating equivalents observed at the country of
   origin, as instruments for immigrants' own cultural traits measured at
   the country of destination. By construction, imputed traits are
   exogenous to immigrants' host social environment. The predicted power of
   imputed traits over observed traits in instrumental-variable estimation
   captures the non-idiosyncratic component of preferences and beliefs that
   migrants and non-migrating equivalents share as members of the same
   national-origin group, that is, their culture. I use this innovative
   method to estimate the net exogenous impact of traditional values on
   female labor-force participation in Europe. I find that this impact is
   much larger than standard regression methods would suggest.

AB This article reconciles two seemingly incompatible expectations about
   interpersonal interaction and social influence. One theoretical
   perspective predicts that an increase in interaction between two actors
   will promote subsequent convergence in their attitudes and behaviors,
   whereas another view anticipates divergence. We examine the role of
   political identity in moderating the effects of interaction on
   influence. Our investigation takes place in the U.S. Senatea setting in
   which actors forge political identities for public consumption based on
   the external constraints, normative obligations, and reputational
   concerns they face. We argue that interaction between senators who share
   the same political identity will promote convergence in their voting
   behavior, whereas interaction between actors with opposing political
   identities will lead to divergence. Moreover, we theorize that the
   consequences of political identity for interpersonal influence depend on
   the local interaction context. Political identity's effects on influence
   will be greater in more divided Senate committees than in less divided
   ones. We find support for these hypotheses in analyses of data, spanning
   over three decades, on voting behavior, interaction, and political
   identity in the Senate. These findings contribute to research on social
   influence; elite integration and political polarization; and identity
   theory.

AB This article builds on group position theory and the subcategorization
   model of intergroup contact by illustrating how, in a small-town
   settler-colonial context, contact tends to reproduce, rather than
   challenge, the inequitable racial structure. In Northwestern Ontario,
   Indigenous-settler relations are characterized by widespread intergroup
   marriage and friendship as well as pervasive prejudice and
   discrimination. Using 18 months of fieldwork and 160 interviews and
   surveys with First Nations, Metis, and non-Indigenous residents, I show
   that although contact is associated with less old-fashioned prejudice
   (i.e., overt categorical hostility), it does not necessarily eliminate
   whites' superior sense of group position. Even white individuals who
   have close Indigenous friends or spouses often express laissez-faire
   racism. Three mutually reinforcing social processessubtyping,
   ideology-based homophily, and political avoidance normsinteract to
   sustain whites' sense of group superiority and justifications for racial
   inequity. These processes are facilitated by historical and structural
   conditions, in this case colonization and small-town dynamics.

   matters when white and African American young adults of differing class
   backgrounds navigate key institutions. I find that middle-class young
   adults had more knowledge than their working-class or poor counterparts
   of the rules of the game regarding how institutions worked. They also
   displayed more of a sense of entitlement to ask for help. When faced
   with a problem related to an institution, middle-class young adults
   frequently succeeded in getting their needs accommodated by the
   institution; working-class and poor young adults were less knowledgeable
   about and more frustrated by bureaucracies. This address also shows the
   crucial role of cultural guides who help upwardly mobile adults navigate
   institutions. While many studies of class reproduction have looked at
   key turning points, this address argues that small moments may be
   critical in setting the direction of life paths.

AB Organizations are increasingly subject to rating and ranking by
   third-party evaluators. Research in this area tends to emphasize the
   direct effects of ratings systems that occur when ratings give key
   audiences, such as consumers or investors, more information about a
   rated firm. Yet, ratings systems may also indirectly influence
   organizations when the collective presence of more rated peers alters
   the broader institutional and competitive milieu. Rated firms may be
   more responsive to ratings systems when surrounded by more rated peers,
   and ratings may generate diffuse or spillover effects even among unrated
   firms. We test these arguments by analyzing how rated and unrated firms
   change their pollution behavior when more firms in their peer group are
   rated on environmental performance. Results indicate that the presence
   of more rated peers is often associated with emissions reductions. This
   relationship varies, however, by whether a firm was rated, whether the
   rating was positive or negative (if rated), and, often, features of the
   competitive and regulatory environment.

AB Why has progress toward gender equality in the workplace and at home
   stalled in recent decades? A growing body of scholarship suggests that
   persistently gendered workplace norms and policies limit men's and
   women's ability to create gender egalitarian relationships at home. In
   this article, we build on and extend prior research by examining the
   extent to which institutional constraints, including workplace policies,
   affect young, unmarried men's and women's preferences for their future
   work-family arrangements. We also examine how these effects vary across
   education levels. Drawing on original survey-experimental data, we ask
   respondents how they would like to structure their future relationships
   while experimentally manipulating the degree of institutional constraint
   under which they state their preferences. Two clear patterns emerge.
   First, as constraints are removed and men and women can opt for an
   egalitarian relationship, the majority choose this option, regardless of
   gender or education level. Second, women's relationship structure
   preferences are more responsive than men's to the removal of
   institutional constraints through supportive work-family policy
   interventions. These findings shed light on important questions about
   the role of institutions in shaping work-family preferences,
   underscoring the notion that seemingly gender-traditional work-family
   decisions are largely contingent on the constraints of current
   workplaces.

AB Does it matter that working-class citizens are numerically

   the conventional wisdom in comparative politics has been that it does
   not, that lawmakers from different classes think and behave roughly the
   same in office. In this article, we argue that this conclusion is
   misguided. Past research relied on inappropriate measures of
   officeholders' class backgrounds, attitudes, and choices. Using data on
   18 Latin American legislatures, we show that lawmakers from different
   classes bring different economic attitudes to the legislative process.
   Using data on one least likely case, we also show that pre-voting
   decisions like sponsoring legislation often differ dramatically along
   social class lines, even when political parties control
   higher-visibility decisions like roll-call votes. The unequal numerical
   or descriptive representation of social classes in the world's
   legislatures has important consequences for the substantive
   representation of different class interests.

AB In this article, we consider whether personal relationships can affect

   daughters on the votes of judges. Using new data on the family lives of
   U.S. Courts of Appeals judges, we find that, conditional on the number
   of children a judge has, judges with daughters consistently vote in a
   more feminist fashion on gender issues than judges who have only sons.
   This result survives a number of robustness tests and appears to be
   driven primarily by Republican judges. More broadly, this result
   demonstrates that personal experiences influence how judges make
   decisions, and this is the first article to show that empathy may indeed
   be a component in how judges decide cases.

AB When voters learn about candidates' issue positions during election

   voters remains unanswered in part because of a methodological obstacle:
   learning candidates' issue positions may influence not only voters' vote
   choice but also their issue positions. To surmount this obstacle, we
   attempt to answer this question by examining statewide primary
   elections, which are arguably less vulnerable to this reverse causation
   problem because they lack partisan cues and are of much lower salience
   than presidential elections. Using both existing polling data and our
   own panel Internet surveys, we find that voters learn about the
   ideologies of candidates during statewide primary campaigns and that
   this learning affects their voting decisions in senate and gubernatorial
   primaries. We fail to find similar results for down-ballot primaries,
   raising questions about voters' ability to make informed judgments for

AB Disagreements over whether polarization exists in the mass public have

   is separated from issue position polarization, both sides of the
   polarization debate can be simultaneously correct. Social polarization,
   characterized by increased levels of partisan bias, activism, and anger,
   is increasing, driven by partisan identity and political identity
   alignment, and does not require the same magnitude of issue position
   polarization. The partisan-ideological sorting that has occurred in
   recent decades has caused the nation as a whole to hold more aligned
   political identities, which has strengthened partisan identity and the
   activism, bias, and anger that result from strong identities, even
   though issue positions have not undergone the same degree of
   polarization. The result is a nation that agrees on many things but is
   bitterly divided nonetheless. An examination of ANES data finds strong
   support for these hypotheses.

   offer experimental data purporting to show that dissatisfaction with a
   single Court decision substantially diminishes the institution's
   legitimacy. These findings strongly break with earlier research on the
   Court's institutional support, as the authors recognize. The theoretical
   implications of their findings are profound. If the authors are correct
   that legitimacy is strongly dependent upon satisfying the policy
   preferences and ideological predilections of the American people, the
   essence of legitimacy is fundamentally transformed. Consequently, we
   reinvestigate the relationships among ideology, performance
   satisfaction, and Court legitimacy, unearthing empirical findings that
   diverge markedly from theirs. We conclude with some thoughts about how

AB Extended party network (EPN) theory characterizes political parties in

   collaboratively support favored candidates for office. Electoral
   predictions derived from EPN theory have yet to be tested on a large
   sample of races. We operationalize EPNs in the context of organized
   interest contributions to U.S. House campaigns. We deduce that support
   by a partisan community of interests signals the ideological credibility
   and appeal of a candidate. EPN integration overcomes voter ambiguity
   surrounding challengers' ideological preferences, and resources provided
   by these coordinating interest groups promote a consistent message about
   the candidate. Using data from the 1994-2010 cycles, we apply network
   analysis to detect EPN support of challengers and find that EPN
   integration substantially improves the electoral prospects of
   challengers. The effect of EPN integration is distinct from that of
   campaign resources. The findings provide support for EPN theory, as
   applied to congressional elections.

   win very close elections in the United States House of Representatives
   in recent periods. In this article, we examine whether similar patterns
   occur in other electoral settings, including the U.S. House in other
   time periods, statewide, state legislative, and mayoral races in the
   U.S. and national or local elections in nine other countries. No other
   case exhibits this pattern. We also cast doubt on suggested explanations
   for incumbent success in close House races. We conclude that the
   assumptions behind the RD design are likely to be met in a wide variety
   of electoral settings and offer a set of best practices for RD
   researchers going forward.

AB China's rural-to-urban migration has affected 12.6 million school-age
   rural children who have migrated with their parents and another 22
   million who have been left behind by their migrant parents. Not enough
   is known, either theoretically or empirically, about the causal impact
   of migration on the wellbeing of this large number of Chinese children
   affected by migration. Propensity score matching methods are applied to
   estimate the effects of migration in children 10-15 years old from a
   2010 national survey (N = 2,417). Children's migration has significant
   positive effects on their objective wellbeing but no negative effects on
   their subjective wellbeing. There is little difference between the
   left-behind and non-migrant children across multiple life domains. The
   Rosenbaum bounds tests indicate that the causal effects of child
   migration are sensitive to hidden bias for certain outcomes, but not for
   others.

AB Using RLMS-HSE dataset we analyze labor flows in the Russian labor
   market for 2000-2012. We document the high mobility rate and the
   transitive role played by non-participation. Division of all employed
   into three large groups (budgetary workers, workers in the corporate
   market sector, and employed in the non-corporate or informal sector)
   suggests that budgetary workers are low mobile compared to others, and
   informal workers and economically inactive individuals have higher
   probabilities to become unemployed than those who work formally. The
   paper exploits a few methodological approaches. First, we build
   transition matrices allowing estimate transition probabilities. Second,
   the Shorrocks indexes estimate intensity of mobility. Third, the dynamic
   multinomial logit model explores individual determinants of inter-status
   transitions and structural dependence from the previous labor market
   states. Fourth, we decompose the change in unemployment rate as the
   combination of incoming and outcoming flows. This procedure suggests
   that the decline in unemployment is explained by decrease in incoming
   flows while the outflows remain largely stable. Observed intensity and
   direction off lows fit the institutional configuration of the Russian
   labor market model.
Z4 Используя панельные микроданные РМЭЗ - НИУ ВШЭ, работа анализирует
   основные потоки на российском рынке труда за 2000-2012 гг. Мы отмечаем
   высокий уровень мобильности и значительную транзитивную роль
   неактивности. Деление всех занятых на три большие группы показывает, что
   работники бюджетного сектора отличаются слабой подвижностью по сравнению
   с работниками рыночного сектора, а неформально занятые и экономически
   неактивные имеют более высокие шансы попадания в безработицу по
   сравнению с формально занятыми. Предложенный анализ использует несколько
   методологических приемов. Во-первых, строятся матрицы переходов,
   показывающие вероятности межстатусных перемещений. Во-вторых, индексы
   Шоррокса дают интегральную оценку интенсивности перемещений и позволяют
   представить их в межстрановом контексте. В-третьих, динамическая
   мультиномиальная логит-модель отвечает на вопросы об индивидуальных
   детерминантах межстатусной мобильности и о наличии/отсутствии
   зависимости от прошлых состояний на рынке труда. В-четвертых, показано,
   что снижение безработицы почти полностью объясняется сокращением
   входящих в нее потоков при стабильном по величине оттоке. Наблюдаемые
   интенсивность и направленность потоков хорошо согласуются с действующей
   в России институциональной конфигурацией рынка труда.

AB Contemporaries and historians often blame the errors and tragedies of US
   policy during the Cold War on a dominant narrative of national security:
   the Cold War consensus. Its usual periodization, according to which it
   came together in the late 1940s and persisted until the late 1960s when
   it unraveled amidst the trauma of the Vietnam War, fits well with a
   common theory of change in ideas and discourse. That theory expects
   stasis until a substantial unexpected failure (in this domain, military
   defeat) discredits dominant ideas and unsettles dominant coalitions.
   However, systematic data reveal the standard history of this important
   case to be wrong. Based on a large-scale content analysis of newspaper
   editorials on foreign affairs, this article shows that the Cold War
   narrative was narrower than conventional accounts suggest, that it did
   not coalesce until well into the 1950s, and that it began to erode even
   before the Vietnam War's Americanization in 1965. To make sense of this
   puzzle, I develop an alternative theory of the rise and fall of the
   narratives that underpin and structure debate over national security.
   Rooted in the dynamics of public narrative and the domestic politics of
   the battlefield, the theory argues that military failure impedes change
   in the narrative in whose terms government officials had legitimated the
   mission, whereas victory creates the opportunity for departures from the
   dominant narrative. Process-tracing reveals causal dynamics consistent
   with the theory: failure in the Korean War, which might have undermined
   Cold War globalism, instead facilitated the Cold War narrative's rise to
   dominance (or consensus); and the triumph of the Cuban Missile Crisis
   made possible that dominant narrative's breakdown before the upheaval of
   Vietnam. This hard and important case suggests the need to rethink the
   relationship between success, failure, and change in dominant narratives
   of national securityand perhaps in other policy domains as well.

AB Scholarship on the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows
   has produced valuable insights into the role of host state
   characteristics and home-host relations. This study draws attention to
   another factor in investment decisionsthe political and economic
   relations that home and host states maintain with third-party states.
   More narrowly, we focus on how investors respond to their home-state's
   imposition of economic sanctions against a trading partner. Greater
   economic integration has allowed states to use economic sanctions more
   frequently in recent decades. At the same time, economic sanctions are
   thought to have a distorting effect on global trade and financial flows
   as firms and governments adjust to new constraints. We argue that as
   firms at home in the sanctioning state respond to coercive measures
   against a trading partner by looking for alternative sources of profit,
   they will shift investments to states that can provide indirect access
   to the sanctioned economy. In particular, those states that are
   perceived as prospective sanctions-bustersmajor trading partners of the
   sanctions target or states with a history of sanctions-busting
   behaviorwill benefit disproportionately from the misfortune of others.
   We test this conjecture using data on US economic sanctions and global
   flows of US FDI from 1966 to 2000. The findings reveal that investor
   decision making in part responds to political developments beyond the
   home-host dyad.

AB We apply insights from new, new trade theory to explain a puzzling
   decline in US firm antidumping (AD) filings in an era of persistent
   foreign currency undervaluations and increasing import competition.
   Firms exhibit heterogeneity both within and across industries regarding
   foreign direct investment (FDI). We propose that firms making vertical
   or resource-seeking investments abroad will be less likely to file AD
   petitions, and firms are likely to undertake vertical FDI in the context
   of currency undervaluation. Hence, we argue, the increasing vertical FDI
   of US firms makes trade disputes far less likely. We use firm-level data
   to examine the universe of US manufacturing firms and find that AD
   filers generally conduct no intrafirm trade with filed-against
   countries. We also find that persistent currency undervaluation is
   associated over time with increased vertical FDI and intrafirm trade by
   US multinational corporations (MNCs) in the undervaluing country. Among
   larger US MNCs, the likelihood of an AD filing is negatively associated
   with increases in intrafirm trade. In the context of currency
   undervaluation, we confirm the existing finding that undervaluation is
   associated with more AD filings. We also find, however, that high levels
   of intrafirm imports from countries with undervalued currencies
   significantly decrease the likelihood of AD filings. Our study
   highlights the centrality of firm heterogeneity in international trade
   and investment in understanding political mobilization over
   international economic policy.

AB Selection effects in crisis bargaining make it difficult to directly
   measure audience costs because state leaders have an incentive to avoid
   incurring audience costs. We overcome this inferential problem of
   selection bias by using a structural statistical model. This approach
   allows us to estimate the size of audience costs, both incurred and not
   incurred, in international crises. We show that although audience costs
   exist for state leaders of various regime types, democratic leaders face
   larger audience costs than nondemocratic leaders do. Audience costs can
   be so large that war might be preferable to concessions, especially for
   leaders of highly democratic states. Audience costs also increase a
   state's bargaining leverage in crises because the target state is more
   likely to acquiesce if the challenge carries larger audience costs. We
   also find evidence that audience costs generate selection effects.

   determining combat eligibility in the Israel Defense Forces to examine
   the effect of combat exposure on support for peaceful conflict
   resolution. Given the centrality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to
   global affairs, and its apparent intractability, the political
   consequences of combat become all the more pressing. We find that
   exposure to combat hardens attitudes toward the rival and reduces
   support for negotiation and compromise. Importantly, these attitudes
   translate into voting behavior: combatants are likely to vote for more
   hawkish parties. These findings call for caution in emphasizing the
   benign effects of combat and underscore the importance of reintegrating

AB While existing research has documented persistent barriers facing
   African-American job seekers, far less research has questioned how job
   seekers respond to this reality. Do minorities self-select into
   particular segments of the labor market to avoid discrimination? Such
   questions have remained unanswered due to the lack of data available on
   the positions to which job seekers apply. Drawing on two original data
   sets with application-specific information, we find little evidence that
   blacks target or avoid particular job types. Rather, blacks cast a wider
   net in their search than similarly situated whites, including a greater
   range of occupational categories and characteristics in their pool of
   job applications. Additionally, we show that perceptions of
   discrimination are associated with increased search breadth, suggesting
   that broad search among African-Americans represents an adaptation to
   labor market discrimination. Together these findings provide novel
   evidence on the role of race and self-selection in the job search
   process.

   (allowing segregation patterns and processes to be studied at any

   isolated in 1880 given their small share of the total population and
   that segregation reached high levels in both cities earlier than
   previously reported. Regarding sources of racial separation, neither
   higher class standing nor northern birth had much effect on whether

AB The authors propose a strategy for observing and explaining workplace
   variance in categorically linked inequalities. Using Swedish
   economy-wide linked employer-employee panel data, the authors examine
   variation in workplace wage inequalities between native Swedes and
   non-Western immigrants. Consistent with relational inequality theory,
   the authors' findings are that immigrant-native wage gaps vary
   dramatically across workplaces, even net of strong human capital
   controls. The authors also find that, net of observed and fixed-effect
   controls for individual traits, workplace immigrant-native wage gaps
   decline with increased workplace immigrant employment and managerial
   representation and increase when job segregation rises. These results
   are stronger in high-inequality workplaces and for white-collar
   employees: contexts in which one expects status-based claims on
   organizational resources, the central causal mechanism identified by
   relational inequality theory, to be stronger. The authors conclude that
   workplace variation in the non-Western immigrant-native wage gaps is
   contingenton organizational variation in the relative power of groups
   and the institutional context in which that power is exercised.

   folding-the network property of a cohesive group whose membership

   effects of structural folding on game changing success are especially
   strong when overlapping groups are cognitively distant. Measuring social
   distance separately from cognitive distance and distinctiveness
   independently from critical acclaim, the authors test their hypothesis
   about structural folding and cognitive diversity by analyzing team
   reassembly for 12,422 video games and the career histories of 139,727
   video game developers. When combined with cognitive distance, structural
   folding channels and mobilizes a productive tension of rules, roles, and

   exits, distinguishing between the entrance of a biological father and a
   social father and testing for interactions between family structure
   instability and children's age, gender, and genetic characteristics.
   Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study and
   focusing on changes in family structure by age (years 0-9), the authors
   show that father exits are associated with increases in children's
   antisocial behavior, a strong predictor of health and well-being in
   adulthood. The pattern for father entrances is more complicated, with
   entrances for the biological father being associated with lower
   antisocial behavior among boys and social father entrances being
   associated with higher antisocial behavior. Child's age does not
   moderate the association; however, genetic information in the models
   sharpens the findings substantially.
