TI Do Voter Registration Drives Increase Participation? For Whom and When?

AB Most people interested in participating in the electoral process are
   registered to vote. This self-selection process creates two empirical
   puzzles. First, it is unclear whether voter registration drives
   introduce new voters into the electorate or simply facilitate a
   bureaucratic transaction that people registering would accomplish via
   other means in the absence of the drive. Second, estimating the causal
   effect of registration on turnout is difficult because the act of
   selection signals political interest and engagement that is correlated
   with turnout. This article utilizes field experiments to answer these
   two questions and the second question of the type of person mobilized by
   registration drives. 1 Across six cities, 620 streets were randomly
   assigned to receive face-to-face visits encouraging voter registration
   or a control group that received no attention from the campaign. On
   average, 10 more newly registered people appeared on treatment streets
   than control streets-an increase of 4.4%. This suggests that
   registration is a burden for a portion of the eligible population.
   Comparing the number of ballots cast by newly registered voters,
   treatment streets averaged two more votes than control streets. That is,
   24% of the people registered as a direct result of the experiment voted.
   Disaggregating the results by socioeconomic status, the increase in
   registration is largest on relatively poor streets, but this difference
   is counterbalanced by higher turnout among new registrants on relatively
   affluent streets. Thus, the results of these six experiments suggest
   that electoral reforms reducing the costs associated with voter
   registration will assist a nontrivial portion of the electorate but not
   alter the overall composition of the electorate.

   global instability as well as shedding light on what the future of
   economic development may hold. They do so by deconstructing the models
   of economic development that have implicitly and explicitly informed our
   theoretical frameworks, They represent important advances in historical
   research not only for the empirical correctives they offer, but because
   in deconstructing historical models, they in fact undermine the very
   idea of a model, instead introducing dynamic processes with
   indeterminate outcomes. The result is a reading of the history of
   economic development that offers new opportunities for scholarship and

AB We introduce methods for estimating nonparametric, nonadditive models
   with simultaneity. The methods are developed by directly connecting the
   elements of the structural system to be estimated with features of the
   density of the observable variables, such as ratios of derivatives or
   averages of products of derivatives of this density. The estimators are
   therefore easily computed functionals of a nonparametric estimator of
   the density of the observable variables. We consider in detail a model
   where to each structural equation there corresponds an exclusive
   regressor and a model with one equation of interest and one instrument
   that is included in a second equation. For both models, we provide new
   characterizations of observational equivalence on a set, in terms of the
   density of the observable variables and derivatives of the structural
   functions. Based on those characterizations, we develop two estimation
   methods. In the first method, the estimators of the structural
   derivatives are calculated by a simple matrix inversion and matrix
   multiplication, analogous to a standard least squares estimator, but
   with the elements of the matrices being averages of products of
   derivatives of nonparametric density estimators. In the second method,
   the estimators of the structural derivatives are calculated in two
   steps. In a first step, values of the instrument are found at which the
   density of the observable variables satisfies some properties. In the
   second step, the estimators are calculated directly from the values of
   derivatives of the density of the observable variables evaluated at the
   found values of the instrument. We show that both pointwise estimators
   are consistent and asymptotically normal.

AB This study provides causal evidence that a shock to the relative supply
   of inputs to production can (1) affect the direction of technological
   progress and (2) lead to a rebound in the relative price of the input
   that became relatively more abundant (the strong induced-bias
   hypothesis). I exploit the impact of the U.S. Civil War on the British
   cotton textile industry, which reduced supplies of cotton from the
   Southern United States, forcing British producers to shift to
   lower-quality Indian cotton. Using detailed new data, I show that this
   shift induced the development of new technologies that augmented Indian
   cotton. As these new technologies became available, I show that the
   relative price of Indian/U.S. cotton rebounded to its pre-war level,
   despite the increased relative supply of Indian cotton. This is the
   first paper to establish both of these patterns empirically, lending
   support to the two key predictions of leading directed technical change
   theories.

AB Are there times when durable spending is less responsive to economic
   stimulus? We argue that aggregate durable expenditures respond more
   sluggishly to economic shocks during recessions because microeconomic
   frictions lead to declines in the frequency of households' durable
   adjustment. We show this by first using indirect inference to estimate a
   heterogeneous agent incomplete markets model with fixed costs of durable
   adjustment to match consumption dynamics in PSID microdata. We then show
   that aggregating this model delivers an extremely procyclical Impulse
   Response Function (IRF) of durable spending to aggregate shocks. For
   example, the response of durable spending to an income shock in 1999 is
   estimated to be almost twice as large as if it occurred in 2009. This
   procyclical IRF holds in response to standard business cycle shocks as
   well as in response to various policy shocks, and it is robust to
   general equilibrium. After estimating this robust theoretical
   implication of micro frictions, we provide additional direct empirical
   evidence for its importance using both cross-sectional and time-series
   data.

   favourite-longshot bias (FLB): securities with a low-pay-out probability
   are overpriced, whereas securities with high probability pay-out are
   underpriced. We apply demand estimation techniques to betting market
   data, and find that the observed FLB is explained by a two-type
   population consisting of canonical traders, who hold virtually correct
   beliefs and are the majority type in the population (70%); and noise
   traders exhibiting significant belief dispersion. Furthermore,
   exploiting variation in public information across markets in our data

   find that intra-bloc trade increases by 118% for Mexico, 11% for Canada,

   We present results from a series of large-scale field experiments done
   at eBay that were designed to measure the causal effectiveness of paid
   search ads. Because search clicks and purchase intent are correlated, we
   show that returns from paid search are a fraction of non-experimental
   estimates. As an extreme case, we show that brand keyword ads have no
   measurable short-term benefits. For non-brand keywords, we find that new
   and infrequent users are positively influenced by ads but that more
   frequent users whose purchasing behavior is not influenced by ads
   account for most of the advertising expenses, resulting in average

AB Politics must address multiple problems simultaneously. In an ideal
   world, political competition would force parties to adopt priorities
   that reflect the voters' true concerns. In reality, parties can run
   their campaigns in such a way as to manipulate voters' priorities. This
   phenomenon, known as priming, may allow parties to underinvest in
   solving the issues that they intend to mute. We develop a model of
   endogenous issue ownership in which two vote-seeking parties (a) invest
   in policy quality to increase the value of their platform and (b) choose
   a communication strategy to prime voters. We identify novel feedback
   between communication and investment. In particular, we find that
   stronger priming effects can constrain parties to invest more resources
   in all issues. We also identify the conditions under which parties
   prefer to focus on their historical issues or to engage in issue
   stealing.

AB Bureaucratic compliance is often crucial for political survival, yet
   eliciting that compliance in weakly institutionalized environments
   requires that political principals convince agents that their hold on
   power is secure. We provide a formal model to show that electoral
   manipulation can help to solve this agency problem. By influencing
   beliefs about a ruler's hold on power, manipulation can encourage a
   bureaucrat to work on behalf of the ruler when he would not otherwise do
   so. This result holds under various common technologies of electoral
   manipulation. Manipulation is more likely when the bureaucrat is
   dependent on the ruler for his career and when the probability is high
   that even generally unsupportive citizens would reward bureaucratic
   effort. The relationship between the ruler's expected popularity and the
   likelihood of manipulation, in turn, depends on the technology of
   manipulation.

AB When do government policies induce responsive political participation?
   This study tests two hypotheses in the context of military draft
   policies. First, policy-induced risk motivates political participation.
   Second, contextual-level moderators, such as local events that make risk
   particularly salient, may intensify the effect of risk on participation.
   I use the random assignment of induction priority in the Vietnam draft
   lotteries to measure the effect of a son's draft risk on the voter
   turnout of his parents in the 1972 presidential election. I find higher
   rates of turnout among parents of men with losing draft lottery numbers.
   Among parents from towns with at least one prior war casualty, I find a
   7 to 9 percentage point effect of a son's draft risk on his parents'
   turnout. The local casualty contextual-level moderator is theorized to
   operate through the mechanism of an availability heuristic, whereby
   parents from towns with casualties could more readily imagine the
   adverse consequences of draft risk.

   disseminate such numerical indicators widely and instantly constitutes
   an exercise of social power, with the potential to change important
   policy outputs. It explores this argument in the context of the United
   States' efforts to combat trafficking in persons and find evidence that
   monitoring has important effects: Countries are more likely to
   criminalize human trafficking when they are included in the U.S. annual
   Trafficking in Persons Report, and countries that are placed on a watch
   list are also more likely to criminalize. These findings have broad

AB Unelected officials with coercive powers (e.g., police, prosecutors,
   bureaucrats) vary markedly in the extent to which citizens view their
   actions as legitimate. We explore the institutional determinants of
   legitimate authority in the context of a public goods laboratory
   experiment. In the experiment, an authority can target one citizen for
   punishment following citizen contribution choices. Untargeted citizens
   can then choose to help or hinder the authority. This latter choice may
   be interpreted as a behavioral measure of the authority's legitimacy. We
   find that legitimacy is affected by how authorities are compensated, the
   transparency with which their decisions are observed, and an interaction
   between these. When transparency is high, citizens are more willing to
   assist authorities who receive fixed salaries than those who personally
   benefit from collected penalties, even when citizens' material
   incentives are controlled for. Lower transparency reduces support, but
   only for salaried enforcers.

   Emerging democracies can use the 'sovereignty costs' associated with
   membership to lock in liberal policies and signal their intent to
   consolidate democracy. It also argues, however, that the magnitude of
   these costs varies across different human rights institutions, which
   include both treaties and international organizations. Consistent with

   While there is consensus that democracy is not generally associated with

   democracy bring growth if being one does not? This article shows that a
   substantial and immediate influx of foreign aid into new democracies
   accounts for the positive growth effect of democratization. The domestic
   regime characteristics of neither democracy nor democratization
   therefore seems to bring growth. The importance of aid in explaining the

   employs additional tests to supplement the regression analysis in order

AB Debates about decentralization raise cultural questions of identity and
   economic questions of redistribution and efficiency. Therefore the
   preferences of statewide parties regarding decentralization are related
   to their positions on the economic and cultural ideological dimensions.
   A statistical analysis using data from thirty-one countries confirms
   this: parties on the economic right are more supportive of
   decentralization than parties on the economic left, while culturally
   liberal parties favour decentralization more than culturally
   conservative parties. However, country context - specifically the degree
   of regional self-rule, the extent of regional economic disparity and the
   ideology of regionalist parties - determines whether and how
   decentralization is linked to the two dimensions. These findings have
   implications for our understanding of the politics of decentralization
   by showing how ideology, rooted in a specific country context, shapes
   the 'mindset' of agents responsible for determining the territorial
   distribution of power.

   about the strength and policy positions of factions inside Italian

   analysis of motions presented during party congresses. The results show
   that office, policy and electoral motives influence factions' decisions

   institutionalize patronage at the subnational level. Second,
   decentralized patronage systems are more resistant to reform than
   centralized ones. Case studies of India and Ceylon illustrate how
   variation in centrifugal pressures allowed subnational elites to capture
   the state in the former but not the latter. Further data from the
   British Empire shows that greater centrifugal pressures faced by British

AB According to what has recently been labeled 'political realism' in
   political theory, 'political moralists' such as Rawls and Dworkin
   misconstrue the political domain by presuming that morality has priority
   over politics, thus overlooking that the political is an autonomous
   domain with its own distinctive conditions and normative sources.
   Political realists argue that this presumption, commonly referred to as
   the 'ethics first premise', has to be abandoned in order to properly
   theorize a normative conception of political legitimacy. This article
   critically examines two features of political realism, which so far have
   received too little systematic philosophical analysis: the political
   realist critique of political moralism and the challenges facing
   political realism in its attempt to offer an alternative account of
   political legitimacy. Two theses are defended. First, to the extent that
   proponents of political realism wish to hold onto a normative conception
   of political legitimacy, refuting wholesale the ethics first premise
   leads to a deadlock, since it throws the baby out with the bathwater by
   closing the normative space upon which their account of political
   legitimacy relies. This is called the 'necessity thesis': all coherent
   and plausible conceptions of political legitimacy must hold onto the
   ethics first premise. Secondly, accepting this premise - and thus
   defending an ethics first view - does not entail that the political
   domain must be seen as a subordinate arena for the application of moral
   principles, that political normativity is reduced to morality or that
   morality trumps other reasons in political decision making, as claimed
   by political realists. Rather, the ethics first view is compatible with
   an autonomous political domain that makes room for an account of
   political legitimacy that is defined by and substantiated from sources
   of normativity specifically within the political. This is called the
   'compatibility thesis'.

AB The scope of the current European crisis calls for a rereading of
   mainstream economic theory. Europe is experiencing a "deja vu" history
   through which Latin America has already lived. The recurrent crises from
   the 1970s up to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy are manifestations of the
   financialization process and relate to its different facets. The
   objective of this article is to analyze financialization in the current
   economic and financial crisis in Europe as well as its role in the Latin
   American debt crisis. A heterodox perspective is necessary to understand
   this long process of economic deterioration and discern the global
   fragility of the current financial system. An explanation of the
   structural crisis in the Eurozone implies an understanding of the
   financial and monetary agreements laid out in the Maastricht Treaty and
   the position of the Central Bank with regard to financial markets.
   Today, financial investors have been especially attuned to interest rate
   risks and profitability in the international financial system, in the
   same way that transnational banks owned Latin American sovereign debt
   years before.

AB We investigate whether private research investments are distorted away
   from long-term projects. Our theoretical model highlights two potential
   sources of this distortion: short-termism and the fixed patent term. Our
   empirical context is cancer research, where clinical trials--and hence,
   project durations--are shorter for late-stage cancer treatments relative
   to early-stage treatments or cancer prevention. Using newly constructed
   data, we document several sources of evidence that together show private
   research investments are distorted away from long-term projects. The
   value of life-years at stake appears large. We analyze three potential
   policy responses: surrogate (non-mortality) clinical-trial endpoints,
   targeted R&D subsidies,and patent design.
