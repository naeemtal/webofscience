AB Recent research on economic voting has moved beyond the traditional
   reward-punishment hypothesis, according to which the economy is merely
   considered a valence issue. Instead, patrimonial economic voting
   research looks at voters as property owners within the economic system.
   These studies have relied on survey items that measure whether
   individuals own different kinds of property to test the patrimonial
   dimension. This study emphasizes the importance of a surprisingly
   neglected aspect: the value of assets. It uses official register data
   files from the Swedish Tax Agency on the value of individuals' assets
   merged with survey data from the 2006 Swedish National Election Study.
   The study finds that the relationship between patrimony and voting
   behavior in Sweden is similar to that found in other countries, but only
   when it is tested in a similar way as in these studies - that is, only
   when it is coded as whether voters own different assets. This study
   brings three important contributions to the debate. First, it offers a
   new empirically based categorization of the dimensionality of asset
   ownership and shows that the previous distinction between low- and
   high-risk assets is insufficient. Secondly, it shows that merely having
   assets or not, which is what previous studies have measured, is not what
   primarily matters; the relevant factor is the value of the assets. And
   thirdly, it demonstrates that only the value of some kinds of assets
   matters (especially stocks and real estate properties), while other
   assets (savings in bonds and funds) do not affect voting behavior or
   political opinions.

AB Compulsory voting is often linked to pro-democracy orientations in the
   public. However, there is reason to question the strength and
   universality of this link. Engaging research on the effects of coercion
   and punishment, this article argues that forced participation inflates
   the tendency of those with negative orientations towards democracy to
   see the democratic system as illegitimate, and to be dissatisfied with
   democracy. The study finds support for these expectations in analyses of
   three separate cross-national surveys and a natural experiment.
   Compulsory voting heightens dissatisfaction with democracy within key
   segments of the population.

AB Following mid-twentieth century predictions of Malthusian catastrophe,
   fertility in the developing world more than halved, while living
   standards more than doubled. We analyze how fertility change related to
   economic growth during this episode, using data on 2.3 million women
   from 25.5 household surveys. We find different responses to fluctuations
   and long-run growth, both heterogeneous over the life cycle. Fertility
   was procyclical but declined and delayed with long-run growth;
   fluctuations late (but not early) in the reproductive period affected
   lifetime fertility. The results are consistent with models of the escape
   from the Malthusian trap, extended with a life cycle and liquidity
   constraints.

AB This Presidential Address offers elements for a systematic and
   cumulative study of destigmatization, or the process by which low-status
   groups gain recognition and worth. Contemporary sociologists tend to
   focus on inequality in the distribution of resources, such as
   occupations, education, and wealth. Complementing this research, this
   address draws attention to "recognition gaps," defined as disparities in
   worth and cultural membership between groups in a society. I first
   describe how neoliberalism promotes growing recognition gaps. Then,
   drawing on research on stigmatized groups across several societies, I
   analyze how experiences of stigma and destigmatization are enabled and
   constrained by various contextual factors and actors, including
   institutions, cultural repertoires, knowledge workers, and social
   movement activists. I conclude by proposing a research agenda for the
   sociology of recognition and destigmatization, and by sketching how
   social scientists, policymakers, organizations, and citizens can
   contribute to the reduction of recognition gaps.

AB Historic increases in income inequality have coincided with widening
   class divides in parental investments of money and time in children.
   These widening class gaps are significant because parental investment is
   one pathway by which advantage is transmitted across generations. Using
   over three decades of micro-data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey
   and the American Heritage Time Use Survey linked to state-year measures
   of income inequality, we test the relationship between income inequality
   and class gaps in parental investment. We find robust evidence of wider
   class gaps in parental financial investments in childrenbut not parental
   time investments in childrenwhen state-level income inequality is
   higher. We explore mechanisms that may drive the relationship between
   rising income inequality and widening class gaps in parental financial
   investments in children. This relationship is partially explained by the
   increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution
   in state-years with higher inequality, which gives higher-earning
   households more money to spend on financial investments in children. In
   addition, we find evidence for contextual effects of higher income
   inequality that reshape parental preferences toward financial investment
   in children differentially by class.

AB Scholars of comparative family policy research have raised concerns
   about potential negative outcomes of generous family policies, an issue
   known as the "welfare state paradox." They suspect that such policies
   will make employers reluctant to hire or promote women into
   high-authority jobs, because women are more likely than men to use those
   policies and take time off. Few studies, however, have directly tested
   this employer-side mechanism. In this article, we argue that due to
   employer heterogeneity, as well as different modes of policy
   intervention such as mandate-based and incentive-based approaches,
   generous family policies may not always lead to employer discrimination.
   Adopting a quasi-experimental research design that classifies employers
   based on their differential receptivity to family policy changes, we
   compare their hiring and promotion of women before and after two major
   family policy reforms in Japan, one in 1992 and another in 2005. Our
   analysis using panel data of large Japanese firms finds little evidence
   of policy-induced discrimination against women. Instead, we find that
   employers who voluntarily provided generous leave benefits prior to
   government mandates or incentives actually hired and promoted more women
   after the legal changes, and employers who provided generous benefits in
   response to government incentives also increased opportunities for
   women.

   empirically investigate the conditions under which somethingcall it Xis

   process. What must X be like? What doesn't count (besides, presumably,
   myotatic reflexes and blushing)? Whom or what must X be done by? What
   can't be a decision-maker (besides, presumably, rocks and apples)?
   Second, empirically investigate how decision/choice concepts are used in
   everyday life, politics, business, education, law, technology, and
   science. What are they used for? To what extent do people understand and
   represent themselves and others as decision-makers? Where do
   decision-centric or decisionist understandings succeed? These aren't
   armchair, theoretical, philosophical questions, but empirical ones.
   Decision/choice concepts' apparent ubiquity in contemporary societies
   calls for a well-thought-out research program on their social life and

AB Thirty-five years ago, Gillian Rose articulated a significant critique
   of classical sociological reason, emphasizing its relationship to its
   philosophical forebears. In a series of works, but most significantly in
   her Hegel contra Sociology, Rose worked to specify the implications of
   sociology's failure, both in its critical Marxist and its scientific'
   forms, to move beyond Kant and to fully come to terms with the thought
   of Hegel. In this article, I unpack and explain the substance of her
   criticisms, developing the necessary Hegelian philosophical background
   on which she founded them. I argue that Rose's attempted recuperation of
   speculative reason' for social theory remains little understood, despite
   its continued relevance to contemporary debates concerning the nature
   and scope of sociological reason. As an illustration, I employ Rose to
   critique Chernilo's recent call for a more philosophically sophisticated
   sociology. From the vantage point of Rose, this particular account of a
   philosophical sociology' remains abstract and rooted in the neo-Kantian
   contradictions that continue to characterize sociology.

AB This paper offers a defence of sociology through an engagement with
   Actor Network Theory (ANT) and particularly the critique of critical'
   and politically engaged social science developed by Bruno Latour. It
   argues that ANT identifies some weaknesses in more conventional
   sociology and social theory, and suggests that critical' and public'
   orientated sociologists can learn from the analytical precision and
   ethnographic sensibilities that characterize ANT as a framework of
   analysis and a research programme. It argues, however, that Latour et
   al. have too hastily dispensed with critique' in favour of a value
   neutral descriptive sociology, and that the symmetrical and
   horizontalist approach adopted in ANT is particularly ill-suited to the
   development of scientific knowledge about social structures. It argues
   that a more straightforwardly realist sociology would share many of the
   strengths of ANT whilst being better able to interrogate, empirically
   and normatively, the centres of contemporary social power.

AB Our sense of belonging rarely stands still, yet the research literature
   has hitherto paid little attention to the temporal nature of belonging.
   Based on an analysis of 62 Mass Observation Project (MOP) accounts
   written by people living in the UK aged from their 20s to their 90s,
   this paper argues that as people age, how they locate belonging in time
   shifts. This has to do with changing concerns related to belonging, but
   also to metaphysical issues of temporality and mortality, namely how
   people experience their own finite lifetime. The paper thus offers an
   illustrative example of how time can be empirically researched in
   sociology, with a particular focus on the important role that the future
   plays in how people construct their functional present' (Mead ). The
   central argument put forward is that time itself can be an important
   source of belonging, but one that is unequally accessible to people of
   different ages because of contemporary cultural scripts that present
   life as a linear progression into the future and construct the future as
   a more meaningful temporal horizon than the past.

AB This article draws upon responses given by volunteers who work in the
   Beijing LGBT Centre regarding perceptions of sexual identity, and how
   Chinese culture affects hidden or open sexual identities of Chinese
   lesbian and gay people in this region. The insights gained from those
   working carefully to create social change offers an important and
   original contribution to the field of gay and lesbian studies in China.
   The findings indicate the volunteers at the Beijing LGBT Centre are
   frustrated by the lack of acceptance of non-heterosexual relationships
   among Chinese culture and society, and by the disregard of lesbian gay
   and bisexual (LGB) people by the Chinese government. The findings also
   illustrate stigmatization of homosexuality in China is enacted in
   structural terms (such as in the lack of policy, legislation and
   positive endorsement by governmental and socio-political organizations),
   public expression (such as negative attitudes, beliefs or reactions
   towards LGB people) and internalized repression (through fear of
   stigmatization, and subsequent abuse due to negative societal attitudes
   and discrimination). Influenced by the Chinese tradition of conforming
   to group values, the findings from this study show that volunteers at
   the Beijing LGBT Centre believe LGB people in China are generally
   hesitant to disclose their sexual identities, and reject the idea that
   there had been a collective shift in Chinese culture regarding increased
   acceptance of LGB people. It also finds volunteers at the LGBT Centre in
   Beijing blame Chinese culture for its lack of acceptance of
   non-heterosexual relationships, and state stigmatization of
   homosexuality in China is due to deep-rooted cultural homophobia.

AB Much of the literature on the urban middle classes describes processes
   of both affiliation (often to the localities) and disaffiliation (often
   from some of the non-middle-class residents). In this paper, we consider
   this situation from a different position, drawing on research exploring
   whether and how children and adults living in diverse localities develop
   friendships with those different to themselves in terms of social class
   and ethnicity. This paper focuses on the interviews with the ethnically
   diverse, but predominantly white British, middle-class parent
   participants, considering their attitudes towards social and cultural
   difference. We emphasize the importance of highlighting inequalities
   that arise from social class and its intersection with ethnicity in
   analyses of complex urban populations. The paper's contribution is,
   first, to examine processes of clustering amongst the white British
   middle-class parents, particularly in relation to social class. Second,
   we contrast this process, and its moments of reflection and unease, with
   the more deliberate and purposeful efforts of one middle-class,
   Bangladeshi-origin mother who engages in active labour to facilitate

AB This article develops a situational approach to understanding urban
   public life and, in particular, the production of urban territories. Our
   aim is to examine the ways in which city space might be understood as
   comprising multiple, shifting, mobile and rhythmed territories. We argue
   that such territories are best understood through attending to their
   everyday production and negotiation, rather than handling territory as
   an a priori construct. We develop this argument from the particular case
   of the street-level politics of homelessness and street care. The
   experience of street homelessness and the provision of care in the
   public spaces of the city is characterised by precarious territorial
   claims made and lost. We describe some of the ways in which care work
   with rough sleepers is itself precarious; homeless', in lacking a
   distinct setting in which it might get done. Indeed, outreach work takes
   place within and affirms homeless territories. The affirmation of
   territory is shown to be central to the relationship developed between
   the workers and their rough sleeping clients. We also show, however, the
   ways in which outreach workers operate on territory not their own, twice
   over. Outreach work is precarious in that it is practised within, and
   can run counter to, other territorial productions in which the
   experience of urban need and the work and politics of care are
   entangled. In sum, this article aims to move beyond static and binary
   understandings by developing a mobile and situational approach to city
   space which recognises the intensive yet overlooked work of territorial
   production.

AB Mainstream conceptualizations of ethical consumption' equate the notion
   with conscious, individual, market-mediated choices motivated by ethical
   or political aims that transcend ordinary concerns. Drawing on recent
   sociology and anthropology of consumption literature on the links
   between ordinary ethics and ethical consumption, this article discusses
   some of the limitations of this conceptualization. Using data from 32
   focus groups conducted in Chile and Brazil, we propose a
   conceptualization of ethical consumption that does not centre on
   individual, market-mediated choices but understands it at the level of
   practical outcomes, which we refer to as different forms of ethical
   living'. To do that, we argue, we need to depart from the deontological
   understanding of ethics that underpins mainstream approaches to ethical
   consumption and adopt a more consequentialist view focusing on ethical
   outcomes. We develop these points through describing one particular
   ordinary moral regime that seemed to be predominant in participants'
   accounts of ethics and consumption in both Chile and Brazil: one that
   links consumption and ethics through care. We show that the moral regime
   of care leads to ethical outcomes', such as energy saving or limiting
   overconsumption, yet contrary to the mainstream view of ethical
   consumption emphasizing politicized choice expressed through markets,
   these result from following ordinary ethics, often through routines of
   practices.

AB Economists and sociologists of religion have claimed that religious
   establishment dampens religious vitality, leading to lower recruitment
   efforts, low attendance, declining membership within established
   congregations, and the crowding out' of non-established congregations.
   Conversely, these authors have told us, disestablishment will lead to
   more religious vitality. Remarkably, even though these claims rest on
   the connection between establishment and the organizational and
   membership behaviour of local religious congregations, no research has
   directly examined that connection. We use the 2008 Swiss National
   Congregations Study as well as historical data to assess the effect of
   different levels of religious establishment on both established and
   non-established congregations. We find that established congregations do
   indeed show less religious vitality than non-established congregations.
   Contrary to the claims of the economic literature, however, these
   covariations are not caused by differences in religious establishment on
   the cantonal level. Both our quantitative and historical analyses show
   that disestablishment has not led to religious vitality for either
   established or non-established congregations. The only clear effect of
   disestablishment is a dramatic decrease of income for established
   congregations. Based on quantitative and historical evidence, we suggest
   that differences between established and non-established congregations
   are produced by differences in religious tradition and immigration
   flows, not by differences in levels of establishment.

   be argued that integration and the production of difference are
   intertwined, entangled dualities, and far from being a benign
   entanglement, this duality is premised on the force and reach of
   everyday civic racisms. Of pivotal and unique analytical significance
   here is the observation that racism should not only be considered an

AB Changing labour conditions in the creative industries - with
   celebrations of autonomy and entrepreneurialism intertwined with
   increasing job insecurity, portfolio careers and short-term,
   project-based contracts - are often interpreted as heralding changes to
   employment relations more broadly. The position of musicians' labour in
   relation to these changes is unclear, however, given that these kinds of
   conditions have defined musicians' working practices over much longer
   periods of time (though they may have intensified due to well-documented
   changes to the music industry brought about by digitization and
   disintermediation). Musicians may thus be something of a barometer of
   current trends, as implied in the way that the musically derived label
   gig economy' is being used to describe the spread of precarious working
   conditions to broader sections of the population. This article, drawing
   on original qualitative research that investigated the working practices
   of musicians, explores one specific aspect of these conditions: whether
   musicians are self-consciously entrepreneurial towards their work and
   audience. We found that, while the musicians in our study are routinely
   involved in activities that could be construed as entrepreneurial,
   generally they were reluctant to label themselves as entrepreneurs. In
   part this reflected understandings of entrepreneurialism as driven by
   profit-seeking but it also reflected awareness that being a popular
   musician has always involved business and commercial dimensions. Drawing
   on theoretical conceptions of entrepreneurship developed by Joseph
   Schumpeter we highlight how the figure of the entrepreneur and the
   artist/musician share much in common and reflect various aspects of
   romantic individualism. Despite this, there are also some notable
   differences and we conclude that framing musicians' labour as
   entrepreneurial misrepresents their activities through an overemphasis
   on the economic dimensions of their work at the expense of the cultural.

AB How do states resolve jurisdictional conflicts among international
   institutions? In many issue areas, global governance is increasingly
   fragmented among multiple international organizations (IOs). Existing
   work argues this fragmentation can undermine cooperation as different
   institutions adopt conflicting rules. However, this perspective
   overlooks the potential for interinstitutional coordination. I develop a
   theory of institutional deference: the acceptance of another IO's
   exercise of authority. By accepting rules crafted in another IO, member
   states can mitigate rule conflict and facilitate a division of labor
   within the regime complex. I use an original data set of over 2,000 IO
   policy documents to describe patterns of deference in the
   counterterrorism, intellectual property, and election-monitoring regime
   complexes. Empirical tests support two theoretical claims. First,
   institutional deference is indeed associated with a division of labor
   among institutions: IOs that defer to each other are more likely to
   focus their rule-making efforts on separate subissues. Second, deference
   is a strategic act that is shaped both by efficiency concerns and power
   politics. Statistical tests confirm that deference is used to
   efficiently pool resources among disparate organizations, and that IOs
   with weaker member states tend to defer to organizations with more
   powerful members.

AB Recent works on the role of argumentation in international politics have
   enriched our understanding of the discursive construction of
   international legitimacy. Many scholars have recognized the
   pervasiveness and privileged status of legal claims. Building on these
   insights, I advance the proposition that the international legitimacy of
   the use of force has legalized. Legalization implies that successful
   (de-)legitimation depends on the strategic use of international law, and
   that alternative legitimacy discourses (such as morality) have been
   marginalized and play a negligible role in the construction of
   legitimacy. Thus, the use of force is legitimate to the extent that it
   conforms to international law. I test this legalization thesis against
   the hard case of NATO's intervention in Kosovo in 1999. By revisiting
   the arguments used by state representatives, I show that, as expected in
   a legalized legitimacy system and contrary to what has become common
   knowledge about this case, legitimacy was gained through, not despite,
   international law. I analyze NATO's strategy of legitimation in detail
   and reconstruct it as a set of seven strategic moves, all of them
   appealing exclusively to the international legal discourse.

AB Technological change can increase the productivity of the various
   factors of production in equal terms, or it can be biased toward a
   specific factor. We directly assess the bias of technological change by
   measuring, at the level of the individual firm, how much of it is labor
   augmenting and how much is factor neutral. To do so, we develop a
   framework for estimating production functions when productivity is
   multidimensional. Using panel data from Spain, we find that
   technological change is biased, with both its labor-augmenting and its
   factor-neutral components causing output to grow by about 1.5 percent
   per year.

AB House prices exhibit substantially more momentum, positive
   autocorrelation in price changes, than existing theories can explain. I
   introduce an amplification mechanism to reconcile this discrepancy.
   Sellers do not set a unilaterally high or low list price because they
   face a concave demand curve: increasing the price of an
   above-average-priced house rapidly reduces its sale probability, but
   cutting the price of a below-average-priced house only slightly improves
   its sale probability. The resulting strategic complementarity amplifies
   frictions because sellers gradually adjust their price to stay near
   average. I provide empirical evidence for concave demand using a
   quantitative search model that amplifies momentum two- to threefold.

AB Inequality in family wealth is high, yet we know little about how much
   and how wealth inequality is maintained across generations. We argue
   that a long-term perspective reflective of wealth's cumulative nature is
   crucial to understand the extent and channels of wealth reproduction
   across generations. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
   that span nearly half a century, we show that a one-decile increase in
   parents' wealth position is associated with an increase of about four
   percentiles in their offspring's wealth position in adulthood. We show
   that grandparental wealth is a unique predictor of grandchildren's
   wealth, above and beyond the role of parental wealth, suggesting that a
   focus on only parent-child dyads understates the importance of family
   wealth lineages. Second, considering five channels of wealth
   transmission-gifts and bequests, education, marriage, homeownership, and
   business ownership-we find that most of the advantages arising from
   family wealth begin much earlier in the life course than the common
   focus on bequests implies, even when we consider the wealth of
   grandparents. We also document the stark disadvantage of African
   American households in terms of not only their wealth attainment but
   also their intergenerational wealth mobility compared to whites.

AB While maternal employment has become the norm in advanced industrial
   nations, gendered norms of parenting and employment disadvantage mothers
   in the labor force. This paper sheds new light on motherhood pay gaps by
   investigating the contribution of an understudied dynamic-mothers'
   overrepresentation in low-paying workplaces. Estimating between-and
   within-establishment wage gaps with nationally representative Canadian
   linked employer-employee data reveals that segregation in low-paying
   establishments accounts for the bulk of mothers' wage disadvantage
   relative to childless women. Pay gaps net of human capital differences
   are not chiefly a result of mothers' lower wages vis-a-vis similar women
   in a given workplace, but rather stem from the fact that mothers are
   disproportionately employed in workplaces that pay all employees
   relatively poorly. Having identified the importance of
   between-establishment segregation, additional analyses probe support for
   two theories about underlying mechanisms: compensating differentials
   tied to family-supportive work contexts, and discrimination. While each
   plays a role, evidence is strongest for discrimination, with
   organizational characteristics that tend to reduce opportunities for
   discrimination also dramatically reducing or eliminating motherhood pay
   gaps.

AB The recent expansion of for-profit colleges in US higher education has
   ignited much debate over the potential contributions, and limitations,
   of profit-maximizing educational businesses to socioeconomic inequality.
   For-profit colleges have a strong economic incentive to retain students,
   and can offer innovative services in order to compete with more
   established institutions. But for-profit colleges may also seek to
   increase revenues in ways that are not beneficial for student outcomes.
   Using detailed longitudinal information on a nationally representative
   sample of recent high school students (ELS 2002), this paper provides
   the first comprehensive and systematic assessment of the effect of
   attendance at for-profit colleges on socioeconomic inequality in student
   outcomes, measured as the attainment of bachelor's degrees. Results from
   logit models and weighted regression technique indicate that low-SES
   students that attend for-profit colleges are substantially less likely
   to earn a bachelor's degree than observationally similar students that
   attend non-profit open admission colleges. By contrast, enrollment at
   for-profit colleges has little bearing on the likelihood of high-SES
   students to earn a bachelor's degree. These findings suggest that
   for-profit colleges contribute to the maintenance of socioeconomic
   disadvantage, in that low-SES students with mobility aspirations are
   paying more for their education and yet are less likely to reap the
   benefits of their investment.

AB More than one-half of all people living with HIV are women and 80
   percent of all HIV-positive women in the world live in sub-Saharan
   Africa. This paper demonstrates that the legal origins of these formerly
   colonized countries significantly determine current-day female HIV
   rates. In particular, female HIV rates are significantly higher in
   common law sub-Saharan African countries compared to civil law ones.
   This paper explains this relationship by focusing on differences in
   female property rights under the two codes of law. In sub-Saharan
   Africa, common law is associated with weaker female marital property
   laws. As a result, women in these common law countries have lower
   bargaining power within the household and are less able to negotiate
   safe sex practices and are thus more vulnerable to HIV, compared to
   their civil law counterparts. Exploiting the fact that some ethnic
   groups in sub-Saharan Africa cross country borders with different legal
   systems, we are able to include ethnicity fixed effects into a
   regression discontinuity approach. This allows us to control for a large
   set of cultural, geographical, and environmental factors that could be
   confounding the estimates. The results of this paper are consistent with
   gender inequality (the "feminization" of AIDS), explaining much of its
   prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB I consider a model in which two states choose how much to arm and
   whether to attack in successive periods. Arms are useful not only for
   deterrence or taking territory, but also because they influence the
   resolution of a set of disputed issues. States can cooperate on the
   issues by limiting military competition, but only as far as an
   endogenous war constraint allows. Factors determining the tightness of
   the war constraint imply hypotheses about the international determinants
   of military effort and thus the costs of anarchy. The strategic logic
   differs from standard security-dilemma arguments, in which the costs of
   anarchy are associated with conflict between status quo states that are
   uncertain about others' territorial revisionism. Here, inefficiency
   arises because arming to deter lowers a state's value for living with
   the status quo, which creates a security externality and a feedback
   loop. The model both synthesizes and revises a range of theoretical
   arguments about the determinants of interstate cooperation and conflict.

   goods and performances. We provide evidence for our claims through a

   and practice-theoretic understanding of hierarchy and hegemony. We build
   on claims that world politics is a sphere of complex social

AB How does publicizing states' illicit activities affect the stability of
   international order? What does this relationship tell us about how
   governments react to violations of international rules? In contrast to
   the conventional wisdom that transparent monitoring strengthens the
   normative legal order, we argue that these activities often undermine
   it. We develop two mechanisms through which this occurs: by raising the
   known rate of noncompliance, and by sharpening the threat that deviance
   poses to other states. We argue that when enforcers understand the
   dangers of publicizing transgressions, they do so selectively. Focusing
   on the nuclear nonproliferation domain, we demonstrate that these
   concerns shaped American decisions to reveal or obfuscate other states'
   efforts to obtain nuclear weapons. We formalize this argument and then
   empirically test the model's predictions using in-depth case study
   analyses. We find that the US failed to disclose infractions when this
   publicity would have undermined the rules through the two mechanisms we
   identify. However, while concealing violations can prevent proliferation
   in response to specific nuclear programs, it can also create potential
   dangers to a regime's overall health and stability. In addition to
   reassessing a widely shared assumption about the value of transparent
   monitoring, this article's broad theoretical framework can shed light on
   enforcement and compliance dynamics in a variety of international
   settings.

   effect that election observers have on local attitudes about elections.
   We argue that the activities of election observers can enhance
   elections' local credibility, but only when locals perceive observers as
   being both capable of detecting fraud and unbiased in that pursuit. Not
   all observer groups are seen as equally capable and unbiased. Evidence
   from a large-scale, nationally representative experiment in Tunisia
   supports the argument. A key finding is that observers from the Arab

   election observationenhanced credibility the most because they were

AB Politicians frequently turn to reputational arguments to bolster support

   that domestic audiences care about reputation, there is very little
   direct evidence that publics care about reputation costs, and very
   little understanding of how. We propose a dispositional theory of
   reputation costs in which citizens facing ill-defined strategic
   situations turn to their core predispositions about foreign affairs in
   order to weigh competing reputational dimensions. Employing a diverse
   array of methodological toolsfrom vignette-based survey experiments to
   automated text analysiswe show that the mass public has a taste for
   reputation, but understands it in fundamentally different ways, with
   hawks concerned about the negative reputational consequences of
   inconsistency, and doves equally concerned with the negative
   reputational consequences of belligerence and interventionism. In
   illustrating how reputation costs are in our heads, our findings offer
   both good and bad news for theories of reputation in IR.

   causal effect of specific interventions. We compare two types of
   interventions: counter-speaking (informal verbal sanctions) and
   censoring (deleting hateful content). The interventions are based on the
   belief that individuals infer acceptability from the context, using
   previous actions as a source of normative information. The interventions
   are based on the two conceptualizations found in the literature: (i)
   what do others normally do, i.e. descriptive norms; and (ii) what
   happened to those who violated the norm, i.e. injunctive norms.
   Participants were significantly less likely to engage in hate speech
   when prior hate content had been moderately censored. Our results
   suggest that norm adherence in online conversations might, in fact, be
   motivated by descriptive norms rather than injunctive norms. With this
   work we present some of the first experimental evidence investigating
   the social determinants of hate speech in online communities. The
   results could advance the understanding of the micro-mechanisms that
   regulate hate speech. Also, such findings can guide future interventions
   in online communities that help prevent the spread of hate.

AB The concept of the social investment welfare state has received a lot of
   attention and support both from academics and policymakers. It is
   therefore commonly assumed that policies such as investing in education
   or family services would also receive significant support from themass
   public. While there are some indications of this, existing comparative
   surveys of public opinion usually do not take into account how citizens
   perceive and react to policy trade-offs, i.e. how they respond when
   forced to prioritize between different types of social policies, which
   is more realistic given budget constraints. This article presents
   original data from a representative survey of public opinion in eight
   Western European countries, studying how support for social investment
   policies changes when additional spending on these policies would have
   to be financed with cutbacks in other parts of the welfare state. The
   central findings are that citizens generally dislike being forced to cut
   back one type of social spending to expand another, but there is a
   significant degree of variation across individuals and policy fields.
   Material self-interest and ideological predispositions as well as their
   interaction help understanding differences in the acceptance of these
   trade-offs. The findings have important implications for the political
   viability of social investment policies. Political parties aiming to
   expand social investment in a context of fiscal austerity are confronted
   with different and distinct electoral constraints and challenges given
   the respective preferences of their electorates.

AB The wage weight penalty is a well-established finding in the literature,
   but not much is known about the mechanisms that bring this phenomenon
   about. This article aims to provide answers to the question of why
   overweight and obese people earn less. Using the data of the German
   Socio-Economic Panel, we conduct three theory-driven litmus tests for
   mechanisms that explain the weight wage gap: human capital differences,
   discrimination due to asymmetric information, or taste-based
   discrimination. Due to conflicting predictions from the three theories,
   interaction effects between weight and structural conditions serve as
   the key identification strategy. Results show that for men,
   productivityrelated variables (e. g. education, work experience,
   occupation, and physical health) almost completely explain the
   weight-specific variance in wages. In contrast, for women, neither
   performance nor a lack of information can solve the puzzle of
   weight-based differences in wages. We therefore conclude that-at least
   in Germany-overweight and obese women suffer from taste-based
   discrimination, whereas overweight and obese men earn less due to human
   capital differences.

AB Residential segregation along ethnic categories has been associated with
   social disadvantages of minority group members. It is considered a
   driving factor in the reproduction of social inequalities and a pressing
   issue in many societies. While most research focuses on neighbourhood
   segregation in the United States, less is known about the origins of
   ethnic enclaves in European cities. We use complete data of residential
   moves within Stockholm municipality between 1990 and 2003 to test
   whether `ethnic flight' or ` ethnic avoidance' drives segregation
   dynamics. On the macro level, we analyse the binary infrastructure of
   natives' and immigrants' movement flows between 128 neighbourhoods with
   exponential random graph models, which account for systemic dependencies
   in the structure of the housing market. On the micro level, we analyse
   individual-level panel data to account for differences between native
   and immigrant in-and out-movers. Our results show strong support for `
   ethnic avoidance' on both levels-native Swedes avoid moving into
   neighbourhoods where ethnic minorities live. This is even more
   pronounced when controlling for socio-economic factors. At the same
   time, there is only little support for ` ethnic flight' on the micro
   level-native Swedes are only marginally more likely to move out of
   neighbourhoods where many immigrants live.

AB In this research I assess within-group inequality-earnings inequality
   occurring among otherwise similar individuals based on observed
   characteristics-in a cross-national comparative perspective. While
   scholarly interest in the within-group portion of inequality has grown
   over the past 25 years, virtually all studies focus on the US case. The
   current research shifts focus by assessing within-group inequality in a
   cross-national comparative study. I do so by constructing a unique data
   set of country-level measures of within-and between-group inequality for
   annual market earnings using Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) microdata
   from 1.36 million full-time prime-age male and female workers nested in
   143 countryyears, drawn from 28 countries spanning 40 years. I then
   document and describe basic betweencountry and longitudinal trends in
   the relationship between total inequality and within-group inequality. I
   find that in nearly all countries in the LIS, within-group inequality is
   the primary driver of levels and trends in inequality. As inequality
   increases, so too does the relative importance of within-group
   inequality. However, substantial cross-national heterogeneity based in
   labour market institutions and employment protection legislation is
   found. Theoretical and substantive implications are discussed.

AB Scholars argue that the dual path to labour market flexibility protects
   the privileges of core workers at the expense of employees relegated to
   a peripheral employment sector. Yet whether core workers indeed benefit
   from workforce segmentation remains disputed. To scrutinize this
   question, I study how the wages of core workers with less than college
   education respond when their employer shifts employment out to
   subcontractors, using linked employer-employee panel data from Germany.
   Empirically, I find the effect of subcontracting on average to be either
   positive or neutral but not negative. The presence and strength of the
   positive effect depends (i) on whether the type of subcontracting
   affords core workers with co-determination rights, (ii) on whether core
   workers are represented by a works council to exercise these rights, and
   (iii) on whether these rights are exercised in a context that augments
   the bargaining position of core workers by rendering conflictual labour
   relations costly to the employer.

AB This article uses pupil's month of birth as a natural experiment to
   study how immigrant-native inequalities in retention rates are produced.
   We argue that, compared to native-born parents, immigrant parents face
   additional disadvantage when dealing with the age disadvantage of their
   children. We test this hypothesis using a regression discontinuity
   design with the French sample of the Programme for International Student
   Assessment. We find that pupils born before the cut-off date for
   entering primary school are 9 percentage points more likely to repeat a
   grade in primary school. In line with the double disadvantage
   hypothesis, the relative age effect is 10 percentage points higher for
   children with two immigrant parents, while we do not find a difference
   for children with one immigrant parent. However, the relative age effect
   is reduced to 4 percentage points when adjusting for the differential
   effect of parental resources, suggesting that part of the disadvantage
   is due to compositional differences in socio-economic background and
   part is immigrant-specific.

AB Millions of workers in the United States experience volatile weekly
   working hours and nonstandard shift work, particularly following the
   Great Recession. These aspects of work schedules bring greater economic
   insecurity and work-life conflict, particularly for low-wage workers. In
   the absence of strong and widespread policies regulating work hours in
   the United States, labor unions may significantly limit varying hours
   and nonstandard shifts. However, any benefits of union membership could
   depend on local unionization rates, which vary widely between states.
   This paper analyzes the relationship between union membership and
   varying weekly work hours and nonstandard schedules among hourly workers
   using data from the 2004-2007 and 2008-2012 Surveys of Income and
   Program Participation. The results show that union members were
   significantly less likely to report varying numbers of hours from week
   to week, particularly in states with relatively high unionization rates.
   In contrast, union members were more likely to report nonstandard
   schedules. The earnings penalties for varying hours and nonstandard
   schedules are significantly weaker among union members than non-members.
   Altogether, the results demonstrate some of unions' continued benefits
   for workers, and some of their limitations.

   We explore how micro-level ideological Islamic-secular polarization and
   macro-level state regulation as to female participation may impact the
   meso-level interaction among high school forms. We demonstrate that
   rival organizational forms affect each other's growth positively, on

   and reinforced by the increase in female participation in Islamic high

AB Collective action scholars have long examined why people choose to
   participate in social movements. This article argues that this body of
   scholarship can be productively applied to understanding rescue efforts
   during genocide, which have typically been associated with altruism and
   other psychological explanations. We analyze the case of Rwanda, where
   people worked collectively to save Tutsi from the violence that swept
   across the country in 1994, and ask: What social factors shaped
   Rwandans' decisions and abilities to save persecuted individuals? To
   address this question, we draw upon 35 in-depth interviews and a survey
   of 273 individuals who participated in rescue efforts, which constitutes
   one of the largest samples of rescue efforts to date. Although much
   previous literature has emphasized the role of stable personality traits
   in influencing such high-risk decisions, conceptualizing rescue as
   dynamic collective action enables us to examine social and contextual
   factors. Specifically, we illustrate how biographical availability,
   socialization, and situational contexts may influence rescue efforts.
   These findings contribute to scholarship on high-risk, clandestine
   collective action by illuminating how a combination of factors,
   including biographical availability, socialization, and situational
   contexts, coalesce to make rescue possible. As such, these findings
   inform our understanding of collective action that resulted in thousands
   of individuals being spared from torture, sexualized violence, and
   death.

AB It is well known that political elites can shape public attitudes toward
   policies and values. Less is known, however, about whether elites can
   also influence public perceptions of social groups they praise or
   denounce. I test this by analyzing the attitudinal effects of Donald
   Trump's 2016 presidential campaign announcement speech, in which he
   referred to Mexican immigrants as "rapists" and "criminals." First, to
   provide causal estimates, I analyze survey data using a counterfactual
   approach. I find evidence that Trump's statements negatively affected
   public opinion toward immigrants particularly among groups with
   restrictionist tendencies. Second, using a panel survey experiment, I
   corroborate this causal relationship but find that these effects are
   short-lived. This explains why restrictionist politicians like Trump
   constantly prod natives to keep their messages' effects from
   dissipating. I also find that only negative messages are consequential
   and find no evidence that elite statements are more impactful than those
   from non-elites, suggesting that the power of elite rhetoric lies
   primarily in its capacity to reach the masses via the news media.

AB This paper investigates the question of whether and how race and race
   relations affect state legislators' support for restrictive immigration
   policy. Focusing on the nine new immigration destinations in the US
   Southeast, we compare the roll call votes cast by African American and
   White Democratic state legislators on 196 restrictive immigration
   measures proposed between 2005 and 2012. Overall, the majority of Black
   Democratic legislators support restrictive immigration legislation,
   although at a consistently lower rate than White Democratic legislators.
   We test hypotheses that Black-White differences in support for
   restrictive immigration legislation depend upon the material resources
   at stake and the symbolic significance associated with specific
   legislation. Using bill topic to measure these conditions, we find that
   Black and White Democrats equally support immigrant "competition" bills
   on employment topics. Black Democratic legislators are less likely than
   their White counterparts to support immigration bills on Black-immigrant
   "commonalities" topics related to civil rights issues: voter ID
   regulations, education, police, and omnibus restrictions. Further, for
   civil rights bills only, district threat indicators such as a rapidly
   growing district Latino population are much more likely to increase
   support for restrictive immigration bills among White Democratic
   legislators than among Black Democratic legislators. Some district
   characteristics even evoke a commonalities response from African
   American Democratic legislators, reducing their support for restrictive
   legislation. Our research thus expands the competition/commonalities
   debate and highlights the complexities and contingencies of race
   relations and state policymaking in the twenty-first century.

   become increasingly polarized and that public opinion is embedded in
   broader institutional structures. Characteristics including education,

   individual acceptance of homosexuality, whereas the influence of age and

AB Even after two decades of intense research, social scientists are still
   in disagreement over whether the American public is polarized. Starting
   from the premise that disagreement is multifaceted, this paper attempts
   to clarify how and which aspects of ideological disagreement have
   changed over the past few decades. Three major structural features of
   ideological disagreement that have been discussed under the umbrella
   term "polarization" are identified from the literature-polarization,
   partisan sorting, and dimensional alignment-and redefined into
   analytically distinct and non-overlapping concepts. Two different
   scaling methods are applied to the American National Election Studies
   from 1980 to 2012 in order to examine changes in how citizens organize
   their attitudes regarding concrete political and social issues
   (operational ideology) and their self-identifications with the
   ideological labels "liberal" and "conservative" (symbolic ideology).
   Results show at best mixed evidence of growing polarization. Partisan
   sorting has increased over time on both symbolic and operational
   ideology. However, it is mainly the symbolic side on which disagreement
   across partisan lines is most pronounced. Finally, contrary to the
   popular notion of a culture war dividing the United States, the public
   has become less polarized on moral issues, and the moral dimension of
   citizens' operational ideology has become dealigned from the economic
   and civil rights dimension over the past decade.

AB Using data from several periods of English history and building on the

   education and attitudes toward women's and minority rights. First, we
   establish a strong association between the size of twenty-first-century
   educational institutions in a given location and the attitudes prevalent
   there: the proximity of a large college or university is associated with
   individual support for women's and minority rights, regardless of
   whether the individual has been to university. Second, we present
   evidence for high inter-temporal persistence in the geographical
   variation in the density of educational institutions over several
   centuries. Third, we show that the geographical distribution of later
   educational institutions depends not only on the distribution of
   medieval institutions, but also on correlates of medieval exposure to
   ethnic and religious diversity that are likely to have influenced
   attitudes. Institutions and culture co-evolve, and the inter-temporal
   persistence of the density of educational institutions is one mechanism
   (though probably not the only one) that explains the association between

AB The well-established association between economic output and carbon
   emissions has led researchers in sociology and related disciplines to
   study new approaches to climate change mitigation, including policies
   that stabilize or reduce GDP growth. Within this degrowth approach,
   working time reduction is a key policy lever to reduce emissions as well
   as protect employment. In the United States, the abdication of
   responsibility for mitigation by the federal government has led to the
   emergence of state climate leadership. This study is the first to
   analyze the relationship between emissions and working hours at the
   state level. Our findings suggest that over the 2007-2013 period,
   state-level carbon emissions and average working hours have a strong,
   positive relationship, which holds across a variety of model estimation
   techniques and net of various political, economic, and demographic
   drivers of emissions. We conclude that working time reduction may
   represent a multiple dividend policy, contributing to enhanced quality
   of life and lower unemployment as well as emissions mitigation.

AB The manner in which social categories combine to produce inequality lies
   at the heart of scholarship on social stratification. To date, scholars
   have largely pointed to two primary ways that negatively stereotyped
   categories may aggregate: 1) additive effects, whereby one category has
   similar consequences across the other category, and 2) amplified
   congruence, whereby a secondary category exacerbates the negative
   effects of the first category. This article develops an alternative
   potential aggregation pattern-muted congruence-which posits that when
   individuals evaluate others that occupy multiple social positions about
   which stereotypes are highly congruent, such as being black and being
   unemployed, the additional category membership will have limited
   influence over the ultimate evaluation. Using evidence from a field
   experiment, where fictitious applications were submitted to real job
   openings, I examine which aggregation pattern most accurately reflects
   how race and unemployment shape actual hiring decisions. In line with
   predictions from the "muted congruence" perspective, the findings
   indicate that racial discrimination is prominent, but that there are
   limited additional negative effects of unemployment for African American
   workers. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for
   understanding the aggregation of social categories in the production of
   inequality.

AB While health inequalities related to race/ethnicity, nativity, and age
   are well documented, it remains unclear how these axes of stratification
   combine to shape health trajectories, especially in middle and late
   life. This study addresses gaps in the literature by drawing on both
   life course and intersectionality perspectives to understand
   inequalities in morbidity trajectories. Using growth curve models
   applied to data from the Health and Retirement Study, I examine the life
   course patterning of health inequalities among US-and foreign-born
   non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans between
   the ages of 51 and 80 (N = 16,265). Findings are consistent with
   premature aging and cumulative disadvantage processes: US-and
   foreign-born blacks and Mexican Americans experience earlier health
   deterioration than US-born whites, and they also tend to exhibit steeper
   health declines with age. Moreover, contrary to the common assumption of
   monolithic healthy immigrant and erosion processes, results show that
   these processes are contingent on both race/ethnicity and age: compared
   with US-born whites, white immigrants have a persistent health
   advantage, while black and Mexican American immigrants experience a
   health disadvantage that increases with age. These results suggest that
   among nonwhite immigrants, the immigrant health advantage may be offset
   by cumulative exposure to racialized immigrant incorporation processes.
   A wide array of health-related factors including socioeconomic
   resources, health behaviors, and medical care account for some, but not
   all, group differences in morbidity trajectories. Findings highlight the
   utility of life course and intersectionality perspectives for
   understanding health inequalities.

AB This study uses insider ethnographic and interview data to examine one
   of the largest sustained collective actions in the history of the United
   States-the Wisconsin Uprising of 2011. It finds that this event took a
   highly unusual form due to a social relation that I term escalating
   moral obligation, a sense of solidaristic duty that grows increasingly
   fervent as others struggle on behalf of a shared cause. Each of three
   active groups within the movement engaged in arduous and unconventional
   resistance to controversial legislation, and did so in a manner that
   induced moral debt among the other groups. Fervency of commitment to the
   cause increased as a result of allies taking risky or self-sacrificial
   actions. Each group felt obligated to continue difficult mobilization as
   long as others continued theirs. Escalating moral obligation develops a
   simultaneously emergent, endogenous, and cognitive dimension of social
   movements. It is a relational mechanism linking political opportunity
   with actual mobilization. The political opportunity in this case was a
   combination of several conditions: an elite cleavage over the
   desirability of public unions, a more local balance of power allowing
   dissident legislators to obstruct but not defeat legislation, and an
   immediate severe popular reaction. This mechanism is potentially
   generalizable to other risky or arduous protests. When activists are
   motivated by the sacrifice or risk-taking of allied activists,
   escalating moral obligation is present. The concept links group-level
   imperatives with individual-level motivations. Escalating moral
   obligation shows one way that individual subjectivities can change
   through group interrelations and emotionally intense interactions.

AB Though bureaucratic corruption is widespread, social scientists have yet
   to develop a comprehensive model predicting ordinary people's engagement
   in corrupt exchanges with street-level bureaucrats. Our article fills
   this gap by specifying an individual-level causal model of bureaucratic
   corruption centered around three theoretically derived predictors:
   beliefs about acceptability of corruption, its perceived riskiness, and
   its utility to the offender. In doing so, we develop a theory of how
   institutional stability affects rates and causal pathways to
   bureaucratic corruption. Using the data from nationally representative
   surveys in Russia (N = 2,000) and Ukraine (N = 1,535), we test a
   path-diagramed structural equation model that accounts for endogeneity
   and the relationships among the theoretically derived predictors of
   corruption. The tests of our model in institutionally more stable Russia
   and less stable Ukraine, combined with OLS regression models on split
   samples from conflict areas within each country, show that when
   institutions have greater stability, (1) citizens are less likely to
   partake in bureaucratic corruption, and (2) the effects of theoretically
   derived predictors on corruption behavior are stronger. We are the first
   to incorporate into a theory of bureaucratic corruption a feedback loop
   whereby engagement in corruption reinforces perceptions of its spread,
   which in turn contributes to the belief that bribery is acceptable. Our
   findings explain the variation in corruption behavior among citizens of
   high-corruption societies, extend the institutional theory of social
   control, testify to the importance of contextualizing theories of crime,
   and reveal the need to tailor anti-corruption policies to specific
   institutional environments.

   choose when to drill, but production from existing wells is constrained
   by reservoir pressure, which decays as oil is extracted. The model
   implies a modified Hotelling rule for drilling revenues net of costs,
   explains why the production constraint typically binds, and rationalizes
   regional production peaks and observed patterns of prices, drilling, and
   production following demand and supply shocks.

AB I study intermediation via sequential bilateral bargaining in markets

   captures intermediation power. Competition governs trade within layers,
   and hold-ups generate intermediation rents in transactions between
   layers. Each trader's intermediation power reflects the competition
   among intermediation chains as measured by the number of layers
   separating the trader from buyers. Trade does not maximize welfare or
   minimize intermediation. The interplay between competition and hold-ups
   determines the level of inefficiency. Eliminating middlemen or
   transferring intermediation costs downstream increases seller profits.
   Downstream and upstream competition respond oppositely to either

AB Racial segregation between U.S. workplaces is greater today than it was
   a generation ago. This increase happened alongside declines in
   within-establishment occupational segregation, on which most prior
   research has focused. We examine more than 40 years of longitudinal data
   on the racial employment composition of every large private-sector
   workplace in the United States to calculate between- and
   within-establishment trends in racial employment segregation over time.
   We demonstrate that the return of racial establishment segregation owes
   little to within-establishment processes, but rather stems from
   differences in the turnover rates of more and less homogeneous
   workplaces. Present research on employment segregation focuses mainly on
   within-firm processes. By doing so, scholars may be overstating the
   country's progress on employment integration and ignoring other avenues
   of intervention that may give greater leverage for further integrating
   firms.

AB The negative impact of unemployment on individuals and its spillover to
   spouses is widely documented. However, we have a gap in our knowledge
   when it comes to the similar consequences of temporary employment. This
   is problematic, because although temporary jobs are often considered
   better alternatives to unemployment for endowing individuals with income
   and opportunities to connect to employers, they are also associated with
   stressors such as high levels of job insecurity and poor quality work,
   the effects of which might spill over to spouses. Using matched data
   from the British Household Panel Study, I show that temporary work is at
   least as detrimental as unemployment for spouses' subjective well-being,
   although there are differences. When experienced by husbands, temporary
   work, like unemployment, has a negative effect on wives' psychological
   well-being and life satisfaction. Yet, as opposed to unemployment,
   wives' temporary employment also spills over and negatively affects
   husbands' psychological well-being. Furthermore, coupled individuals'
   well-being is most affected when men are either unemployed or
   temporarily employed and their wives have permanent jobs, suggesting
   that the effect is related to gender deviation. The effects are robust
   after controlling for fixed individual characteristics that can
   influence both employment status and well-being outcomes.

AB Even with widespread interest, public perceptions of science remain

   has been the persistent assumption that publics require a base of
   scientific knowledge for science to have broad cultural meaning. Yet,
   recent advances in cultural and cognitive sociology point to alternative
   research programs seeking to identify how publics come to understand
   complex and uncertain issues, when information is incomplete and
   asymmetric. We use this approach to analyze data on public perceptions
   of how scientific different fields are from the 2006 and 2012 National
   Science Foundation's Science and Technology Survey. Our multivariate
   analyses allow us to approximate how mass publics map the social space
   of scientific professions, while accounting for individuals' social
   location and cultural identity (e.g., race, class, gender, age,
   scientific sophistication, and political ideology). We then focus our
   attention on public perceptions of sociology and economics. Overall, we
   find that public perceptions, rather than being disorganized, map onto
   recognizable dimensions indicating how publics distinguish between
   scientific professions.

AB Proponents of the Axial Age contend that parallel cultural developments
   between 800 and 200 BCE in what is today China, Greece, India, Iran, and
   Israel-Palestine constitute the global historical turning point toward
   modernity. The Axial Age concept is well-known and influential, but
   deficiencies in the historical evidence and sociological analysis
   available have thwarted efforts to evaluate the concept's major global
   contentions. As a result, the Axial Age concept remains controversial.
   Seshat: Global History Databank provides new tools for examining this
   topic in social formations across Afro-Eurasia during the first two
   millennia BCE and first millennium CE, allowing scholars to empirically
   evaluate the varied and contrasting claims researchers have put forward.
   Results undercut the notion of a specific "age" of axiality limited to a
   specific geo-temporal localization. Critical traits offered as evidence
   of an axial transformation by proponents of the Axial Age concept
   appeared across Afro-Eurasia hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of
   years prior to the proposed Axial Age. Our analysis raises important
   questions for future evaluations of this period and points the way
   toward empirically-led, historical-sociological investigations of the
   ideological and institutional foundations of complex societies.

AB In the present study, we examine the relationship between involvement in
   the criminal justice system and achieved socioeconomic status (SES), as
   well as the moderating effect of ascribed SES. Using data from the
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we find a
   nonlinear relationship between criminal justice involvement and achieved
   SES, such that deeper involvement leads to increasingly negative
   consequences on achieved SES. Furthermore, those coming from the highest
   socioeconomic backgrounds are not "protected" from the deleterious
   consequences of system involvement, but instead experience the greatest
   declines in achieved SES relative to where they started. In contrast,
   the effect of criminal justice involvement for those from below average
   ascribed SES is not significant. Our findings reinforce how normal such
   experiences are for people with the fewest resources, and also how
   system involvement inevitably destroys human capital, undermines future
   life chances, and ultimately promotes a "rabble" class.

AB Classic theory is ambiguous regarding what is most meaningful for
   workers and workplaces. Are bureaucratic rules most consequential by
   providing predictability, as suggested by Weber, or problematic, owing
   to assaults on autonomy? And what of proximate social relations, seen as
   fundamental in ethnographic, resistance, and justice accounts? This
   article's analyses, which draw on a unique sample of approximately 2,500
   German workers across heterogeneous contexts, reveal pronounced effects
   of horizontal and vertical social relations on worker (i.e.,
   satisfaction and fairness) and workplace (i.e., commitment and effort)
   outcomes. These effects, which hold for high- and low-status workers,
   exist beyond independent, mediating, or conditional associations with
   rules and have differing implications for women versus men. The authors
   discuss the importance of their findings for work, organizational, and
   inequality literatures and call for greater attention to relational
   dimensions of work-life, their frequent disconnect from bureaucratic
   structures, and the consequences for organizations and the individuals
   within.

   (2000-2010). We use these estimates to analyze the impact of simulated

AB This article combines tax, survey, and national accounts data to
   estimate the distribution of national income in the United States since
   1913. Our distributional national accounts capture 100% of national
   income, allowing us to compute growth rates for each quantile of the
   income distribution consistent with macroeconomic growth. We estimate
   the distribution of both pretax and posttax income, making it possible
   to provide a comprehensive view of how government redistribution affects
   inequality. Average pretax real national income per adult has increased
   60% from 1980 to 2014, but we find that it has stagnated for the bottom
   50% of the distribution at about $16,000 a year. The pretax income of
   the middle class-adults between the median and the 90th percentile-has
   grown 40% since 1980, faster than what tax and survey data suggest, due
   in particular to the rise of tax-exempt fringe benefits. Income has
   boomed at the top. The upsurge of top incomes was first a labor income
   phenomenon but has mostly been a capital income phenomenon since 2000.
   The government has offset only a small fraction of the increase in
   inequality. The reduction of the gender gap in earnings has mitigated
   the increase in inequality among adults, but the share of women falls
   steeply as one moves up the labor income distribution, and is only 11%
   in the top 0.1% in 2014.

AB We use new data on the pre- and postmigration wages of immigrants to the
   United States to measure wage gains at migration. The average immigrant
   from a middle-income or poor country increases their wage by a factor of
   two to three upon migration. This wage gain is small relative to the
   underlying gap in GDP per worker. In a development accounting framework,
   this finding implies that switching countries accounts for 40% of
   cross-country income differences, while human capital accounts for 60%.
   Wage gains decline with education, consistent with imperfect
   substitution between skill types. We augment our analysis to allow for
   this possibility and bound the human capital share in development
   accounting to between one-half and two-thirds. We also provide results
   on the importance of premigration sector of employment, assimilation,

AB We show that World War I and the subsequent boycott against Central
   scientists severely interrupted international scientific cooperation.
   After 1914, citations to recent research from abroad decreased and paper
   titles became less similar (evaluated by latent semantic analysis),
   suggesting a reduction in international knowledge flows. Reduced
   international scientific cooperation led to a decline in the production
   of basic science and its application in new technology Specifically, we
   compare productivity changes for scientists who relied on frontier
   research from abroad, to changes for scientists who relied on frontier
   research from home. After 1914, scientists who relied on frontier
   research from abroad published fewer papers in top scientific journals,
   produced less Nobel Prize nominated research, introduced fewer novel
   scientific words, and introduced fewer novel words that appeared in the
   text of subsequent patent grants. The productivity of scientists who
   relied on top 1% research declined twice as much as the productivity of
   scientists who relied on top 3% research. Furthermore, highly prolific
   scientists experienced the starkest absolute productivity declines. This
   suggests that access to the very best research is key for scientific and
   technological progress.

AB A growing literature examines the dynamics of social movement contention
   within and across "social fields." While fields tend toward stability,
   events and processes elsewhere in a broader system of fields can provide
   opportunities for movement mobilization. Most accounts see these
   cross-field dynamics as exogenous events, granting movements little
   control over when and how these opportunities might emerge. In contrast,
   this artide argues that activists can and do purposely create
   cross-field effects. Examining changes in contentious practice in the
   American labor movement-which in recent decades, has reoriented
   contention over workplace issues away from workplaces themselves, and
   toward political arenas more traditionally dominated by community
   concerns-this artide advances the concept of cross-field manipulation,
   purposive strategic action that accounts for the positioning of actors
   across social fields, triggering events in one field so as to reorder
   the dynamics of another. Using a historical study of evolving organizing
   practices in a Southern California hotel workers' union, including
   interviews and archival sources, the paper identifies three
   mechanisms-power analysis, alliance building, and actor-triggered
   crises-whereby labor activists purposely generate cross-field effects.
   Through repeated interactions with employers and polities, activists
   learned a unique campaign model that politicized workplace conflict in
   communities and markets, generating opportunities for workplace gains.

AB Women who choose to stay in abusive relationships occupy a morally
   ambiguous identity category. They are at once pitied for their

   over women who stay using the highly publicized case of Janay Rice, who
   actively defended her professional football player husband, Ray Rice,
   following the release of a video in which he knocked her unconscious.
   Specifically, we engage in sentiment analysis and qualitative coding of
   discourse on Twitter following key points in the case (N = 3,761). We
   show that negative sentiment towards Ray Rice, the media, and the
   National Football League act as dear mechanisms of boundary
   reinforcement through which abusers, exploiters, and enablers of abuse
   are morally censured. In contrast, Janay Rice becomes the site of a
   boundary war. Moral detractors accuse Janay of greed, mental incapacity,
   and jeopardizing women's safety and empowerment. Moral defenders
   neutralize Janay through allusions to pure victimhood and medical
   disorder, and valorize Janay as courageous, empowered, and devoted to
   her family. These moral debates, though centering on a single incident,
   represent the collective negotiation of meanings around women who stay.

AB Political consumption is a flourishing field of research at the
   intersection of consumer research and political sociology. Political
   consumption means the consideration of ethical or political motives in
   the decision to buy certain products. Its main forms are the buying
   (buycott) of products distinguished by certain ethical or political
   characteristics such as sustainability, social justice, or corporate
   responsibility, and the boycott of products that lack such
   characteristics. However, there is an ongoing discussion about the
   status of political consumption. Some authors suspect that it may
   distract citizens from more challenging forms of participation
   (crowding-out thesis). In contrast, most empirical research has shown
   that political consumers are also more active than the general
   population in other forms of political participation. However, this has
   only been shown for fairly general measures of political consumption and
   participation. Our contribution to this debate thus focuses on one
   specific form of political consumption and corresponding forms of
   participation: activism for the Global South and fair trade consumption,
   zooming in on the case of Switzerland, where fair trade consumption is
   quite widespread within the population. Our results show that fair trade
   consumption is only weakly related to other forms of engagement for
   Global South issues, thus it does not distract from more challenging
   forms of engagement, but it is also not part of a more general engaged
   lifestyle. This is supported by the fact that the motivations and
   structural underpinnings of other forms of activism for the Global South
   differ from those of fair trade consumption.

AB Is the standard hyperbolic-discounting model capable of robust

   a negative answer, we provide a positive one. We give conditions under
   which all Markov equilibria display either saving at all wealth levels
   or dissaving at all wealth levels. Moreover, saving versus dissaving is
   determined by a simple condition comparing the interest rate to a
   threshold made up of impatience parameters only. Our robustness results
   illustrate a well-behaved side of the model and imply that qualitative
   behavior is determinate, dissipating indeterminacy concerns to the
   contrary (Krusell and Smith, 2003). We prove by construction that
   equilibria always exist and that multiplicity is present in some cases,
   highlighting that our robust predictions are not due to uniqueness.
   Similar results may be obtainable in related dynamic games, such as

   even when they expect to resist temptation. To identify these
   self-control types, I design an experiment in which the temptation was
   to read a story during a tedious task. The identification strategy
   relies on a two-step procedure. First, I measure commitment demand by
   eliciting subjects' preferences over menus that did or did not allow
   access to the story. I then implement preferences using a random
   mechanism, allowing to observe subjects who faced the choice yet
   preferred commitment. A quarter to a third of subjects can be classified
   as self-control types according to their menu preferences. When
   confronted with the choice, virtually all of them behaved as they
   anticipated and resisted temptation. These findings suggest that
   policies restricting the availability of tempting options could have

   work, schedules induce two distortions: First, physicians slack off by
   accepting fewer patients near end of shift (EOS). Second, physicians
   distort patient care, incurring higher costs as they spend less time on
   patients assigned near EOS. Examining how these effects change with
   shift overlap reveals a tradeoff between the two. Within an hour after
   the normal time of work completion, physicians are willing to spend
   hospital resources more than six times their market wage to preserve
   their leisure. Accounting for overall costs, I find that physicians
   slack off at approximately second-best optimal levels.

   need to be supplemented by first-moment shocks to fit consumption over

AB This study's motivating premise is that the ideological context around
   race, ethnicity, and nationhood shapes the immigration politics of
   Mexican Americans in distinct eras of U.S. history. To examine this
   proposition we identify two cohorts of Mexican Americans-those who came
   of age in the World War II era and those who grew up during and after
   the Civil Rights movement-and examine whether there are systematic
   differences in how members of these cohorts interpret immigration
   issues. In line with our expectations, group consciousness predicts the
   attitudes of the Civil Rights cohort, but not of those in the World War
   II cohort. Furthermore, the predictive power of generational status-a
   centerpiece of assimilation-based analyses of Latinos' immigration

   support our argument that Mexican Americans' position on the immigration
   debate is not simply a function of varied levels of assimilation or
   group attachments, but is also shaped by the national ideological
   context around immigration in the United States. Our work provides the
   most comprehensive analysis of Mexican Americans' immigration attitudes
   to date, filling gaps for scholars interested in the effects of
   assimilation, group consciousness, and temporal effects on Latino public
   opinion. This work also highlights the need to incorporate temporal
   measures into research on Latinos' complex relationship to co-ethnic
   immigrants.

AB Academic stratification during educational transitions may be
   maintained, disrupted, or exacerbated. This study marks the first to use
   national data to investigate how the transition to high school
   (re)shapes academic status at the intersection of race/ethnicity and
   gender. We seek to identify the role of the high school transition in
   shaping racial/ethnic and gender stratification by contextualizing
   students' academic declines during the high school transition within the
   longer window of their educational careers. Using Add Health, we find
   that white and black boys experience the greatest drops in their grade
   point averages (GPAs). We also find that the maintenance of high
   academic grades between the eighth and ninth grades varies across
   racial/ethnic and gender subgroups; higher-achieving middle school black
   boys experience the greatest academic declines. Importantly, we find
   that white and black boys also faced academic declines before the high
   school transition, whereas their female student peers experienced
   academic declines only during the transition to high school. We advance
   current knowledge on educational stratification by identifying the
   transition to high school as a juncture in which boys' academic
   disadvantage widens and high-achieving black boys lose their academic
   status at the high school starting gate. Our study also underscores the
   importance of adopting an intersectional framework that considers both
   race/ethnicity and gender. Given the salience of high school grades for
   students' long-term success, we discuss the implications of this study
   for racial/ethnic and gender stratification during and beyond high
   school.

AB With the intensification of policing and criminalization over the last
   three decades, residents of impoverished black communities are
   increasingly subject to street-level criminalization. This article
   examines how policing shapes the construction of gender and sexuality
   among its (potential) targets. Drawing on 12 months of fieldwork and
   interviews with 60 black youth living on Chicago's South Side, we find
   that in order to reduce the probability of a stop-and-frisk, young black
   men engage in reflexive and embodied masculinity performances. Aware
   that officers are most likely to detain and interrogate individuals who
   outwardly display toughness, emotional restrictiveness, and a proclivity
   for violence associated with the "cool pose" and the "code of the
   street," youth attempt to communicate their innocence by exaggerating
   displays of emotional sensitivity, caring, vulnerability, and passivity.
   They concretely do so by overemphasizing (and even feigning) romantic
   involvement in heterosexual relationships-a strategy they refer to as
   "getting cover." Although "doing masculinity" in this manner may assist
   black youth in avoiding criminalization, it privileges dominant,
   mainstream (and often-unattainable) expressions of gender and sexuality
   while reinforcing hegemonic masculinity and heteronormativity. We offer
   a grounded, interactional framework for analyzing residents' situational
   and contingent responses to criminalization, which are characterized by
   a far greater degree of agency and innovation than previously assumed.

AB Recent research documents the public discontent with high income
   inequality yet an important limitation in our understanding is why such
   high pay is problematic according to many Americans. This study
   juxtaposes two explanations for the discontent that many Americans have
   shown regarding high Chief Executive Officer (CEO) pay: a) that the
   American discontent with extremely high CEO pay stems mainly from a
   belief that CEOs are not contributing highly enough to merit such high
   pay and b) the American discontent with extremely high pay is due to
   such pay being objectionable in principle. Using data from a national
   survey experiment (N = 989) uniquely designed to test these
   propositions, this study evaluates the relationship between performance
   and fair CEO pay. Respondents show aversion to high CEO pay while also
   embracing the principle of proportionality of rewards and contributions.
   Findings suggest that discontent with extremely high pay may be
   reconciled with support for pay for performance: the slope of the pay
   and performance function may be at issue rather than a hard limit on
   pay.

   find large changes in communication patterns after transparency. We then
   propose a difference-in-differences approach inspired by the career
   concerns literature, and find evidence for both effects. Finally, we
   construct an influence measure that suggests the discipline effect
   dominates.

AB Within neighborhood studies, the organizational dimension has been
   relatively neglected despite theory predicting a relative lack of
   organizations in more deprived neighborhoods. This article provides a
   longitudinal empirical perspective, using a novel data set that follows
   through time over 125,000 charitable organizations across the full
   distribution of neighborhood contexts in England from the mid-1990s
   onward. It shows that there are enduring, sizable, and extensive
   differences in the density of charitable organizations according to
   neighborhood deprivation and that these differences persist over time
   even as neighborhoods experience organizational turnover. It shows that
   these differences in density are maintained through reinforcing
   processes: first, compared to less deprived neighborhoods, in more
   deprived neighborhoods fewer charities are founded per person; second,
   even after foundation, charities in more deprived areas experience a
   higher hazard of dissolution.

AB Status behaviors are verbal and nonverbal behaviors that elevate or
   lower the status of the individuals who perform them and that can
   combine to create status hierarchies in task groups. This article
   identifies how status behavior could promote contributions to public
   goods in social dilemma situations through its ability to organize a
   groupthat is, through its ability to generate a status hierarchy and
   mobilize contributions from all members of a groupand offers an
   explanation for the evolution of cooperative status behavior. The
   evolutionary viability of cooperative status behavior derives from its
   orientation toward hierarchy: status behavior tends to produce hierarchy
   in groups, and status behavior discriminates between the presence and
   absence of hierarchy. Cooperative status actors achieve mutual
   cooperation when they encounter each other but are protected from
   exploitation when a collectively recognized hierarchy is not present.
   This article shows that a strategy of cooperative status behavior can
   proliferate under conditions that otherwise make cooperation impossible.

AB Drawing on interviews with 194 market participants (including 54
   practitioners of high-frequency trading or HFT), this article first
   identifies the main classes of signals (patterns of data) that influence
   how HFT algorithms buy and sell shares and interact with each other.
   Second, it investigates historically the processes that have led to
   three of the most important categories of these signals, finding that
   they arise from three features of U.S. share trading that are the result
   of episodes of meso-level conflict. Third, the article demonstrates the
   contingency of these features by briefly comparing HFT in share trading
   to HFT in futures, Treasurys, and foreign exchange. The article thus
   argues that how HFT algorithms act and interact is a specific,
   contingent product not just of the current but also of the past
   interaction of people, organizations, algorithms, and machines.

AB In recent years, sociologists have focused less on cultural tastes as
   effects of social structure and more on their causal efficacy in the
   creation and maintenance of social ties. Progress on this agenda has
   been hindered, however, by limitations in theory, methods, and available
   data. This article attempts to advance all three fronts. First, it
   clarifies, integrates, and expands upon prior work to develop a more
   comprehensive theoretical framework for examining the conversion of
   cultural tastes into social relationships. Second, it introduces a
   powerful network modeling tool, stochastic actor-based modeling, that is
   uniquely capable of implementing this framework. Third, it illustrates
   the utility of these advances using an original, longitudinal data set
   based on the behavior of a cohort of college students on Facebook.
   Findings from this application suggest several general substantive
   propositions about capital conversion, providing a starting point for
   future research.

AB This article uses a new database of subscribers to the New York
   Philharmonic to explore how high culture became a form of socially
   valuable capital in late-19th-century America. The authors find support
   for the classic account of high culture's purification and
   exclusiveness, showing how over the long Gilded Age the social elite of
   New York attended the Philharmonic both increasingly and in more
   socially patterned ways. Yet they also find that the orchestra opened up
   to a new group of subscribers hailing from an emerging professional,
   managerial, and intellectual middle class. Importantly, the inclusion of
   this new audience was segregated: they did not mingle with elites in the
   concert hall. This segregated inclusion paved a specific way for the
   constitution of cultural capital. It meant that greater purity and
   greater inclusiveness happened together, enabling elite cultural
   participation to remain distinctive while elite tastes acquired broader
   social currency.

   ruptures affects later mental health. We find that prenatal exposure to
   the death of a maternal relative increases take-up of ADHD medications
   during childhood and anti-anxiety and depression medications in
   adulthood. Further, family ruptures during pregnancy depress birth
   outcomes and raise the risk of perinatal complications necessitating
   hospitalization. Our results suggest large welfare gains from preventing
   fetal stress from family ruptures and possibly from economically induced
   stressors such as unemployment. They further suggest that greater stress
   exposure among the poor may partially explain the intergenerational
   persistence of poverty.

AB What explains variation in individual attitudes toward government
   deficits? Although macroeconomic stance is of paramount importance for
   contemporary governments, our understanding of its popular politics is
   limited. We argue that popular attitudes regarding austerity are
   influenced by media (and wider elite) framing. Information necessary to
   form preferences on the deficit is not provided neutrally, and its
   provision shapes how voters understand their interests. A wide range of
   evidence from Britain between 2010 and 2015 supports this claim. In the
   British Election Study, deficit attitudes vary systematically with the
   source of news consumption, even controlling for party identification. A
   structural topic model of two major newspapers' reporting shows that
   content varies systematically with respect to coverage of public
   borrowing-in ways that intuitively accord with the attitudes of their
   readership. Finally, a survey experiment suggests causation from media
   to attitudes: deficit preferences change based on the presentation of
   deficit information.

AB While a large literature recognizes that economic crises threaten the
   stability of electoral autocracies, we know relatively little about how
   citizens form economic perceptions and how they attribute blame for
   worsening conditions in these regimes. To gain traction on these
   questions, I exploit subnational variation in economic performance
   across Russia's regions during a recent downturn, combining regionally
   representative surveys of more than 67,000 voting-age respondents with
   data on growth and unemployment. Contrary to conventional wisdom that
   citizens are passive consumers of propaganda, I show that they extract
   objective economic information from personal experience and local
   conditions. Moreover, I find that they give greater weight to this
   information where regional party dominance makes economic performance a
   clearer indicator of the ruling party's competence and when they believe
   the media are biased. These results suggest limits on illiberal regimes'
   ability to exploit informational asymmetries to bolster popular support
   during economic downturns.

   well-ordered society, fails to accommodate deep disagreement and is
   insufficiently dynamic. In response, we formulate an alternative model
   that we call the open society, organized around a new account of dynamic
   stability. In the open society, constitutional rules must be stable
   enough to preserve social conditions that foster experimentation, while
   leaving room in legal and institutional rules for innovation and change.
   Systemic robustness and dynamic stability become important for the open
   society in a way that they are not in the well-ordered society. This
   model of the open society and the corresponding model of stability have
   interesting implications for thinking about the goals, norms, and

AB What determines whether countries' institutions attract or deter
   investment? Although existing theories predict that multinational
   enterprises (MNEs) avoid locations where institutions cannot constrain
   public and private actors' opportunistic behavior, we argue host
   institutions' attractiveness depends on firms' home environment. Home
   country institutions shape firms' practices and capabilities, thus
   helping to determine the environments that firms are best prepared to
   face abroad. We test our predictions using multiple data sets at
   different levels of analysis: firm-level data on MNEs' foreign
   subsidiaries, data on bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI)
   positions, and longitudinal data on bilateral FDI flows. We find that
   states with independent judiciaries are particularly attractive to
   investment from countries also possessing independent courts. Similarly,
   countries with low judicial independence disproportionately send FDI to
   countries lacking independent judiciaries. These findings' implications
   challenge conventional wisdom: "Good" institutions may not attract all
   investors, and "bad" institutions may not always deter, as current
   research suggests.

   political processes is being reduced to achievements and standpoints of
   individual politicians, and the importance of rational opinion building
   is discounted. The results of the current study provide the first
   empirical evidence to account for the misgivings about emotional effects
   of personalized political information on media audiences. Using data
   from an online experiment, this study shows that news coverage regarding
   behaviors and personal characteristics of a foreign leader influences
   (a) evaluations of personal characteristics typical of his or her
   nation's citizens and (b) emotional perceptions of that leader's country
   (sentiment and respect). This effect is shown to reflect a psychological
   phenomenon whereby people project their emotions and perceptions
   regarding a leader's personal characteristics onto his or her country

AB Since the 1970s, market restructuring has shifted many workers into
   workplaces heavily reliant on sales to outside corporate buyers. These
   outside buyers wield substantial power over working conditions among
   their suppliers. During the same period, wage growth for middle-income
   workers stagnated. By extending organizational theories of wage-setting
   to incorporate interactions between organizations, I predict that wage
   stagnation resulted in part from production workers' heightened exposure
   to buyer power. Panel data on publicly traded companies shows that
   dependence on large buyers lowers suppliers' wages and accounts for 10
   percent of wage stagnation in nonfinancial firms since the 1970s. These
   results are robust to a series of supplementary measures of buyer power;
   instrumental variable analysis using mergers between buyers; corrections
   for selection and missing data; and controls for individual worker
   characteristics like education and occupation. The results show how
   product market restructuring and new forms of economic segmentation
   affect workers' wages. The spread of unequal bargaining relations
   between corporate buyers and their suppliers has slowed wage growth for
   workers.

AB Women earn better grades than men across levels of educationbut to what
   end? This article assesses whether men and women receive equal returns
   to academic performance in hiring. I conducted an audit study by
   submitting 2,106 job applications that experimentally manipulated
   applicants' GPA, gender, and college major. Although GPA matters little
   for men, women benefit from moderate achievement but not high
   achievement. As a result, high-achieving men are called back
   significantly more often than high-achieving women-at a rate of nearly
   2-to-1. I further find that high-achieving women are most readily
   penalized when they major in math: high-achieving men math majors are
   called back three times as often as their women counterparts. A survey
   experiment conducted with 261 hiring decision-makers suggests that these
   patterns are due to employers' gendered standards for applicants.
   Employers value competence and commitment among men applicants, but
   instead privilege women applicants who are perceived as likeable. This
   standard helps moderate-achieving women, who are often described as
   sociable and outgoing, but hurts high-achieving women, whose
   personalities are viewed with more skepticism. These findings suggest
   that achievement invokes gendered stereotypes that penalize women for
   having good grades, creating unequal returns to academic performance at
   labor market entry.

AB The "elitist approach" to democratization contends that "democratic
   regimes that last have seldom, if ever, been instituted by mass popular
   actors" (Huntington 1984:212). This article subjects this observation to
   empirical scrutiny using statistical analyses of new democracies over
   the past half-century and a case study. Contrary to the elitist
   approach, I argue that new democracies growing out of mass mobilization
   are more likely to survive than are new democracies that were born amid
   quiescence. Survival analysis of 112 young democracies in 80 different
   countries based on original data shows that the longer the mobilization,
   the more likely the ensuing democracy is to survive. I use a case study
   of South Africa to investigate the mechanisms. I argue that sustained
   unarmed uprisings have generated the longest-lasting new
   democracieslargely because they are forced to develop an organizational
   structure, which provides a leadership cadre for the new regime, forges
   links between the government and society, and strengthens checks on the
   power of the post-transition government.

   been scaled back across the OECD. An overview of the results of 130
   quantitative studies analysing at least one of these indicators is

   Europeanization, learning and emulation, socio-economic problems, and
   political parties - only limited agreement in the literature is found.
   The reasons for this disagreement are discussed. Ways forward are
   suggested for the theoretical models on which studies are based, how the

   be combined.

   addition, more educated workers have steeper profiles than the less

   has been the low levels of women's elected representation in many

   two large, comparative data sets, we find that the proportion of women
   elected representatives at the time of the survey has no significant
   effect on the gender gap. By contrast, there is a strong and significant
   long-term impact for descriptive representation when respondents were
   aged 18 to 21. The results are in line with political socialization,
   which posits that the impact of political context is greatest during

   masculinity of the position, particularly in states that are engaged in
   fatal disputes, governed by military dictators, and large military
   spenders. By contrast, female defense ministers emerge when expectations

AB Existing approaches to estimating ideal points offer no method for
   consistent estimation or inference without relying on strong parametric
   assumptions. In this paper, I introduce a nonparametric approach to
   ideal-point estimation and inference that goes beyond these limitations.
   I show that some inferences about the relative positions of two pairs of
   legislators can be made with minimal assumptions. This information can
   be combined across different possible choices of the pairs to provide
   estimates and perform hypothesis tests for all legislators without
   additional assumptions. I demonstrate the usefulness of these methods in
   two applications to Supreme Court data, one testing for ideological
   movement by a single justice and the other testing for multidimensional
   voting behavior in different decades.

AB Computers hold the potential to draw legislative districts in a neutral
   way. Existing approaches to automated redistricting may introduce bias
   and encounter difficulties when drawing districts of large and even
   medium-sized jurisdictions. We present a new algorithm that can
   neutrally generate legislative districts without indications of bias
   that are contiguous, balanced and relatively compact. The algorithm does
   not show the kinds of bias found in prior algorithms and is an advance
   over previously published algorithms for redistricting because it is
   computationally more efficient. We use the new algorithm to draw 10,000
   maps of congressional districts in Mississippi, Virginia, and Texas. We
   find that it is unlikely that the number of majority-minority districts
   we observe in the Mississippi, Virginia, and Texas congressional maps of
   these states would happen through a neutral redistricting process.

AB Despite the popularity of unsupervised techniques for political science
   text-as-data research, the importance and implications of preprocessing
   decisions in this domain have received scant systematic attention. Yet,
   as we show, such decisions have profound effects on the results of real
   models for real data. We argue that substantive theory is typically too
   vague to be of use for feature selection, and that the supervised
   literature is not necessarily a helpful source of advice. To aid
   researchers working in unsupervised settings, we introduce a statistical
   procedure and software that examines the sensitivity of findings under
   alternate preprocessing regimes. This approach complements a
   researcher's substantive understanding of a problem by providing a
   characterization of the variability changes in preprocessing choices may
   induce when analyzing a particular dataset. In making scholars aware of
   the degree to which their results are likely to be sensitive to their
   preprocessing decisions, it aids replication efforts.

AB Representative democracy entails the aggregation of multiple policy
   issues by parties into competing bundles of policies, or manifestos,
   which are then evaluated holistically by voters in elections. This
   aggregation process obscures the multidimensional policy preferences
   underlying a voter's single choice of party or candidate. We address
   this problem through a conjoint experiment based on the actual party
   manifestos in Japan's 2014 House of Representatives election. By
   juxtaposing sets of issue positions as hypothetical manifestos and
   asking respondents to choose one, our study identifies the effects of
   specific positions on the overall assessment of manifestos,
   heterogeneity in preferences among subgroups of respondents, and the
   popularity ranking of manifestos. Our analysis uncovers important
   discrepancies between voter preferences and the portrayal of the
   election results by politicians and the media as providing a policy
   mandate to the Liberal Democratic Party, underscoring the potential
   danger of inferring public opinion from election outcomes alone.

   complete case estimator can be unbiased, even if data are not missing
   completely at random. As long as the analyst can control for the
   determinants of missingness, MI offers no benefit over LWD for bias
   reduction in regression analysis. We highlight the conditions under
   which MI is most likely to improve the accuracy and precision of
   regression results, and develop concrete guidelines that researchers can
   adopt to increase transparency and promote confidence in their results.
   While MI remains a useful approach in certain contexts, it is no
   panacea, and access to imputation software does not absolve researchers
   of their responsibility to know the data.

AB The sole purpose of the enhanced standard analysis (ESA) is to prevent
   so-called untenable assumptions in Qualitative Comparative Analysis
   (QCA). One source of such assumptions can be statements of necessity.
   QCA realists, the majority of QCA researchers, have elaborated a set of
   criteria for meaningful claims of necessity: empirical consistency,
   empirical relevance, and conceptual meaningfulness. I show that once
   Thiem's (2017) data mining approach to detecting supersets is
   constrained by adhering to those standards, no CONSOL effect of
   Schneider and Wagemann's ESA exists. QCA idealists, challenging most of
   QCA realists' conventions, argue that separate searches for necessary
   conditions are futile because the most parsimonious solution formula
   reveals the minimally necessary disjunction of minimally sufficient
   conjunctions. Engaging with this perspective, I address several
   unresolved empirical and theoretical issues that seem to prevent the QCA
   idealist position from becoming mainstream.

AB Emotions feature prominently in political rhetoric and media frames, and
   they have potent effects on how people process information. Yet,
   existing research has largely overlooked the influence of disgust, which
   is a basic emotion that leads people to avoid contamination threats. We
   illustrate how disgust may impede learning, as compared to the more
   commonly studied emotion of anxiety. Disgust and anxiety are natural
   reactions to many kinds of political threats, but the two emotions
   influence political engagement in different ways. This study
   investigated the distinctive effects of disgust in a series of
   experiments that manipulated information about the outbreak of an
   infectious disease. People who felt disgusted by a health threat were
   less likely to learn crucial facts about the threat and less likely to
   seek additional information. Thus, disgust has the counterintuitive
   effect of decreasing public engagement in precisely those situations
   where it is most critical.

AB Prevalent models of issue voting view vote choice as a choice among

   all voters, and their composition is left to researchers' discretion.
   This article aims to relax such assumptions by presenting a model with a
   varying probability of inclusion in the choice set. We apply the
   "constrained choice conditional logistic regression" to survey data from
   the 1989 parliamentary election in Norway to examine the effects of
   party identification of voters and electoral viability and policy
   extremity of parties on individual voters' choice set compositions.
   Further, we look into the effect of parties' policy positions on their
   electoral fates under alternative assumptions about the composition of
   voters' choice sets. We find that voters' choice set composition
   conditions both the effects of their policy considerations on vote
   choice and those of parties' policy offerings on their electoral fates.

   are eventually confirmed. Results show nominee ideology and decision

AB Ukraine's anti-government protests in 2013 2014, and the ensuing removal
   of President Yanukovich, raised much speculation about Russia's role in
   the outcome of the crisis, as well as more general questions related to
   third-party influence on domestic protests and repression. Does
   third-party assistance to the government increase the level of
   government repression or deter protesters? Does the leader removal
   indicate that foreign involvement was a failure? Or can a third party
   gain from involvement, even if its protege leader is removed from power?
   We model external influence on the onset of protests and repression as a
   game between the government, the protesters, and a third party that
   supports the government. The main finding is that a third party may
   "bankroll" repression against the protesters, even at the risk of the
   removal of their protege leader, with the goal of deterring future
   protests within its sphere of interest.

   A woman occupying a high-profile office directly impacts women's

   motivating other women to run for office. We posit that prominent women
   in politics serve as role models for other women interested in political
   careers, causing an increase in female candidates. We test this theory
   with data from the American states, which exhibit considerable variation
   in the sex of state legislative candidates and the high-profile offices
   of governor and U.S. senator. Using a weighting method and data spanning
   1978-2012, we demonstrate that high-profile women exert substantively

   on the economic vote within Latin American democracies, but one uniquely
   associated with its presidential regimes and dynamic party systems.
   Rules for these elections-such as concurrence, term limits, and

   Evidence from two studies supports our argument. In three nationally

   domains, we find that the public reacts negatively when policies are
   achieved through unilateral powers instead of through legislation passed
   by Congress. We further show these costs are greatest among respondents
   who support the president's policy goals. In an observational study, we
   show that attitudes toward unilateral action in the abstract affect how
   respondents evaluate policies achieved through unilateral action by

AB Partisanship often colors how citizens perceive real-world conditions.
   For example, an oft-documented finding is that citizens tend to view the
   state of the national economy more positively if their party holds
   office. These partisan perceptual gaps are usually taken as a result of
   citizens' own motivated reasoning to defend their party identity.
   However, little is known about the extent to which perceptual gaps are
   shaped by one of the most important forces in politics: partisan elites.
   With two studies focusing on perceptions of the economya
   quasi-experimental panel study and a randomized experimentwe show how
   partisan perceptual differences are substantially affected by messages
   coming from party elites. These findings imply that partisan elites are
   more influential on, and more responsible for, partisan perceptual

AB In recent years, several oppressive leaders have been arrested and
   extradited to international courts. What are the consequences of this
   global justice cascade? I address this question by examining patterns of
   exile. I show that the justice cascade has a differential effect on
   leaders based on their culpability (whether they presided over atrocity
   crimes). In the past, culpable and nonculpable leaders went into exile
   at virtually identical rates. Today, however, culpable leaders are about
   six times less likely to flee abroad because exile no longer guarantees
   a safe retirement. These findings raise stark implications for existing
   research that debates whether international justice deters atrocities or
   prolongs conflicts. My results about exiled leaders, I explain, imply
   that the justice cascade should deter atrocities and prolong conflicts.
   Thus, instead of debating whether international justice is helpful or

AB Redistribution programs in developing countries often leak because local

   We study one approach to reducing leakage. In an experiment in over 550
   villages, we test whether mailing cards with program information to
   targeted beneficiaries increases the subsidy they receive from a
   subsidized rice program. On net, beneficiaries received 26 percent more
   subsidy in card villages. Ineligible households received no less, so
   this represents substantially lower leakage.

   our context. We quantify the effects of new music on welfare using an
   explicit structural model of demand and entry with potentially
   unpredictable product quality. On the basis of plausible forecasting
   models of expected appeal, a tripling of the choice set according to
   expected quality adds substantially more consumer surplus as the usual

AB Current theories of occupational status conceptualize it as either a
   function of cultural esteem or the symbolic aspect of the class
   structure. Based on Weber's definition of status as rooted in either
   cultural or class conditions, we argue that a consistent
   operationalization of occupational status must account for both of these
   dimensions. Using quantitative measures of cultural sentiments for
   occupational identities, we use affect control theory to model the
   network deference relations across occupations. We calculate a measure
   of the extent to which one occupational actor deferring to another is
   incongruent with cultural expectations for all possible combinations of
   304 occupational titles. Because high-status actors are less likely to
   defer to low-status actors, the degree to which these events violate
   cultural expectations provides an indicator of the relative status
   position of different occupations. We assess the construct validity of
   our new deference score measure using Harris Poll data. Deference scores
   are more predictive of status rankings from poll data than are
   occupational prestige scores. We establish criterion validity using five
   theoretically relevant workplace outcomes: subjective work attachment,
   job satisfaction, general happiness, the importance of meaningful work,
   and perceived respect at work.

   Drawing on genome-wide data and educational attainment measures from the
   Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),
   I conduct polygenic score analyses to examine genetic confounding in the
   estimation of parents' and grandparents' influences on their children's
   and grandchildren's educational attainment. I also examine social
   genetic effects (i.e., genetic effects that operate through the social
   environment) in the transmission of educational attainment across three
   generations. Two-generation analyses produce three important findings.
   First, about one-fifth of the parent-child association in education
   reflects genetic inheritance. Second, up to half of the association
   between parents' polygenic scores and children's education is mediated
   by parents' education. Third, about one-third of the association between
   children's polygenic scores and their educational attainment is
   attributable to parents' genotypes and education. Three-generation
   analyses suggest that genetic confounding on the estimate of the direct
   effect of grandparents' education on grandchildren's education (net of
   parents' education) may be inconsequential, and I find no evidence that
   grandparents' genotypes significantly influence grandchildren's
   education through non-biological pathways. The three-generation results
   are suggestive, and the results may change when different samples are
   used.

AB Are men and women categorized differently for similar sexual behavior?
   Building on theories of gender, sexuality, and status, we introduce the
   concept of precarious sexuality to suggest that men's-but not
   women's-heterosexuality is an especially privileged identity that is
   easily lost. We test our hypotheses in a series of survey experiments
   describing a person who has a sexual experience conflicting with their
   sexual history. We find that a single same-sex sexual encounter leads an
   observer to question a heterosexual man's sexual orientation to a
   greater extent than that of a heterosexual woman in a similar situation.
   We also find that a different-sex sexual encounter is more likely to
   change others' perceptions of a lesbian woman's sexual
   orientation-compared to perceptions of a gay man's sexual orientation.
   In two conceptual replications, we vary the level of intimacy of the
   sexual encounter and find consistent evidence for our idea of precarious
   sexuality for heterosexual men. We close with a general discussion of
   how status beliefs influence categorization processes and with
   suggestions for extending our theoretical propositions to other
   categories beyond those of sexual orientation.

   these initial classifications of smells, and later, in how participants
   apply those evaluations to reify social boundaries and reproduce social

   two cognitive mechanism-sembodied simulation and iterative

AB Existing deprivation scales identify a majority of the population in
   each European Union (EU) country with zero deprivation. In this article,
   I hypothesize and test whether scoring zero on amaterial deprivation
   scale is a qualitatively different phenomenon to scoring at least one by
   applying and comparing multiple count models. I then examine how
   neglecting the distinctiveness of zeros, as the case in conventional
   models, influences our understanding of deprivation risk (deprived vs.
   non-deprived) and deprivation level (high vs. low deprivation),
   specifically regarding their relationship to social class. Consistently
   across 25 EU countries, the findings show that those with zero
   deprivation have significantly distinct profiles to those who have at
   least one deprivation. These results are robust to different weighting
   and index specifications. I then demonstrate how neglecting the
   distinctiveness of zeros results in significant underestimation of the
   strong social class gradient in risk of deprivation, and significant
   overestimation of the rather weak social class gradient in level of
   deprivation. Moreover, accounting for the distinctiveness of zeros
   reveals the conceptual difference between the risk and the level of
   deprivation given their different determinants, while conventional
   models identify the same determinants for both. These latter findings
   are also broadly consistent across 25 EU countries, with some exceptions
   in countries with very low level of zeros, such as Hungary, Bulgaria,
   and Romania. Relevant scales with a zero threshold can be used to study
   deprivation or to measure poverty in the EU yet either with some
   reconsiderations of conceptual and data problems or using a consistent
   poverty approach.

   distribution and subjective wellbeing, using nationally representative
   data from Hungary. We show that the association between the woman's
   relative income (WRI) ( the woman's share of the couple's total income)
   and life satisfaction is negative not only for men but for women as
   well. Because we control for financial disadvantages on the individual
   and household level, as well as for socio-economic and job
   characteristics of the respondent and their partner, the result can be
   interpreted as the impact of traditional gender roles and the
   persistence of the traditional male breadwinner mentality. In addition,
   we show that gender norms moderate this negative association. Among
   those with low levels of traditional norms, the WRI has no effect on
   life satisfaction, whereas among those who prefer traditional gender
   roles, the negative association is stronger. Our results suggest that
   conflicts between the gender norms and the social and economic reality
   reduce life satisfaction.

AB Numerous recent studies have reported that informal social contact with
   family and relatives generally improves happiness. However, several
   studies suggest that the effect of informal social contact with family
   and relatives might vary among countries. Therefore, by focusing on
   defamilialization, this article examines how the influence of informal
   social contact with family and relatives on happiness differs among
   less-and more-defamilialized countries. This article uses individual
   data from the 2007 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) combined
   with country-level data and a country fixed-effects model with robust
   standard errors to examine the cross-level interaction effects of
   defamilialization and informal social contact with family and relatives
   on happiness. In a cross-national comparison, a moderation effect of
   defamilialization on the association between informal social contact
   with family and relatives and happiness was observed in the overall
   sample and in women. These results indicate that defamilialization might
   change the meaning of relationships with family and relatives.

AB Generally, adult children are perceived to have obligations to support
   their parents, but now that divorce and remarriage are common phenomena,
   the question arises to which parent-figures this norm applies. We derive
   hypotheses on normative obligations towards step-parents and biological
   parents and the role of co-residential history and divorce. From the
   perspective of remarriage as an 'incomplete institution', we argue that
   obligations towards step-parents are more ambiguous and therefore more
   conditional. We collected unique vignette data (N = 4,783) as part of a
   nationally representative Dutch panel study and predicted norms on adult
   children's obligations to provide socio-emotional and practical support
   using fixed-effects models. We found weaker norms to support
   step-parents. These are even weaker if there is no coresidential history
   and/or the step-parent divorced the child's biological parent, while
   only co-residence affects norms to support biological parents, and less
   so than for step-parents. The most 'disadvantaged' type of biological
   parent (divorced, non-residential) is still more advantaged than the
   most 'advantaged' step-parent (married, residential), emphasizing the
   importance of biology. Analysis of residual variance shows less
   consensus on obligations towards step-parents than biological parents.
   It seems that given the absence of clear norms of behaviour, normative
   obligations towards step-parents are more conditional.

AB A central argument for the deregulation of employment contracts is that
   fixed-term contracts boost employment of jobseekers with uncertain
   productivity by giving employers a tool to screen such applicants over a
   longer period of time before permanent hire. We test this proposition by
   comparing the risk of entering fixed-term employment for individually
   laid-off workers with that for individuals who have left their previous
   job for other reasons. This strategy is based on the assumption that in
   the German context individual lay-offs create uncertainty about
   jobseekers' productivity. We use data on work exits and subsequent
   labour market re-entry of the prime-age workforce in Germany from waves
   2000-2013 of the Socio-Economic Panel. Our results show that the risk of
   fixed-term employment is substantively smaller after voluntary job exits
   but reveal only a small and statistically insignificant risk difference
   between individual lay-offs and workplace closures after adjusting for
   differences in socio-economic background and characteristics of the
   previous job. These findings challenge the view that employers use
   fixed-term contracts as an instrument to screen specific groups of
   workers whose productivity is highly uncertain, at least with regard to
   recent career disruptions.

   seems not to be well recognized, but the logit model is widely used in

AB We introduce learning into an otherwise standard two-sided
   search-and-bargaining market. There is uncertainty about the price
   distribution due to uncertainty about an underlying exogenous state of
   relative demand: in the high state, buyers are on the long side;
   otherwise, they are on the short side. In equilibrium, prices are on
   average higher in the high state. Individual agents learn about the
   distribution while searching. Agents typically start out by
   experimenting with a tough bargaining position-buyers may initially
   insist on a low price and sellers on a high price. After successive
   failures to trade, agents become increasingly pessimistic about the
   market conditions and soften their bargaining stance. When frictions are
   small, equilibrium transaction prices are approximately market clearing,
   despite aggregate demand being unknown. Thus, the search-and-bargaining
   procedure enables price discovery in a decentralized market.

AB This article considers a classical linear simultaneous equations model
   with random coefficients on the endogenous variables. Simultaneous
   equations models are used to study social interactions, strategic
   interactions between firms, and market equilibrium. Random coefficient
   models allow for heterogeneous marginal effects. I show that random
   coefficient seemingly unrelated regression models with common regressors
   are not point identified, which implies random coefficient simultaneous
   equations models are not point identified. Important features of these
   models, however, can be identified. For two-equation systems, I give two
   sets of sufficient conditions for point identification of the
   coefficients' marginal distributions conditional on exogenous
   covariates. The first allows for small support continuous instruments
   under tail restrictions on the distributions of unobservables which are
   necessary for point identification. The second requires full support
   instruments, but allows for nearly arbitrary distributions of
   unobservables. I discuss how to generalize these results to many
   equation systems, where I focus on linear-in-means models with
   heterogeneous endogenous social interaction effects. I give sufficient
   conditions for point identification of the distributions of these
   endogenous social effects. I propose a consistent nonparametric kernel
   estimator for these distributions based on the identification arguments.
   I apply my results to the Add Health data to analyse peer effects in
   education.

AB Diverse identities coexisting within the same society are often viewed

   argues that different types of social diversity have differential

   increases prospects for democracy while religious diversity decreases
   prospects for democracy. The article presents a variety of reasons why
   diversity might have divergent causal effects on regime type.
   Cross-national regressions in a variety of econometric formats -

AB Why do repeated elections often fail to curb governmental corruption,
   even in full democracies? While much of the comparative literature on
   corruption focuses on the institutional features of democracies, this
   article argues that party system institutionalization is an additional
   and neglected factor in explaining why corruption may persist in the
   context of democratic elections. Under-institutionalized party systems
   impede accountability. They compromise the capacity of voters to
   attribute responsibility and undermine electoral co-ordination to punish
   incumbents for corruption. These expectations are tested by combining a
   controlled comparative study of eighty democracies around the world with
   an examination of the causal process in a case study of Panama. The
   findings suggest that party system institutionalization powerfully
   shapes the scope for governmental corruption.

AB This article considers the emergence of an informal institution vital to

   accounts of its timing: a procedural' theory wherein the Shadow Cabinet
   is a solution to internal organizational issues in the House of Commons
   prior to widespread working-class voting, and a competition' theory that
   predicts that suffrage extension acts as a key stimulus for Shadow
   Cabinet organization. Gathering a dataset of almost a million utterances
   in parliament between the First and Fourth Reform Acts, the study
   provides a novel method of identifying Shadow Cabinet members using the
   surges in term use from their speeches. It finds that the competition'
   hypothesis is the most plausible version of events, and that the
   opposition responded to the new "party-orientated electorate' by
   strategically reorganizing in a way that mimicked the cabinet's
   structure.

AB Radical Right Parties (RRPs) consistently attract more male than female
   voters. Puzzlingly, there is no equally consistent gender difference in
   policy preferences on the main issues of these parties - immigration and
   minority integration policies. Indeed, in some countries, for instance
   the UK, women have as restrictive immigration policy preferences as men,
   but are still less likely to vote for RRPs. This article proposes a
   novel answer to this gender gap puzzle that emphasizes the normative
   conflicts about prejudice and discrimination that surround RRPs across
   Europe. It uses representative survey data to show, for the first time,
   that women are more likely than men to be motivated to control
   prejudice, and that this difference in motivations has political
   consequences. More specifically, the study demonstrates that the higher
   prevalence of internal motivation to control prejudice among women
   accounts for the gender gap in voting for RRPs that become trapped in
   conflicts over discrimination and prejudice. Voting patterns for RPPs
   that have been able to defuse normative concerns about prejudice, such
   as the Progress Party currently in government in Norway, are different.

   Using multi-wave panel survey data from Germany and Great Britain, this

AB In many contemporary urban spaces, political information accrues to high

   information-rich and information-poor each talk primarily with others
   like themselves. When information is specific and broadly diffused
   through the media, however, the convenience and low cognitive costs of
   everyday conversation could be especially helpful for the disadvantaged.
   This article shows how political conversations intensify or ameliorate
   spatial knowledge gaps, using a six-wave panel survey in fifty Brazilian
   neighborhoods between 2002 and 2006. Multilevel models demonstrate that
   conversation was more frequent in high education neighborhoods, but had
   a greater impact on specific, factual knowledge in low-education
   neighborhoods, leading to shrinking knowledge gaps. However,
   conversation slightly widened spatial gaps in socially perceived general

AB Studies of political budget cycles in developing countries have
   generally sought to inform understanding of short-term fiscal dynamics,
   but can also offer unique insight into broader political dynamics in
   developing countries. This article correspondingly employs markedly
   improved data in order to study the impact of elections on tax
   collection, and draw broader lessons. It shows that while elections as a
   group have had no significant effect on tax collection, the subset of
   competitive elections has had a significant negative impact on
   pre-election tax collection; while this effect appears to be largest
   where incumbents are particularly unpopular. This provides powerful
   evidence that the impact of elections on political incentives in
   developing countries is conditioned by the existence of an electorally
   competitive opposition, while offering preliminary evidence that popular
   resistance to taxation by unpopular governments may be an important
   means by which taxpayers may generate pressure for improved governance.

   election violence reflect changes in the strategic setting over the

   collective action tends to be focused on the election itself, either
   through voter mobilization or opposition-organized election boycotts. In
   the post-election period, by contrast, when a favorable electoral
   outcome is no longer a possibility, anti-government collective action
   more often takes the form of mass political protest, which in turn can
   lead to costly repercussions for incumbent leaders.

AB This study addresses what it means, theoretically and diplomatically, to
   argue that states anticipate war. The steps-to-war' thesis contends that
   territorial disputes are high salience issues, but war is relatively
   unlikely unless state policies, such as arms buildups, directly increase
   the probability of war. This framework contrasts with the argument that
   these policies simply reflect underlying conflict, seen as the primary
   cause of both policies and war. The historical analysis here indicates
   that states do anticipate' war, but, at least in the case of wars
   related to ongoing territorial conflicts, it is theoretically trivial:
   states anticipate war, engaging in final preparations after their
   relations have deteriorated over time, and the process occurs in ways
   predicted by the steps-to-war theory.

   The recently established Universal Periodic Review (UPR) operating under

   recommendations suggests that the deliberative processes surrounding the
   UPR do indeed evoke co-operative responses even from countries with poor

   and peer-to-peer nature can serve as a model for how international

AB Dedicated research on ideology has proliferated over the last few
   decades. Many different disciplines and methodologies have sought to
   make a contribution, with the welcome consequence that specialist
   thinking about ideology is at a high-water mark of richness, diversity
   and theoretical sophistication. Yet this proliferation of research has
   fragmented the study of ideology by producing independent communities of
   scholars differentiated by geographical location and by disciplinary
   attachment. This review draws together research on ideology from several
   disciplines on different sides of the Atlantic, in order to address
   three questions that appear to be of great relevance to political
   scientists: (1) What do we mean by ideology? (2) How do we model
   ideology? (3) Why do people adopt the ideologies they do? In doing so,
   it argues that many important axes of debate cut across disciplinary and
   geographic boundaries, and points to a series of significant
   intellectual convergences that offer a framework for productive
   interdisciplinary engagement and integration.

AB In the past few decades new laws criminalizing certain transnational
   activities have proliferated: from money laundering, corruption, and
   insider trading to trafficking in weapons and drugs. Human trafficking
   is one example. We argue that criminalization of trafficking in persons
   has diffused in large part because of the way the issue has been framed:
   primarily as a problem of organized crime rather than predominantly an
   egregious human rights abuse. Framing human trafficking as an organized
   crime practice empowers states to confront cross-border human movements
   viewed as potentially threatening. We show that the diffusion of
   criminalization is explained by road networks that reflect potential
   vulnerabilities to the diversion of transnational crime. We interpret
   our results as evidence of the importance of context and issue framing,
   which in turn affects perceptions of vulnerability to neighbors' policy
   choices. In doing so, we unify diffusion studies of liberalization with
   the spread of prohibition regimes to explain the globalization of
   aspects of criminal law.

AB Studies of the link between housework and sex sometimes reach divergent
   conclusions-partly resulting from varying perspectives on this
   relationship. We identify three perspectives found in prior studies of
   housework and sex-temporal, distributional, and fairness-each reflecting
   a different view of the processes linking these two domestic realms. To
   contribute to this literature, we examine housework measures reflecting
   each perspective. Negative binomial and OLS regression models using data
   from the National Survey of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS 2,
   2004-2006) reveal that housework measures reflecting the fairness and
   distributional perspectives are significantly associated with sexual
   satisfaction but not frequency. Lower sexual satisfaction is associated
   with wives' greater investment in housework than husbands' and the view
   of housework arrangements as unfair to wives. These findings, which held
   for wives and husbands, suggest that the inequitable, and gendered,
   housework arrangements of many heterosexual married couples may
   negatively affect their sex lives. Measures reflecting the temporal
   perspective are associated with neither sexual satisfaction nor
   frequency. Our findings are derived from an older sample than those used
   in most prior studies of this topic, raising the possibility that some
   processes linking housework and sex change as individuals age and their
   relationships lengthen.

AB Nonwestern secularization has the reputation of an elitist project, but
   poetry milieus in 20th-century Turkey experienced secularization in a
   relatively inclusive manner. Using comparative-historical, network, and
   statistical methods, this article compares poetry milieus to novelistic
   milieus, whose secularization closely resembles the Turkish/Islamic
   stereotype. This exercise identifies a previously unnoticed role that
   interaction dynamics play in shaping secularization patterns. As such,
   western-nonwestern difference as regards secularization is neither
   fiction nor fate: it involves structures of interaction that may appear
   anywhere. These findings suggest a more Simmelian direction for future
   scholarship, broadly affirming the ascendant culturalist orientation in
   the sociology of religion while revising some of its particular claims.
   They also call for a civic republican turn: while tempering past
   scholarship's vilification of the state, they suggest that a vibrant
   civil society is the more vital component of relatively inclusive
   secularization.

   to school digital skills they learn from each other. Comparative

   effectively discipline students' digital play but in different ways. At
   a school serving working-class Latino youth, students are told their
   digital expressions are irrelevant to learning; at a school with mostly
   middle-class Asian American youth, students' digital expressions are
   seen as threats to their ability to succeed academically; and at a
   private school with mainly wealthy white youth, students' digital skills
   are positioned as essential to school success. Insofar as digital
   competency represents a kind of cultural capital, the minority and
   working-class students also have that capital. But theirs is not

AB In this article, we address whether and how contemporary social classes
   are marked by distinct lifestyles. We assess the model of the social
   space, a novel approach to class analysis pioneered by Bourdieu's
   Distinction. Although pivotal in Bourdieu's work, this model is too
   often overlooked in later research, making its contemporary relevance
   difficult to assess. We redress this by using the social space as a
   framework through which to study the cultural manifestation of class
   divisions in lifestyle differences in contemporary Norwegian society.
   Through a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) of unusually rich
   survey data, we reveal a structure strikingly similar to the model in
   Distinction, with a primary dimension of the volume of capital, and a
   secondary dimension of the composition of capital. While avoiding the
   substantialist fallacy of predefined notions of highbrow' and lowbrow'
   tastes, we explore how 168 lifestyle items map onto this social space.
   This reveals distinct classed lifestyles according to both dimensions of
   the social space. The lifestyles of the upper classes are distinctly
   demanding in terms of resources. Among those rich in economic capital,
   this manifests itself in a lifestyle which involves a quest for
   excitement, and which is bodily oriented and expensive. For their
   counterparts rich in cultural capital, a more ascetic and intellectually
   oriented lifestyle manifests itself, demanding of resources in the sense
   of requiring symbolic mastery, combining a taste for canonized,
   legitimate culture with more cosmopolitan and popular' items. In
   contrast to many studies' descriptions of the lower classes as
   disengaged' and inactive', we find evidence of distinct tastes on their
   part. Our analysis thus affirms the validity of Bourdieu's model of
   social class and the contention that classes tend to take the form of
   status groups. We challenge dominant positions in cultural
   stratification research, while questioning the aptness of the metaphor
   of the omnivore', as well as recent analyses of emerging cultural
   capital'.

AB One of the main objectives of empirical analysis of experiments and
   quasi-experiments is to inform policy decisions that determine the
   allocation of treatments to individuals with different observable
   covariates. We study the properties and implementation of the Empirical
   Welfare Maximization (EWM) method, which estimates a treatment
   assignment policy by maximizing the sample analog of average social
   welfare over a class of candidate treatment policies. The EWM approach
   is attractive in terms of both statistical performance and practical
   implementation in realistic settings of policy design. Common features
   of these settings include: (i) feasible treatment assignment rules are
   constrained exogenously for ethical, legislative, or political reasons,
   (ii) a policy maker wants a simple treatment assignment rule based on
   one or more eligibility scores in order to reduce the dimensionality of
   individual observable characteristics, and/or (iii) the proportion of
   individuals who can receive the treatment is a priori limited due to a
   budget or a capacity constraint. We show that when the propensity score
   is known, the average social welfare attained by EWM rules converges at
   least at n(-1/2) rate to the maximum obtainable welfare uniformly over a
   minimally constrained class of data distributions, and this uniform
   convergence rate is minimax optimal. We examine how the uniform
   convergence rate depends on the richness of the class of candidate
   decision rules, the distribution of conditional treatment effects, and
   the lack of knowledge of the propensity score. We offer easily
   implementable algorithms for computing the EWM rule and an application
   using experimental data from the National JTPA Study.

AB In this paper, we develop algorithms to independently draw from a family
   of conjugate posterior distributions over the structural
   parameterization when sign and zero restrictions are used to identify
   structural vector autoregressions (SVARs). We call this family of
   conjugate posteriors normal-generalized-normal. Our algorithms draw from
   a conjugate uniform-normal-inverse-Wishart posterior over the orthogonal
   reduced-form parameterization and transform the draws into the
   structural parameterization; this transformation induces a
   normal-generalized-normal posterior over the structural
   parameterization. The uniform-normal-inverse-Wishart posterior over the
   orthogonal reduced-form parameterization has been prominent after the
   work of Uhlig (2005). We use Beaudry, Nam, and Wang's (2011) work on the
   relevance of optimism shocks to show the dangers of using alternative
   approaches to implementing sign and zero restrictions to identify SVARs
   like the penalty function approach. In particular, we analytically show
   that the penalty function approach adds restrictions to the ones
   described in the identification scheme.

   individual fixed effects. Our approach is based on cyclic monotonicity,
   which is a defining convex-analytic feature of the random utility
   framework underlying multinomial choice models. From the cyclic

   requiring any shape restrictions for the distribution of the random

   straightforward assumptions on the covariates. We propose a consistent

AB Social inequalities in health and human capital are core concerns of
   sociologists, but little research examines the developmental stage when
   such inequalities are likely to emerge-the transition to adulthood. With
   new data and innovative statistical methods, we conceptually develop,
   and empirically operationalize, pathways of physical health and human
   capital accumulation from adolescence into young adulthood, using an
   autoregressive cross-lagged structural equation model. Results reveal
   that pathways of health and human capital accumulate at differential
   rates across the transition to adulthood; evidence of cross-lagged
   effects lends support for both social causation and health selection
   hypotheses. We then apply this model to assess the presence of social
   inequality in metabolic syndrome-the leading risk factor of
   cardiovascular disease in the United States. Findings document social
   stratification of cardiovascular health that is robust to both observed
   and unobserved social and health selection mechanisms. We speculate that
   this social stratification will only increase as this cohort ages.

AB While scholars are giving greater attention than previously to sexual
   assault against women, they have ignored the fact that men report
   unwanted sex as well. This article examines thirty-nine heterosexual
   men's narratives about their experience of unwanted sex in college. My
   analysis of these data shows how unwanted sex with women is
   interactionally produced through a process where men seek to save face
   and to make sense to others. Unwanted sex relates not only to
   interactional processes, but also to the content of what is considered
   acceptable behavior in heterosexual interactions. That is, cultural
   norms governing gender provide the content for what allows a man to save
   face and for his actions to make sense to a female partner. In
   particular, men consent to unwanted sex because accepting all
   opportunities for sexual activity is a widely accepted way to perform
   masculinity. Findings also show that men conduct their sex lives in the
   shadow of presumed gendered reputational consequences. They fear
   ridicule if stories are told portraying them as the kind of man who does
   not jump at any opportunity for sex with an attractive woman. Moreover,
   it seems that women, as arbitrators of men's sense of self, may play an
   important role in policing masculinity and upholding gender
   expectations, at least in undergraduate sexual cultures. Amidst current
   attention to sexual assault on college campuses, I argue for a closer
   look at the importance of interaction and the implicit gendered rules of
   what is considered acceptable and masculine in heterosexual interaction.

AB Proponents of the devaluation hypothesis claim that occupations
   experiencing a significant inflow of female workers are devalued, both
   in status and in pay. We suggest that devaluation is an essentially
   cultural phenomenon that can be subject to change over time and that is
   not constant with varying contexts. Our theoretical model connects
   changing gender compositions in occupations with the formation of
   occupational gender stereotypes. In combination with a cultural bias
   that attributes less value to female work, these stereotypes can lead to
   devaluation. This is a novel view on the mechanics at play in the
   devaluation process. With US census data from 1960 to 2010, we show that
   devaluation was restricted to sometimes very specific contexts. A trend
   toward declining or disappearing devaluation is observed over the entire
   time span. Given potential cultural inertia and the stability of
   stereotypes, this result could, however, be an artifact of a deficient
   testing strategy that focuses solely on changes in occupational gender
   compositions without taking into account the normative power of the
   past.

   shifter. We then develop a tractable estimation procedure and apply it
   to Cambridge. Estimates suggest that while 83% of students are assigned
   to their stated first choice, only 72% are assigned to their true first
   choice because students avoid ranking competitive schools. Assuming that

AB This paper studies the behavioral foundations of non-Bayesian models of
   learning over social networks and develops a taxonomy of conditions for
   information aggregation in a general framework. As our main behavioral
   assumption, we postulate that agents follow social learning rules that
   satisfy imperfect recall, according to which they treat the current
   beliefs of their neighbors as sufficient statistics for the entire
   history of their observations. We augment this assumption with various
   restrictions on how agents process the information provided by their
   neighbors and obtain representation theorems for the corresponding
   learning rules (including the canonical model of DeGroot). We then
   obtain general long-run learning results that are not tied to the
   learning rules' specific functional forms, thus identifying the
   fundamental forces that lead to learning, non-learning, and mislearning
   in social networks. Our results illustrate that, in the presence of
   imperfect recall, long-run aggregation of information is closely linked
   to (i) the rate at which agents discount their neighbors' information
   over time, (ii) the curvature of agents' social learning rules, and
   (iii) whether their initial tendencies are amplified or moderated as a
   result of social interactions.

AB Recent evidence suggests that investors are inattentive to their
   portfolios and hire expensive portfolio managers. This paper develops a
   life-cycle portfolio-choice model in which the investor experiences
   loss-averse utility over news and can ignore his portfolio. In such a
   model, the investor prefers to ignore and not rebalance his portfolio
   most of the time because he dislikes bad news more than he likes good
   news such that expected news causes a first-order decrease in utility.
   Consequently, the investor has a first-order willingness to pay a
   portfolio manager who rebalances actively on his behalf. Moreover, the
   investor can diversify over time and his consumption aligns with
   predictions of mental accounting. I structurally estimate the preference
   parameters by matching stock shares and stock-market non-participation
   over the life cycle. My parameter estimates are in line with the
   literature, generate reasonable intervals of inattention, and
   simultaneously explain consumption and wealth accumulation over the life
   cycle. Here, it matters that news utility preserves first-order risk
   aversion even in the presence of stochastic labor income, which also
   causes stock shares to rise in wealth.

   coefficient in a linear or partly linear regression. Our main assumption
   is that the regression function is known to lie in a convex function
   class, which covers most smoothness and/or shape assumptions used in
   econometrics. We derive finite-sample optimal CIs and sharp efficiency
   bounds under normal errors with known variance. We show that these
   results translate to uniform (over the function class) asymptotic
   results when the error distribution is not known. When the function
   class is centrosymmetric, these efficiency bounds imply that minimax CIs
   are close to efficient at smooth regression functions. This implies, in
   particular, that it is impossible to form CIs that are substantively
   tighter using data-dependent tuning parameters, and maintain coverage
   over the whole function class. We specialize our results to inference on

AB We document that consumption growth rates are far from i.i.d. and have a
   highly persistent component. First, we estimate univariate and
   multivariate models of cash-flow (consumption, output, dividends) growth
   that feature measurement errors, time-varying volatilities, and
   mixed-frequency observations. Monthly consumption data are important for
   identifying the stochastic volatility process; yet the data are
   contaminated, which makes the inclusion of measurement errors essential
   for identifying the predictable component. Second, we develop a novel
   state-space model for cash flows and asset prices that imposes the
   pricing restrictions of a representative-agent endowment economy with
   recursive preferences. To estimate this model, we use a particle MCMC
   approach that exploits the conditional linear structure of the
   approximate equilibrium. Once asset return data are included in the
   estimation, we find even stronger evidence for the persistent component
   and are able to identify three volatility processes: the one for the
   predictable cash-flow component is crucial for asset pricing, whereas
   the other two are important for tracking the data. Our model generates
   asset prices that are largely consistent with the data in terms of
   sample moments and predictability features. The state-space approach
   allows us to track over time the evolution of the predictable component,
   the volatility processes, the decomposition of the equity premium into
   risk factors, and the variance decomposition of asset prices.

   Econometrically, we show that this assumption acts as an exclusion
   restriction. Under the Ramsey Exclusion Restriction (RER), a single tax
   reform can serve to simultaneously identify the demand and supply
   elasticity. We develop an estimation method, which includes 2SLS
   estimators for the elasticities, and a test for strength of the
   instrument. We discuss possible applications.

AB Why do some countries fail to govern their territory? Incomplete
   domestic sovereignty, defined as the absence of effective state
   authority over territory, has severe consequences in terms of security,
   order, economic growth, and human well-being. These negative
   consequences raise the question of why such spaces remain without
   effective authority. While the international relations literature
   suggests that state weakness persists because of an absence of war and
   the comparative politics literature treats political underdevelopment as
   the consequence of domestic factors that raise the costs of exercising
   authority, these views are incomplete. I argue that hostile neighbors
   weaken state authority over territory through a strategy of foreign
   interference. Foreign interference in domestic sovereignty is a powerful
   instrument of statecraft that can yield domestic and foreign policy
   benefits. I investigate the effects of hostile neighboring states
   through a cross-national, within-country statistical analysis utilizing
   a novel indicator of state authority, and pair this analysis with a
   qualitative case study of Malaysian subversion of the Philippines in the
   1970s. Together, this evidence shows how this international factor is an
   underappreciated yet important contributor to weak state authority even
   after accounting for domestic factors. The study's conclusions challenge
   our understanding of the effects of international politics on internal
   political development.

   origins of Common Article 3, demonstrating the importance of social
   opprobrium pressure to explain why Britain and France switched from
   staunch opposition to support and leadership in 1949. Specifically,
   forum isolation pressured these European empires to concede and to react
   strategically behind the scenes, saving face and safeguarding their
   security interests by deliberately inserting ambiguous language in the
   text of Common Article 3. This move later facilitated states' avoidance
   of this rule in many conflict cases.

AB The most important international human rights norms are legalized or
   codified in international treaty law. Yet pernicious practices at odds
   with these norms endure and sometimes even increase after legalization.
   According to conventional wisdom, this is because agents commit to but
   do not comply with international law and the underlying norms. I develop
   a theory of evasion to explain why norm violations persist even when
   states technically comply with the law. Because legalization transposes
   social norms into international law imperfectly, it creates gaps between
   laws and underlying norms. Because of these norm-law gaps, legality and
   normative appropriateness will diverge. States caught between opposing
   pressures from pro-violation and pro-compliance groups exploit this gap
   through what I call evasionthe intentional minimization of normative
   obligations that technically complies with international law but
   violates underlying norms. I demonstrate the theory's empirical purchase
   in the cases of the French expulsion of Roma immigrants and the Czech
   school segregation of Roma children. Under the cover of technical
   compliance with the law, these states violated the norm of racial
   equality. The argument cautions that the good news about law compliance
   is not necessarily good news about norm compliance, broadens our
   understanding of norm violators' agency, and has practical implications
   for human rights advocacy.

AB Do legal amnesties for combatants help end civil wars? International
   policy experts often take it for granted that amnesties promote
   negotiated settlements with rebels. However, a large number of amnesties
   are followed by continued fighting or a return to the battlefield. What,
   then, are the factors that make amnesties effective or ineffective? In
   this article I use a disaggregated data set of all amnesties enacted in
   the context of internal war since 1946 to evaluate a bargaining theory
   of amnesties and peace. Testing hypotheses about conflict patterns using
   models that account for selection, I find that (1) only amnesties passed
   following conflict termination help resolve civil wars, (2) amnesties
   are more effective when they are embedded in peace agreements, and (3)
   amnesties that grant immunity for serious rights violations have no
   observable pacifying effects. These policy-relevant findings represent a
   new breakthrough in an ossified peace versus justice debate pitting
   security specialists against global human rights advocates.

AB Power sharing, in which elites from rival societal groups agree to share
   control of the central government, is a key source of domestic peace,
   enabling states to escape devastating cycles of exclusion and civil war.
   Yet the conditions giving rise to inclusive governance are not well
   understood. In contrast to existing scholarship that emphasizes the
   importance of external third-party mediation or strong formal
   institutions, we point to the structural roots of power sharing in which
   political inclusion stems from the distribution of societal power and
   the balance of threat capabilities it produces. Only when both the
   ruling group and a given rival group possess strong mobilizational
   capabilities, such that each could credibly threaten to recapture state
   power if excluded from the central government, does self-enforcing power
   sharing emerge. A strong rival induces the ruler to commit to power
   sharing and to reluctantly accept coup risk over civil war risk. The
   ruling group's own threat capabilities, in turn, constrain rivals from
   trying to convert their share of power into absolute power. Supported by
   extensive quantitative and qualitative evidence with particular
   reference to weak states in sub-Saharan Africa, we shed light on the
   conditions under which the distribution of violence within a state
   underwrites a peaceful and productive equilibrium. In doing so, we
   rethink how scholars approach the study of civil war. Rather than
   conceiving of it in terms of effective resistance, we model civil war as
   a contest for state power shaped by groups' capabilities to project
   force in the capital.

AB From 1960 to 2000, manufacturing supply chains became global. To what

   Using data on public positions of US firms and trade associations on all

   (FDI) and input sourcing are the primary drivers of support for trade
   liberalization. Direct import competition and export opportunities play
   a secondary role in shaping support for free trade agreements. This work
   therefore adds to the literature on the politics of globalization by

AB The links between protests and state responses have taken on increased
   visibility in light of the Arab Spring movements. But we still have
   unanswered questions about the relationship between protest behaviors
   and responses by the state. We frame this in terms of concession and
   disruption costs. Costs are typically defined as government behaviors
   that impede dissidents' capacity for collective action. We change this
   causal arrow and hypothesize how dissidents can generate costs that
   structure the government's response to a protest. By disaggregating
   costs along dimensions of concession and disruption we extend our
   understanding of protest behaviors and the conditions under which they
   are more (or less) effective. Utilizing a new cross-national
   protest-event data set, we test our theoretical expectations against
   protests from 1990 to 2014 and find that when protesters generate high
   concession costs, the state responds in a coercive manner. Conversely,
   high disruption costs encourage the state to accommodate demands. Our
   research provides substantial insights and inferences about the dynamics
   of government response to protest.

   demonstrate that regardless of one's physical size, those residing in
   counties with a heavier weight norm are significantly less likely to see
   themselves as overweight than those residing in counties with a light
   weight norm. We further show that the local weight norm during
   adolescence (Wave 1) is associated with individuals' weight perceptions
   through adolescence and into young adulthood (Wave 4), though these
   associations attenuate in strength as respondents age. Our results
   suggest that weight norms have a stronger influence on weight
   perceptions among women compared to men, and that the role of gender is
   particularly important during adolescence. We encourage life course
   researchers to consider the normative health environment during
   adolescence as an important context for understanding disparities in

AB Social scientists have long recognized that college students from
   lower-income households have lower college completion rates than their
   more affluent peers who are attending the very same schools. Yet parsing
   the mechanisms through which relative socioeconomic disadvantage and
   privilege influence college completion has been difficult. This paper
   leverages a novel dataset comprising information from the Integrated
   Postsecondary Education Data System, the Education Trust Pell
   Partnership, and the U.S. News and World Report to investigate the
   potential influence of Greek letter societies (i.e., fraternities and
   sororities) on gaps in completion rates between Pell Grant recipients
   and non-Pell, non-Stafford loan recipients. We find that at selective
   four-year schools, which tend to enroll students from a wide variety of
   class backgrounds, the presence of Greek letter societies is associated
   with greater class-based graduation gaps. The association is evident,
   but less significant, at the nation's most selective universities.
   Results suggest that both stratification researchers and higher
   education administrators should seriously consider the extra-academic
   features of college life as important mediators of social inequality.

AB Our understanding of cross-national differences in the relationship
   between social class location and voting choices has improved
   substantially in the last decade. Yet scholarship about cross-national
   and longitudinal variations in the relationship between class location
   and policy preferences remains neglected. This paper addresses this
   important gap in the literature through a comparative, longitudinal
   analysis of the substantial, cross-national variation of class
   differences in pro-redistribution attitudes. To explain this variation,
   we focus on the role of preexisting policies and engage with an ongoing
   debate in the policy feedbacks literature. The self-interest approach
   argues that higher redistribution creates incentives among the upper
   classes to oppose redistribution, widening the class cleavage. By
   contrast, the normative approach argues that universal social policy
   regimes meet the fairness criteria of middle and upper classes, thereby
   reducing attitudinal differences. Using an innovative data set
   containing 106 country-years between 1985 and 2010, our study supports
   the self-interest approach. Countries achieving more redistribution
   display larger class cleavages in pro-redistribution attitudes, while
   universalism does not reduce this divide. The study further shows that
   redistribution and class cleavage are linearly related because
   redistribution bolsters the already low commitment with inequality
   reduction in the upper service and lower service classes.

   workplace performance. Using FOIA-requested data from the Department of
   Defense, we follow 1.3 million ex-offender and non-offender enlistees in
   the US military from 2002 to 2009. Those with a felony background show
   no difference in attrition rates due to poor performance compared to
   those without criminal records. Moreover, exfelons are promoted more
   quickly and to higher ranks than other enlistees. At the same time, we
   find that ex-felons are slightly more likely to commit a legal offense
   in the military system (5 percent of non-felons compared to 6.6 percent
   of ex-felons). We also find a higher rate of work-related deaths among
   the ex-felon sample; closer evaluation of limited data suggests this may
   be driven by ex-felons being assigned more often to combat positions.
   Overall, our study shows that the military's criminal history screening
   process can result in successful employment outcomes for exfelons, at
   least in terms of job mobility and reliability, to the mutual benefit of
   employer and employee. An important question arising from this analysis
   is whether the military's "whole person" review can apply successfully
   to the civilian sector.

AB Return migrants engage in high rates of self-employment, which scholars
   commonly attribute to the accumulation of financial and human capital
   while working abroad. Central to this scholarship is the assumption that
   self- employment is positive and leads to upward economic mobility among
   return migrants. This scholarship is limited, however, because it relies
   on large surveys and cross-sectional census data that treat
   self-employment as a single unidimensional status measured at one point
   in time. To improve conceptualization and measurement of
   self-employment, we engage three bodies of research that have thus far
   had little cross-fertilization: the literature on work and
   self-employment in Latin America, the scholarship on return migration
   and self-employment, and developments in economic theories of
   international migration. Drawing on results from the first longitudinal
   analysis of the labor market trajectories of Mexican return migrants in
   a large urban area in central Mexico, we identify three types of
   self-employment-survivalist, temporary, and prosperous. To explain these
   divergent self-employment pathways, we draw on biographical narratives
   and identify two sets of mechanisms-human capital formation and
   life-course stage. Overall, our investigation of self-employment types
   suggests a complex relationship between international migration
   experiences and the labor market mobility of return migrants that cannot
   be understood without taking into consideration migrants' social and
   economic circumstances before, during, and after migration.
   Consequently, our study yields insights into economic theories of
   international migration and provides direction for future research on
   return migration and labor market reintegration.

AB The study of foreign-local encounters is at the heart of much of social
   scientific research, from the dynamics of globalized travel and
   migration to the study of colonialism and places of foreign control.
   These interactions are often both shaped by structural inequalities and
   fleeting. How do organizations shape these interactions? This question
   of how organizations interact with their environment is a central puzzle
   that motivates the field of organizational studies. Yet most research
   assumes that organizations are, or intend to be, permanent. What about
   transient organizations, those that neither have nor intend to have a
   permanent presence? How do these types of organizations shape
   foreign-local interactions? Using qualitative interviews, documents, and
   ethnographic observations, I argue that Goffman's work on total
   institutions is useful for understanding this question in cases where
   transient organizations are self-sustaining. Examining a US military
   ship and an evangelical missionary ship docked at the Subic Bay Freeport
   Zone, Philippines, I show how a ship's total institutional form and
   logics shape-or affect-foreign-local encounters in three ways, by: (1)
   gendering the geography of the host community, (2) perpetuating
   stereotypes, and (3) influencing local markets. By shifting scholarly
   focus from the dynamics of permanent organizations to the intended and
   unintended consequences of transient total institutions, I reveal how
   transient actors can have profound effects on social life. Given the
   proliferation of ships around the world, my findings have broader
   implications beyond the two I study.

AB For decades, educational scholars have claimed that public schools are

   schools create the coupling structure. Recent federal policies have
   centralized the public education system, but state laws, districts, and
   principals still play a prominent role in shaping the organization of
   schools. In this paper, I investigate how the multiple tiers of the
   public education system influence the coupling structures of schools.
   Utilizing all seven waves of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), I
   rely on OLS regression to analyze how couplings emerge within schools.
   Findings suggest three major influences on coupling within schools.
   First, federal policies have had a non-linear effect on school-level
   coupling. Second, the relationship between the district and the school
   affects school-level coupling. Finally, principals play a key role in
   shaping the coupling within the school, and coupling is a gendered
   process.

AB Incarceration intensely alters the family lives of incarcerated men and
   the women and children connected to them. Yet women increasingly spend
   time behind bars and, accordingly, they absorb direct consequences of
   incarceration in addition to the more commonly considered spillover
   consequences of men's incarceration on families. In this article, we
   draw on the stress process perspective to examine the consequences of
   maternal incarceration for three broad aspects of family life: romantic
   relationships, parenting, and economic wellbeing. Data from the Fragile
   Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 3,045), an urban sample that
   includes a relatively large number of mothers who spent time in jail or
   prison, and methodological strategies to account for spurious
   associations between maternal incarceration and family life, yield two
   important conclusions. First, maternal incarceration is a stressor that
   proliferates to engender chronic strains in family life. Second, many of
   these chronic strains are especially acute when maternal incarceration
   is accompanied by paternal incarceration. Taken together, these findings
   suggest that the stressor of maternal incarceration has reverberating
   consequences for family life.

AB The United States witnessed a dramatic expansion of the penal state from
   the 1970s to the Great Recession of 2008. One key puzzle is why penal
   state growth continued unabated long after crime levels peaked in the
   early 1990s. We focus on local policing and consider the relationship
   between growing city-level law enforcement expenditures and two shifts:
   first, the move toward an economy increasingly organized around
   residential real estate; and second, city-level welfare retrenchment. We
   argue that increasing economic reliance on housing price appreciation
   during the late 1990s and the 2000s heightened demand for expanded law
   enforcement even as actual risks of crime victimization fell. At the
   same time, cities increasingly addressed social problems through
   criminal justice-rather than social service-capacities. We assess these
   arguments using a dataset of 171 cities' police expenditures between
   1992 and 2010. Results of a dynamic panel model indicate that places
   with more pronounced reliance on housing price growth and mortgage
   investment exhibited correspondingly greater growth of local law
   enforcement, as did places with decreased social service spending.

AB Previous studies of maternal employment have focused on marital status
   differences, but the rise in nonmarital cohabiting parenthood
   problematizes the simple dichotomy between married and unmarried
   mothers. Theory and previous research yield mixed predictions as to
   whether cohabiting mothers' employment will more closely resemble that
   of married mothers or lone unmarried mothers. Using data from the
   Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, I examine how maternal
   employment varies across family structures (married parents, cohabiting
   unmarried parents, and lone unmarried mothers) in the five years after a
   birth for mothers living in urban areas in the United States.
   Descriptive statistics show few differences in maternal employment
   patterns by family structure. Controlling for human capital, however, I
   find that cohabiting mothers return to work earlier and work more than
   married mothers. Cohabiting mothers and lone mothers show very similar
   employment patterns. Additionally, cohabiting mothers who later marry
   have employment trajectories that are similar to married mothers,
   whereas married mothers who divorce increase their employment hours.
   Family characteristics, partner characteristics, and gender attitudes do
   not explain employment differences between married and cohabiting
   mothers. I speculate that cohabiting mothers work more than married
   mothers as a hedge against economic deprivation given high union
   dissolution rates for cohabiting couples.

AB It remains unclear to what extent shifts in gender attitudes are
   products of changes in micro-level characteristics, macro-level social
   transformations, or net cohort and period transitions. We test these
   questions on 20 waves of data from the General Social Survey, 1977-2016
   (N = 45,125). Compositional change in individual characteristics
   accounts for almost 78 percent of the cohort variation in gender
   attitudes, but only 32 percent of the historical transformations. Macro
   dynamics are responsible for an additional 60 percent of the historical
   change in gender attitudes. Two structural forces are associated with
   historical transitions in American gender attitudes: gender equality in
   the labor force and the rise of men's overwork. Each of these factors
   accounts for a significant proportion of the period variation in gender
   attitudes in our analysis, and the rise of men's overwork appears to
   account for the puzzle of the "stalled revolution" in the 1990s and its
   "restart" in the mid-2000s. The conservative swing in 1994-2004
   correlates with the rise of overwork, as the proportion of men who
   overwork soared during this period when traditional gender roles were
   reinforced.

AB Twenty-five years after the fall of the communist regimes, the gender
   gap in employment varies widely across Central and Eastern Europe. This
   study examines the societal-level reasons for this variation and
   assesses the impact of different dimensions of neoliberally minded
   "economic development" strategies on gender inequality. We focus on
   Central and Eastern Europe, a segment of the world not typically
   addressed in the literature on gender and development. We rely on the
   2008 and 2012 waves of the European Union Statistics on Income and
   Living Conditions survey as well as multiple macro-level data sources to
   analyze the association between development indicators, labor market
   context, social policy arrangements, and the gender employment gap. We
   find that typical growth indicators, global market integration, and
   social policy arrangements are not at all or only weakly associated with
   the gender employment gap in this region. Instead, the labor market
   context, specifically the degree of segregation and the size of the
   public and service sectors, are more important for shaping women's labor
   market opportunities relative to men's at both time points. Our findings
   contribute to the literature on the trade-offs between job segregation
   and aspects of gender inequality as well as to ongoing debates within
   the field of "gender and development" by pointing out important
   variations across regions.

AB The plethora of pathways leading to family formation decisions has made
   the causal assessment of the influence of politics and religion on
   marriage and fertility difficult. The authors exploit the unique
   opportunity offered by the emergence of a new political party in Turkey,
   and the electoral features of the country's majoritarian system, to
   estimate the effect of politics and religion on marriage and fertility.
   The AK Parti (Justice and Development Party), with an explicitly
   Islamist platform, won Turkish elections in 2002, taking both a
   pro-natalist and pro-family stance, with increasing welfare expenditures
   and an explicit neoliberal agenda on macroeconomic issues. The authors
   analyze the results of the 2004 local elections using a regression
   discontinuity design and show that fertility and marriage rates have
   been significantly higher in districts where the AK Parti won. They
   argue that increased local welfare provision is the main explanatory
   mechanism, also discussing other alternative and complementary
   mechanisms.

AB Personal relationships often facilitate credit transactions. However,
   existing research provides different expectations about whether personal
   ties prove detrimental or beneficial for lenders. Economic sociology
   highlights the advantages lenders accrue when they have personal ties
   with borrowers. Yet research from social psychology suggests that
   personal ties can be costly because lenders may escalate commitment to
   poor performers. This study uses data from a microfinance bank to ask,
   When are personal relationships detrimental or beneficial for lenders?
   It shows that lenders with personal ties to borrowers are less likely to
   cut those ties and their borrowers miss fewer payments. However, these
   trends vary with frequency of contract. When lenders and borrowers
   interact infrequently, lenders continue to show strong commitment, but
   borrowers become less compliant, creating potential problems for
   lenders. This study integrates theories from economic sociology and
   social psychology to offer a more nuanced, temporally informed
   understanding of personal ties in finance.

AB Sociological studies often emphasize the role of metrics in broader
   processes of convergence and homogenization. Yet numbers can take on
   different meanings depending on their contexts. This article focuses on
   the case of journalism, a field transformed by quantification in the
   form of clicks. Drawing on ethnographic material gathered at two news
   websitesone in New York, the other in Parisit documents important
   differences in the uses and meanings assigned to audience metrics in the
   United States and France. At the U.S. website, editors make significant
   decisions based on metrics, but staff journalists are relatively
   unconcerned by them. At the French website, however, editors are
   conflicted about metrics, but staff writers fixate on them. To
   understand these differences, this article analyzes how the trajectories
   of the U.S. and French journalistic fields affect newsroom dynamics. It
   shows how cultural differences can be reproduced at a time of
   technological convergence.

AB The past several decades have seen a decline in employment rates and
   labor force participation, particularly among low-skilled, minority men
   living in poor areas. As low-skill jobs disappear from poor places, how
   do marginalized job seekers navigate this landscape? Using over 8,000
   daily measures of search and work collected from smartphones distributed
   to 133 men recently released from prison, this article presents the
   concept of work as foraging, where people work a variety of extremely
   precarious opportunities that span across job types. Sequence analysis
   methods describe distinct patterns of search and work that unfold over
   time, where most people cease their search efforts after the first month
   and maintain a state of very irregular and varied work. Although there
   is substantial heterogeneity in patterns, foraging is a common strategy
   of survival work.

   a rest point that is consistent with equilibrium play. We draw on models

AB Field theorists have long insisted that research needs to pay attention
   to the particular properties of each field studied. But while much
   field-theoretical research is comparative, either explicitly or
   implicitly, scholars have only begun to develop the language for
   describing the dimensions along which fields can be similar to and
   different from each other. In this context, this paper articulates an
   agenda for the analysis of variable properties of fields. It discusses
   variation in the degree but also in the kind of field autonomy. It
   discusses different dimensions of variation in field structure: fields
   can be more or less contested, and more or less hierarchical. The
   structure of symbolic oppositions in a field may take different forms.
   Lastly, it analyses the dimensions of variation highlighted by research
   on fields on the sub- and transnational scale. Post-national analysis
   allows us to ask how fields relate to fields of the same kind on
   different scales, and how fields relate to fields on the same scale in
   other national contexts. It allows us to ask about the role resources
   from other scales play in structuring symbolic oppositions within
   fields. A more fine-tuned vocabulary for field variation can help us
   better describe particular fields and it is a precondition for
   generating hypotheses about the conditions under which we can expect to
   observe fields with specified characteristics.

AB For Bourdieu, the field of cultural production is comprised of an
   autonomous and a heteronomous sector. A heteronomous sector is one that
   is interpenetrated by the commercial field. I discuss an arena that,
   until recently, was part of the relatively autonomous sector in the
   field of cultural production - the supported arts sector in the United
   Kingdom - and argue that it became more heteronomous, due to the
   penetration by the state. Heteronomy due to the commercial field is
   present but secondary to, and driven by, the actions of the state.
   Political parties' attempts to diffuse and legitimate a particular
   economic ideology have led to state demands that arts institutions adopt
   neoliberal business practices in exchange for funding. Government giving
   to the arts, previously at arm's length, proved to be a Faustian bargain
   that demanded significant repayment in the form of lost autonomy.
   Coercive pressures from the state, enacted over time, show how the
   domination of one field over another can occur, even when the domination
   is resisted.

AB British sociologists have long been interested in youth sub-cultures.
   However British sociologists have tended to focus on working class
   subcultures and avoided engagement with exclusive sub-cultures of elite
   social groups. This article seeks to attend to this gap by examining the
   subculture of a British elite: ex-public school students at select
   universities in the UK in the twenty-first century. This group consists
   of a relatively small group of young adults, aged between 18 and 23, who
   attended public schools, especially one of the nine Clarendon schools
   (Eton, Winchester, Westminster, St. Paul's, Merchant Taylor's,
   Shrewsbury, Rugby, Harrow and Charterhouse), and were students at a
   selective group of British universities, primarily Oxford and Cambridge,
   Durham, Bristol, Exeter, Bath, Manchester, St Andrews and Edinburgh. The
   article examines the way in which this group has reconfigured and
   re-constituted itself in the face of globalizing challenges.
   Specifically, it examines the way in which participation of ex-public
   school students in events run by and under the patronage of the high
   street retailing company, Jack Wills, has played a galvanising role for
   this group in the last decade. The Jack Wills crowd is an example of how
   some young adults form exclusive social networks and reproduce
   prevailing forms of privilege. The social networks built around the Jack
   Wills subculture is likely to provide them with advantages in the job
   market through a prodigious network of connections and patrons. The Jack
   Wills subculture potentially contributions to the socio-economic
   reproduction of the higher professional middle classes.

AB Class relations have been proven to affect various aspects of social
   life, even in modern individualized societies. However, following claims
   on individualization and the so-called death of class' thesis, studying
   the subjective dimension of class - that is, the way individuals
   perceive of class relations and their own position within them - has
   gone out of style. We argue that even in equalized societies, subjective
   class perceptions may still influence attitudes and behaviour as they
   evolve to fit modern class relations. To explore the existence as well
   as structure and content of perceived social classes, this article
   investigates how people describe society and social groups in focus
   group discussions. We find that groups in different positions in terms
   of education and economy all tend to apply hierarchical class categories
   to describe Danish society, which is normally seen as one of the most
   equal societies and political systems in the world. In addition, we find
   that economic resources serve as a baseline for the hierarchical
   ordering, often supplemented with notions of education, lifestyle and/or
   occupational profile. Even though people are somewhat uncomfortable with
   the notion of class, their descriptions of Danish society and classes
   are surprisingly similar within and across groups. We conclude that not
   only do class relations matter; people are also highly aware of the
   existing classes and able to position themselves and others according to
   their notion of classes.

AB The study investigates inequalities in access to social capital based on
   social class origin and immigration background and examines the role of
   transnational ties in explaining these differences. Social capital is
   measured with a position generator methodology that separates between
   national and transnational contacts in a sample of young adults in
   Sweden with three parental backgrounds: at least one parent born in Iran
   or Yugoslavia, or two Sweden-born parents. The results show that having
   socioeconomically advantaged parents is associated with higher levels of
   social capital. Children of immigrants are found to have a greater
   access to social capital compared to individuals with native background,
   and the study shows that this is related to transnational contacts,
   parents' education and social class in their country of origin. Children
   of immigrants tend to have more contacts abroad, while there is little
   difference in the amount of contacts living in Sweden across the three
   groups. It is concluded that knowledge about immigration group resources
   help us predict its member's social capital, but that the analysis also
   needs to consider how social class trajectories and migration jointly
   structure national and transnational contacts.

AB In this paper we add to the existing evidence base on recent trends in

   from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (ONS-LS),
   which links individual records from the five decennial censuses between
   1971 and 2011. The ONS-LS is an excellent data resource for the study of
   social mobility because it has a very large sample size, excellent
   population coverage and low rates of nonresponse and attrition across
   waves. Additionally, the structure of the study means that we can
   observe the occupations of LS-members' parents when they were children
   and follow their own progress in the labour market at regular intervals
   into middle age. Counter to widespread prevailing beliefs, our results
   show evidence of a small but significant increase in social fluidity
   between 1950s and the 1980s for both men and women.

   long-range upward mobility (i.e. those who move from working class
   origin to salariat destination) tend to fare better than those who are
   immobile in the working class. Those who have experienced long-range
   downward mobility (moving from salariat origin to working class
   destination) do about as well as second-generation members of the
   working class. Overall, there is no support for Sorokin's thesis.

AB A key strand in the Western literature on working-class masculinities
   focuses on whether young men are capable of the feminized performances
   apparently required of them in new service economies. However, the wider
   literature on processes of neoliberalization - emphasizing the hollowing
   out' of labour markets, the cultural devaluation of lower-skilled forms
   of employment, and the pathologization of working-class lives - would
   suggest that it is as much a classed as a gendered transformation that
   is demanded of young men leaving school with few qualifications. This
   dimension of neoliberalization is highlighted by ethnographic data
   exploring the experiences and subjectivities of young workers in St
   Petersburg, Russia, where traditional forms of manual labour have not
   given way to feminized' work, but have become materially and
   symbolically impoverished, and are perceived as incapable of supporting
   the wider transition into adult independence. In this context, young
   workers attempt to emulate new forms of successful masculinity'
   connected with novel service sector professions and the emergent higher
   education system, despite the unlikelihood of overcoming a range of
   structural and cultural barriers. These acquiescent, individualized
   responses indicate that, while ways of being a man are apparently being
   liberated from old constraints amongst the more privileged,
   neoliberalization narrows the range of subject positions available to
   working-class young men.

   admissions increase out-of-pocket medical spending, unpaid medical

   and consumer borrowing. The earnings decline is substantial compared to
   the out-of-pocket spending increase, and is minimally insured prior to

AB This article explores the mechanisms by which corporate prestige
   produces distorted legal outcomes. Drawing on social psychological
   theories of status, we suggest that prestige influences audience
   evaluations by shaping expectations, and that its effect will differ
   depending on whether a firm's blameworthiness has been firmly
   established. We empirically analyze a unique database of more than 500
   employment discrimination suits brought between 1998 and 2008. We find
   that prestige is associated with a decreased likelihood of being found
   liable (suggesting a halo effect in assessments of blameworthiness), but
   with more severe punishments among organizations that are found liable
   (suggesting a halo tax in administrations of punishment). Our analysis
   allows us to reconcile two ostensibly contradictory bodies of work on
   how organizational prestige affects audience evaluations by showing that
   prestige can be both a benefit and a liability, depending on whether an
   organization's blameworthiness has been firmly established.

   This paper draws on a rich collection of Mexican microdata to estimate

   decomposes this effect into six channels. We find that foreign entry
   causes large welfare gains for the average household predominantly
   driven by a reduction in the cost of livingboth through price reductions
   at domestic stores and through the direct consumer gains from foreign
   stores. These gains are, on average, positive for all income groups but

   jail-or-release decisions that hinge on a prediction of what a defendant
   would do if released. The concreteness of the prediction task combined
   with the volume of data available makes this a promising
   machine-learning application. Yet comparing the algorithm to judges
   proves complicated. First, the available data are generated by prior
   judge decisions. We only observe crime outcomes for released defendants,
   not for those judges detained. This makes it hard to evaluate
   counterfactual decision rules based on algorithmic predictions. Second,
   judges may have a broader set of preferences than the variable the
   algorithm predicts; for instance, judges may care specifically about
   violent crimes or about racial inequities. We deal with these problems
   using different econometric strategies, such as quasi-random assignment
   of cases to judges. Even accounting for these concerns, our results
   suggest potentially large welfare gains: one policy simulation shows
   crime reductions up to 24.7% with no change in jailing rates, or jailing
   rate reductions up to 41.9% with no increase in crime rates. Moreover,
   all categories of crime, including violent crimes, show reductions;
   these gains can be achieved while simultaneously reducing racial
   disparities. These results suggest that while machine learning can be
   valuable, realizing this value requires integrating these tools into an
   economic framework: being clear about the link between predictions and
   decisions; specifying the scope of payoff functions; and constructing
   unbiased decision counterfactuals.

AB We explore the role of natural characteristics in determining the
   worldwide spatial distribution of economic activity, as proxied by
   lights at night, observed across 240,000 grid cells. A parsimonious set
   of 24 physical geography attributes explains 47% of worldwide variation
   and 35% of within-country variation in lights. We divide geographic
   characteristics into two groups, those primarily important for
   agriculture and those primarily important for trade, and confront a
   puzzle. In examining within-country variation in lights, among countries
   that developed early, agricultural variables incrementally explain over
   6 times as much variation in lights as do trade variables, while among
   late developing countries the ratio is only about 1.5, even though the
   latter group is far more dependent on agriculture. Correspondingly, the
   marginal effects of agricultural variables as a group on lights are
   larger in absolute value, and those for trade smaller, for early
   developers than for late developers. We show that this apparent puzzle
   is explained by persistence and the differential timing of technological
   shocks in the two sets of countries. For early developers, structural
   transformation due to rising agricultural productivity began when
   transport costs were still high, so cities were localized in
   agricultural regions. When transport costs fell, these agglomerations
   persisted. In late-developing countries, transport costs fell before
   structural transformation. To exploit urban scale economies,
   manufacturing agglomerated in relatively few, often coastal, locations.
   Consistent with this explanation, countries that developed earlier are
   more spatially equal in their distribution of education and economic
   activity than late developers.

AB What is the relationship between social class and online participation
   in social movements? Scholars suggest that low costs to digital activism
   broaden participation and challenge conventional collective action
   theories, but given the digital divide, little is known about cost
   variation across social movement organizations from different social
   classes. A focus on high levels of digital engagement and extraordinary
   events leaves scant information about the effect of social class on
   digital mobilization patterns and everyday practices within and across
   organizations. This study takes a field-level approach to incorporate
   all groups involved in one statewide political issue, thereby including
   organizations with different social class compositions, from Tea Parties
   to labor unions. Data collection spans online and off-line digital
   activism practices. With an index to measure digital engagement from an
   original data set of over 90,000 online posts, findings show deep
   digital activism inequalities between working-class and
   middle/upper-class groups. In-depth interviews and ethnographic
   observations reveal that the mechanisms of this digital activism gap are
   organizational resources, along with individual disparities in access,
   skills, empowerment and time. These factors create high costs of online
   participation for working-class groups. Rather than reduced costs
   equalizing online participation, substantial costs contribute to digital
   activism inequality.

   passively monitored hundreds of adult black men with syphilis despite
   the availability of effective treatment. The study's methods have become
   synonymous with exploitation and mistreatment by the medical profession.
   To identify the study's effects on the behavior and health of older
   black men, we use an interacted difference-in-difference-in-differences
   model, comparing older black men to other demographic groups, before and
   after the Tuskegee revelation, in varying proximity to the study's
   victims. We find that the disclosure of the study in 1972 is correlated
   with increases in medical mistrust and mortality and decreases in both
   outpatient and inpatient physician interactions for older black men. Our
   estimates imply life expectancy at age 45 for black men fell by up to
   1.5 years in response to the disclosure, accounting for approximately
   35% of the 1980 life expectancy gap between black and white men and 25%
   of the gap between black men and women.

AB Why do people maintain ties with individuals whom they find difficult?
   Standard network theories imply that such alters are avoided or dropped.
   Drawing on a survey of over 1,100 diverse respondents who described over
   12,000 relationships, we examined which among those ties respondents
   nominated as a person whom they sometimes find demanding or difficult.
   Those so listed composed about 15 percent of all alters in the network.
   After holding ego and alter traits constant, close kin, especially women
   relatives and aging parents, were especially likely to be named as
   difficult alters. Non-kin described as friends were less likely, and
   those described as co-workers more likely, to be listed only as
   difficult alters. These results suggest that normative and institutional
   constraints may force people to retain difficult and demanding alters in
   their networks. We also found that providing support to alters, but not
   receiving support from those alters, was a major source of difficulty in
   these relationships. Furthermore, the felt burden of providing support
   was not attenuated by receiving assistance, suggesting that alters
   involved in reciprocated exchanges were not less often labeled difficult
   than were those in unreciprocated ones. This study underlines the
   importance of constraints in personal networks.

AB Central to the contemporary American welfare state, nonprofits are
   increasingly squeezed between declining resources and a simultaneous
   peak in demand for services. Scholars have outlined a number of ways
   that nonprofits strategically respond to resource scarcity. Why
   nonprofits select particular strategies, however, is less clear. This
   article motivates a network membership perspective via a mixed-methods
   study of one food bank and its associated food pantries, wherein actors
   navigate competing network demands that are emblematic of those faced by
   other nonprofits. Food banks source food from three types of networks-a
   cartel-like network orchestrated by a national coordinating body, a
   peer-to-peer inter-food bank network, and a bureaucratic network
   anchored by the USDA-that place overlapping and conflicting constraints
   on the organizations. In combination, network demands entangle the food
   banks within a web of tensions that prevent many forms of adaptation
   while enabling others, a predicament I refer to in this article as
   network entrapment. How organizations navigate network demands has
   implications for the vitality of the organizations and the well-being of
   their beneficiaries. My results suggest that entrapment can lead to
   organizational burden and the adoption of neoliberal-inspired
   efficiencies, but also innovations that prioritize citizen rights over
   cost-benefit ratios.

AB Through a qualitative, extended case study of the National AIDS Memorial
   Grove (NAMG) in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the only federally
   designated AIDS memorial in the United States, this article investigates
   collective memory as an organizationally bounded process. After locating
   the case in the scholarship on collective memory conflicts, and on
   complex and reflexive memorials, I suggest that the NAMG highlights the
   interaction between impulses within collective memory work that stand in
   tension. In the political struggle over the what, why, who, and how of
   memorializing at the NAMG and elsewhere, we can see an encounter between
   the forces of resolution, fixity, and unitary voice and those of
   openness, reflexivity, and multivocality. In the case of the NAMG, the
   balance has interestingly tipped towards the latter, what I call
   flexible memory production: the NAMG operates with relatively broad,
   porous categories of "victims" and "survivors," and deliberately pursues
   nonlinear, fluid, decentered storytelling. My discussion then points to
   the conditions that enable and encourage such flexibility-the
   characteristics of the trauma itself; organizational conditions; and the
   features of memory technologies-and those that push back against it,
   within and beyond the Grove case. I conclude with a consideration of
   whether and how unsettled, mutable, flexible memory projects can be
   sustained over time.

AB Using a quasi-natural experiment in the Latino National Survey (2006), I
   examine the effect of the 2006 immigrant rights marches on attitudes
   about assimilation among Mexican immigrants residing in the United
   States. I test the hypothesis, dominant in the existing literature, that
   major sociopolitical events raise ethnic consciousness and lead to
   reactive or retentionist attitudes that privilege maintenance of ethnic
   culture over "blending in." Contrary to established findings, I show
   that the marches did not increase retentionist attitudes nor strengthen
   ethnic nationalism. Instead, in the period during and after the marches,
   Mexican immigrants were more likely to hold incorporationist attitudes
   that place value on both assimilation and ethnic cultural maintenance,
   as well as assimilationist attitudes which privilege "blending in" to
   American society. These findings suggest that attitudes were influenced
   by the incorporationist and assimilationist messages promulgated by
   protest organizers and the Spanish-language media. The specific
   discourse used by media and activists can shape both individual
   attitudes and conceptions of how minority groups relate to wider
   society, evincing a more expansive approach to American identity.

AB Scholars have documented strong anti-immigrant bias in mainstream media
   portrayals and public sentiment, especially associated with notions of
   "illegality." Yet certain groups of undocumented immigrants have been
   able to defend their continued residency. How are undocumented
   immigrants, as marginalized subjects, able to make claims for legal and
   social recognition? Through an analysis of 125 anti-deportation
   campaigns led by undocumented youth organizations in the United States,
   I show how organizations developed a nationally coordinated model using
   citizenship frames to challenge deportations and build support for
   pro-immigrant legislation. Citizenship frames are based in legal and
   normative ideologies of citizenship that underscore acculturation, civic
   engagement, and humanitarian concerns. The campaigns highlight
   undocumented immigrants' social integration, deservingness, and practice
   of citizenship, therefore contesting the boundaries between citizen and
   noncitizen, and between lawful and unlawful. Though citizenship frames
   are used across cases, campaign tactics vary: students are portrayed as
   high-achievers who would suffer greatly if deported, while campaigns for
   non-students emphasize the detrimental effects of deportation on others.
   Importantly, citizenship frames are bounded by the government's
   priorities for immigration enforcement, with potentially negative
   consequences for those immigrants considered less than model citizens.

AB This study extends segmented assimilation to post-deportation studies.
   Drawing from life history interviews with 96 deported Salvadoran men, it
   argues that deportees follow different paths to re/integration upon
   return. Divergent trajectories are explained by an interaction between
   the context of return (government policies, social reception, economic
   structure, and the deportee community), migrant characteristics
   (demographics, criminal and migratory histories, economic resources, and
   social ties), and agentic behavior. In El Salvador, national
   affiliations and perceptions of deportee criminality emerge as the best
   predictors of post-deportation outcomes. Deportees who grew up in El
   Salvador and remained connected to it while abroad (Salvadoran
   Nationals) encountered a relatively more favorable societal reception
   but faced a precarious economic situation. Conversely, deportees who
   spent significant time in the U.S. and continued identified with it
   prior to removal (U.S. Nationals) were highly stigmatized and
   criminalized upon return. U.S. nationals struggled to find employment
   and were targeted by police and gangs. Regardless of sociocultural and
   economic outcomes, both Salvadoran nationals and U.S. nationals longed
   to return to the U.S., especially if they had children abroad. The study
   affirms existing research claiming that mass deportation may slow but
   does not stop the migration cycle in the Americas. It also offers an
   analytical framework for future comparative post-deportation research.

AB Auctions were very popular in the early days of internet commerce, but

   between auctions and posted prices as a trade-off between competitive
   price discovery and convenience. Evidence from eBay fits the theory. We
   then show that the decline in auctions was not driven by compositional
   shifts in seller experience or items sold, but by changing seller
   incentives. We estimate the demand facing sellers and document falling
   sale probabilities and falling relative demand for auctions. Both favor
   posted prices; our estimates suggest the latter is more important for
   the auction decline. Survey evidence provides further support.

AB This paper quantitatively assesses time inconsistency, moral hazard, and
   political ideology in monopoly regulation of electricity distribution.
   We specify and estimate a dynamic model of utility regulation featuring
   investment and moral hazard. We find underinvestment in electricity
   distribution capital aiming to reduce power outages and use the
   estimated model to quantify the value of regulatory commitment in
   inducing greater investment. Furthermore, more conservative political
   environments grant higher regulated returns but have higher rates of
   electricity loss. Using the estimated model, we quantify how
   conservative regulators thus mitigate welfare losses due to time
   inconsistency but worsen losses from moral hazard.

AB Why do firms pay different wages? Empirical evidence suggests the
   presence of substantial differences in firm pay controlling for worker
   skill. Moreover, these differences are uncorrelated with skills,
   indicating the absence of sorting. I show that the face value
   interpretation is inconsistent with evidence on coworker segregation. I
   interpret the evidence by applying a sorting model and show that the
   correlation is biased. I identify nonmonotonicities in wages as the
   reason for this bias and show that a measure of worker-coworker sorting
   is more accurate. By calibrating the model to US data, I confirm that
   the model matches many job market characteristics.

   equilibrium and an opportunity to commit to a policy, can the agents
   reach an agreement on such a policy? We provide a consistency condition
   linking power structures in the dynamic setting and at the commitment
   stage. When the condition holds, commitment has no value: any agreement
   that may be reached at the outset coincides with the equilibrium without
   commitment. When the condition fails, as in the case of
   time-inconsistent preferences, commitment can improve outcomes. We
   discuss several applications.

   Individual International Philanthropy Database (IIPD, 2016; N-country =
   19; N-individual = 126,923). The results of the descriptive and
   multilevel analyses support the idea of crosswise crowding-in; in
   countries where government expenditures in health and social protection
   are higher, more donors give to support the environment, international
   aid, and the arts. The level of giving to different sectors, however, is
   not associated with government expenditures. The results reject the
   crowding-out hypothesis and provide a nuanced picture of the
   relationship between government funding and philanthropic giving across
   different fields of social welfare.

AB The economic crisis in Europe since 2008 has led to high unemployment
   levels in several countries. Previous research suggests that becoming
   unemployed is a health risk, but is job loss and unemployment easier to
   cope with when unemployment is widespread? Using EU-SILC panel data
   (2010-2013), this study examines short-term effects of unemployment on
   self-rated health (SRH) in 25 European countries with diverging
   macroeconomic conditions. Ordinary least squares regressions show that
   the unemployed are in worse health than the employed throughout Europe.
   The association is reduced considerably, but remains significant in
   several countries when time-invariant personal characteristics are
   accounted for using individual-level fixed-effects models. Propensity
   score kernel matching shows that both being and becoming unemployed are
   associated with slightly worse SRH. There is a weak tendency towards
   less health effects of unemployment in countries where the experience is
   widely shared. In particular, countries with a very low unemployment
   rate stand out with larger health effects. The results overall suggest
   that a changed composition of the unemployed population is an important
   explanation for the weaker unemployment-health association in
   high-unemployment countries.

AB A large body of literature has provided mixed results on the impact of
   welfare retrenchments on government support. This article examines
   whether the impact of welfare retrenchments can be explained by
   proximity, i.e. whether or not the retrenched policy is related to
   people's everyday lives. To overcome limitations in previous studies,
   the empirical approach utilizes a natural experiment with data from the
   European Social Survey collected concurrently with a salient
   retrenchment reform of the education grant system in Denmark. The
   results confirm that people proximate to a welfare policy react
   substantially stronger to retrenchment reforms than the general public.
   Robustness and placebo tests further show that the results are not
   caused by non-personal proximities or satisfaction levels not related to
   the reform and the government. In sum, the findings speak to a growing
   body of literature interested in the impact of government policies on

AB Socio-economically disadvantaged and ethnic minorities are affected by a

   unclear if selective migration causes this disproportionate exposure
   experienced by low-income and minority households. The study uses
   longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel to investigate
   the process of selective migration and its connection to the perceived
   exposure to air pollution in Germany. Consistent with the selective
   migration argument, movers experience a decrease in exposure according
   to their income, while stationary households do not experience a
   reductive effect due to income. Furthermore, the moving returns differ
   by minority status. While native German households experience less
   exposure to pollution when moving to a new place of residence, minority
   households do not. Additional analyses show that this minority effect
   cannot be explained by socio-economic differences, but completely
   vanishes in the second immigrant generation.

   on the family sphere, the article examines to what degree patterns of

   European countries. Using data from the Generations and Gender Survey
   (GGS) and the National Educational Panel Survey (NEPS) (n = 70,228
   respondents), the article adds to the methodological discussion of
   destandardization by implementing both abstract analyses of life course
   dissimilarity, which focus on the 'timing' of events; and specific
   analyses of common episode orders, which relate to the 'order' of
   events. While European countries differ considerably with respect to
   dominant life course patterns in early adulthood, a consistent finding
   is that destandardization is more pronounced among individuals with
   lower than with higher levels of education.

AB This study examines the importance of gifts and bequests ('wealth
   transfers') across the distribution of household wealth. Unconditional
   quantile regression applied to harmonized survey data obtained from 11
   European countries reveals that households that receive gifts and
   bequests own considerably more wealth than non-receiving households, all
   other things being equal. The wealth gap varies hugely along the
   distribution of net wealth. At the median, the wealth gap reaches about
   119,000 euros and increases to 630,000 euros at the 90th percentile.
   With regard to the 99th percentile, survey data even indicate
   differences in wealth levels greater than 2.3 million euros. Further
   analysis finds evidence that the impact of wealth transfers on household
   wealth follows an inverted U-shaped pattern: gifts and bequests
   contribute the most to the stock of private wealth in the broad
   mid-section and less so at the lower and upper ends of the distribution.
   Overall, the study provides evidence for a strong nexus between
   inheritance and household wealth that is not limited to the top.

AB This article sheds new light on the role played by perceived fairness in
   configuring the relationship between gendered housework division and
   women's family life satisfaction across 30 countries. This is achieved
   by distinguishing and comparing two major dimensions of women's fairness
   comparison-inter-gender relational comparison between partners and
   intra-gender referential comparison with other women from the same
   society. Analysing data from the 2012 International Social Survey
   Programme, we find that women's family life satisfaction is adversely
   affected by both a lack of relational fairness and unfavourable
   referential comparison, which operate independently of each other.
   Supporting the 'self-serving' theory, women are found to rely more on
   one dimension of fairness comparison to assess their family life
   satisfaction when they compare unfavourably rather than favourably in
   the other dimension. Country-level gender equality positively predicts
   the strength of the association between relational fairness and family
   life satisfaction. However, it does not seem to moderate the influence
   of referential comparison on family life satisfaction. In light of these
   results, scholars are urged to consider the perceived fairness of
   housework division as a plural construct, and to promulgate gender
   equality in multiple dimensions-addressing not just inter-gender (in)
   equity but also intra-gender (in) equality-to move the gender revolution
   forward.

AB Research has demonstrated that evictions primarily affect vulnerable
   populations. However, relatively little is known about the consequences
   eviction has, particularly regarding economic outcomes. Using
   comprehensive Swedish national register data on evictions in 2009, this
   study tests two competing hypotheses regarding to what extent an
   eviction affects subsequent economic hardship for an already
   disadvantaged group. The degree to which individuals rely on
   means-tested social assistance is used as an indicator of economic
   hardship. The cumulative disadvantage perspective predicts that
   additional strain will compound the economic hardship experienced by the
   group. In contrast, the disadvantage saturation perspective suggests
   that additional adversities may not add to economic hardship for
   disadvantaged individuals. Results from propensity score matching
   analyses show that, the year immediately after eviction, the degree of
   social assistance receipt was around 8 percentage points higher for the
   evicted group than for the matched comparison group. In the following 3
   years, the degree of social assistance receipt continued to be
   significantly higher for those evicted compared to peers. The results
   lend support to the cumulative disadvantage perspective and suggest
   that-in the context of preventing evictions-policy measures such as
   assistance to repay rent arrears would be adequate to prevent further
   economic hardship.

AB "Ban the Box" (BTB) policies restrict employers from asking about
   applicants' criminal histories on job applications and are often
   presented as a means of reducing unemployment among black men, who
   disproportionately have criminal records. However, withholding
   information about criminal records could risk encouraging racial
   discrimination: employers may make assumptions about criminality based
   on the applicant's race. To investigate BTB's effects, we sent
   approximately 15,000 online job applications on behalf of fictitious
   young, male applicants to employers in New Jersey and New York City
   before and after the adoption of BTB policies. These applications varied
   whether the applicant had a distinctly black or distinctly white name
   and the felony conviction status of the applicant. We confirm that
   criminal records are a major barrier to employment: employers that asked
   about criminal records were 63% more likely to call applicants with no
   record. However, our results support the concern that BTB policies
   encourage racial discrimination: the black-white gap in callbacks grew
   dramatically at companies that removed the box after the policy went
   into effect. Before BTB, white applicants to employers with the box
   received 7% more callbacks than similar black applicants, but BTB
   increased this gap to 43%. We believe that the best interpretation of
   these results is that employers are relying on exaggerated impressions
   of real-world racial differences in felony conviction rates.

AB We develop and test a theory to address a puzzling pattern that has been
   discussed widely since the 2016 U.S. presidential election and
   reproduced here in a post-election survey: how can a constituency of
   voters find a candidate authentically appealing (i.e., view him
   positively as authentic) even though he is a lying demagogue (someone
   who deliberately tells lies and appeals to non-normative private
   prejudices)? Key to the theory are two points: (1) common-knowledge lies
   may be understood as flagrant violations of the norm of truth-telling;
   and (2) when a political system is suffering from a crisis of legitimacy
   (Lipset 1959) with respect to at least one political constituency,
   members of that constituency will be motivated to see a flagrant
   violator of established norms as an authentic champion of its interests.
   Two online vignette experiments on a simulated college election support
   our theory. These results demonstrate that mere partisanship is
   insufficient to explain sharp differences in how lying demagoguery is
   perceived, and that several oft-discussed factorsinformation access,
   culture, language, and genderare not necessary for explaining such
   differences. Rather, for the lying demagogue to have authentic appeal,
   it is sufficient that one side of a social divide regards the political
   system as flawed or illegitimate.

AB In today's labor market, the majority of individuals experience a lapse
   in employment at some point in their careers, most commonly due to
   unemployment from job loss or leaving work to care for family or
   children. Existing scholarship has studied how unemployment affects
   subsequent career outcomes, but the consequences of temporarily opting
   out of work to care for family are relatively unknown. In this article,
   I ask: how do opt out parents fare when they re-enter the labor market?
   I argue that opting out signals a violation of ideal worker norms to
   employersnorms that expect employees to be highly dedicated to workand
   that this signal is distinct from two other types of resume signals:
   signals produced by unemployment due to job loss and the signal of
   motherhood or fatherhood. Using an original survey experiment and a
   large-scale audit study, I test the relative strength of these three
   resume signals. I find that mothers and fathers who temporarily opted
   out of work to care for family fared significantly worse in terms of
   hiring prospects, relative to applicants who experienced unemployment
   due to job loss and compared to continuously employed mothers and
   fathers. I examine variation in these signals' effects across local
   labor markets, and I find that within competitive markets, penalties
   emerged for continuously employed mothers and became even greater for
   opt out fathers. This research provides a causal test of the micro- and
   macro-level demand-side processes that disadvantage parents who leave
   work to care for family. This is important because when opt out
   applicants are prevented from re-entering the labor market, employers
   reinforce standards that exclude parents from full participation in
   work.

AB Social scientists often study the flow of material and social support as
   generalized exchange systems. These systems are associated with an array
   of benefits to groups and communities, but their existence is
   problematic, because individuals may be motivated to take from the
   system without giving back to it. Researchers have identified two broad
   processes governing prosociality in generalized exchange systems:
   generalized reciprocity (a person who receives help from someone pays it
   forward by helping a third person) and indirect reciprocity (a person
   who helps another establishes a prosocial reputation and, as a
   consequence, later receives help from a third person). Although
   generalized exchange systems can be based on either process, generalized
   and indirect reciprocity are based on different mechanisms and, with few
   exceptions, have been investigated independently. Here we present an
   integrated approach to generalized exchange that (1) specifies when each
   process is most likely to promote prosocial behavior, (2) details the
   implications for resource inequalities in generalized exchange systems,
   and (3) describes how generalized and indirect reciprocity jointly
   influence prosocial behavior. Results from four new experiments strongly
   support the theoretical arguments.

   challenges mean in the context of linked lives. Drawing on a life course
   framework, this study examines how young African Americans' experiences
   across a variety of salient domains during the transition to adulthood
   affect their mothers' health. Results suggest that stressors experienced
   by African Americans during the transition to adulthood (e.g.,
   unemployment, troubled romantic relationships, arrest) heighten their
   mothers' cumulative biological risk for chronic diseases, or allostatic
   load, and reduce subjective health. These results suggest that the toll
   of an increasingly tenuous and uncertain transition to adulthood extends
   beyond young people to their parents. Hence, increased public
   investments during this transition may not only reduce inequality and
   improve life chances for young people themselves, but may also enhance
   healthy aging by relieving the heavy burden on parents to help their
   children navigate this transition.

AB Industrial child labor laws were the earliest manifestation of the
   modern regulatory welfare state. Why, despite the absence of political
   pressure from below, did some states (but not others) succeed in
   legislating working hours, minimum ages, and schooling requirements for
   working children in the first half of the nineteenth century? I use case
   studies of the politics behind the first child labor laws in Germany and
   France, alongside a case study of a failed child labor reform effort in
   Belgium, to answer this question. I show that existing structural,
   class-based, and institutional theories of the welfare state are
   insufficient to explain why child labor laws came about. Highlighting
   instead the previously neglected role of elite policy entrepreneurs, I
   argue that the success or failure of early nineteenth-century child
   labor laws depended on these actors' social skill, pragmatic creativity,
   and goal-directedness. At the same time, their actions and influence
   were conditioned by their field position and the architecture of the
   policy field. By specifying the qualities and conditions that enable
   policy entrepreneurs to build the alliances needed to effect policy
   change, this analysis lends precision to the general claim that their
   agency matters.

   countries. We document that average hours worked per adult are
   substantially higher in low-income countries than in high-income
   countries. The pattern of decreasing hours with aggregate income holds
   for both men and women, for adults of all ages and education levels, and
   along both the extensive and intensive margin. Within countries, hours
   worked per worker are also decreasing in the individual wage for most
   countries, though in the richest countries, hours worked are flat or
   increasing in the wage. One implication of our findings is that
   aggregate productivity and welfare differences across countries are
   larger than currently thought. (JEL E23, E24, J22, J31, O11, O15)

AB With growing affective polarization in the United States, partisanship
   is increasingly an impediment to cooperation in political settings. But
   does partisanship also affect behavior in nonpolitical settings? We show
   evidence that it does, demonstrating its effect on economic outcomes
   across a range of experiments in real-world environments. A field
   experiment in an online labor market indicates that workers request
   systematically lower reservation wages when the employer shares their
   political stance, reflecting a preference to work for co-partisans. We
   conduct two field experiments with consumers and find a preference for
   dealing with co-partisans, especially among those with strong partisan
   attachments. Finally, via a population-based, incentivized survey
   experiment, we find that the influence of political considerations on
   economic choices extends also to weaker partisans. Whereas earlier
   studies show the political consequences of polarization in American
   politics, our findings suggest that partisanship spills over beyond the
   political, shaping cooperation in everyday economic behavior.

   constituencies' religious composition is a key empirical predictor of
   Nazi vote shares-dwarfing the explanatory power of any other demographic
   or socioeconomic variable. Even after carefully accounting for
   observational differences, Catholics were far less likely to vote for
   the NSDAP than their Protestant counterparts. The evidence suggests that
   this disparity was, in large part, due to the sway of the Catholic
   Church and its dignitaries. At the same time, we show that attempts to
   immunize Catholics against the radical left failed to achieve the
   desired result. To explain the puzzling asymmetry in the Church's
   influence at the ballot box, we develop a simple theoretical framework
   of elite influence in electoral politics.

AB An important empirical literature evaluates whether voters are rational
   by examining how electoral outcomes respond to events outside the
   control of politicians, such as natural disasters or economic shocks.
   The argument is that rational voters should not base electoral decisions
   on such events, so evidence that these events affect electoral outcomes
   is evidence of voter irrationality. We show that such events can affect
   electoral outcomes, even if voters are rational and have instrumental
   preferences. The reason is that these events change voters'
   opportunities to learn new information about incumbents. Thus,
   identifying voter (ir)rationality requires more than just identifying
   the impact of exogenous shocks on electoral fortunes. Our analysis
   highlights systematic ways in which electoral fortunes are expected to
   change in response to events outside incumbents' control. Such results
   can inform empirical work attempting to identify voter (ir)rationality.

AB Concerns that interest groups use their financial resources to distort
   the democratic process are long-standing. Surprisingly, though, firms
   spend little money on political campaigns, and roughly 95% of publicly
   traded firms in the United States have never contributed to a political
   campaign. Do interest groups seek political access through their modest
   contributions, or are these contributions only a minor and forgettable
   part of the political process? In this article, we present comprehensive
   evidence that interest groups are extremely sophisticated in the way
   they make campaign contributions. We collect a new data set on U.S.
   state legislative committee assignments and legislator procedural powers
   from 1988 to 2014, merged with campaign finance data, in order to
   analyze over 440,000 candidate-committee observations across 99
   legislatures. Using a series of difference-in-differences designs based
   on changes in individual legislators' positions in the legislature, we
   not only show that interest groups seek out committee members, but we
   also show that they value what we call indirect access. When a
   legislator gains procedural powers, interest groups reallocate
   considerable amounts of money to her. The results reveal how interest
   groups in a wide range of democratic settings seek to influence the
   policy process not only by seeking direct access to policy makers but by
   seeking indirect access to legislative procedure as well.

AB Studies of residential segregation typically focus on its degree without

   Distance-based and sequence indices can reflect spatial patterns but
   with some limitations, while geocoded 100% population data make possible
   more informative measures. One improvement is flexibility in spatial
   scale, ranging from adjacent buildings to whole districts of the city.
   Another is the ability to map patterns in fine detail. In southern
   cities the authors find qualitatively distinct configurations that
   include not only black "neighborhoods" as usually imagined but also
   backyard housing, alley housing, and side streets that were
   predominantly black. These configurations represent the sort of symbolic
   boundaries recognized by urban ethnographers. By mapping residential
   configurations and interpreting them in light of historical accounts,
   the authors intend to capture meanings that are too often missed by

AB Malapportionment doubly penalizes people from relatively large electoral
   districts or constituencies by under-representing them in the
   legislature and in the political executive or cabinet. The latter effect
   has not been studied. This article develops theoretical reasons for
   large constituency disadvantage in the cabinet formation process, and
   tests them using a new repeated cross-sectional dataset on elections and
   cabinet formation in India's states, from 1977-2007. A
   one-standard-deviation increase in relative constituency size is
   associated with a 22 per cent fall in the probability of a
   constituency's representative being in the cabinet. Malapportionment
   affects cabinet inclusion by causing large parties to focus on winning
   relatively small constituencies. These effects are likely to hold in
   parliamentary systems, and in other contexts where the legislature
   influences cabinet inclusion.

AB Causes and consequences of the so-called NEET status (Not in Employment,
   Education or Training) are one of the popular foreign areas of youth
   labour markets research. NEET youth are one of the most vulnerable
   categories of the non-employed. Representatives of this group are common
   recipients of social benefits from the state and depend on the money
   transfers from relatives. The probability of finding a permanent job for
   young people who previously were in the NEET status is reduced. They
   have higher risks of informal employment, problems with physical and
   mental health, propensity to criminal activities and substance abuse,
   low level of trust in social institutions. Despite the relevance of the
   study, youth transitions between school, employment and different types
   of NEET status (so-called NEET-unemployment and NEET-inactivity) are
   relatively rare analyzed on panel data. Present study introduces the
   flows of young people entering and leaving the NEET group in the Russian
   labour market as the focus of the research for the first time. This
   topic is particu-larly relevant for Russia since, according to Rosstat,
   the share of Russian NEET youth in 2010-2015 was 12-15% of all young
   people aged 15-24 years. The source of the data for the study is the
   Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey - Higher School of Economics
   (RLMS-HSE) for 2000-2016. The main findings of the study are based on
   the analysis of the transition matrices and the results of the
   estimations of dynamic multinomial logit regression models on the
   sub-samples of men and women aged 15-24 years. According to the results
   received the share of NEET youth in Russia by 2016 was about 15% of all
   young people aged 15-24 years. At the same time, during the economic
   crisis, the growth in the share of NEET youth was mainly due to the
   increase of NEET-unemployment. The share of the latter in 2015-2016
   reached the max-imum values for the entire period analyzed (9-10% of all
   young people aged 15-24 years). De-spite the heterogeneous nature of the
   Russian NEET, the risks of falling into this state are main-ly
   associated with education - either with its insufficient level (in the
   case of inactive NEETs) or with its low quality (in the case of
   unemployed NEETs). Thus, higher education in Russia is associated with
   the greatest risks of NEET unemployment, while the risks of transition
   to the state of NEET-inactivity are concentrated among those who
   received vocational education after incomplete secondary school or after
   graduating from high school. Changes in the marital status are also
   among important factors of NEET state. However the probability of
   finding a job next year reaches 50% for unemployed NEETs, and about
   30-40% for inactive NEETs. Thus, NEET status at the moment does not seem
   to be unequivocal hopeless «trap» for Russian youth.
Z4 Понимание причин и последствий попадания молодежи в специфическую
   группу, которая не учится и не работает - так называемую группу NEET
   (Not in Employment, Education or Training), - является актуальной
   областью исследований зарубежных рынков труда. Молодежь NEET, как
   правило, составляет одну из наиболее уязвимых категорий незанятого
   населения. Представители данной группы часто являются получателями
   социальных пособий от государства, зависят от денежных трансфертов
   родственников, вероятность нахождения постоянной работы для молодых
   людей, побывавших в статусе NEET, снижается. Среди других негативных
   последствий отмечаются риски неформальной занятости, проблемы с
   физическим и психическим здоровьем, склонность к правонарушениям и
   потреблению алкоголя и наркотиков, низкий уровень доверия к социальным
   институтам. Несмотря на актуальность изучения особенностей переходов
   молодежи между различными типами статуса NEET (NEET-безработицы и
   NEET-неактивности) и состояниями обучения и занятости, подобные
   исследования пока проводятся на панельных данных относительно редко.
   Настоящее исследование впервые помещает в фокус анализа потоки молодежи,
   входящие и исходящие из состояния NEET на российском рынке труда. Данная
   тема представляет актуальность для России, так как, согласно данным
   Росстата, доля российской NEET-молодежи в период 2010-2015 гг.
   составляла 12-15% всей молодежи в возрасте 15-24 лет. Эмпирическую базу
   исследования представляют данные Российского мониторинга экономического
   положения и здоровья населения НИУ ВШЭ (РМЭЗ НИУ ВШЭ) за 2000-2016 гг.
   Основные выводы исследования базируются на анализе матриц перехода и
   результатах оценивания динамической мультиномиальной логит-регрессии на
   подвыборках мужчин и женщин в возрасте 15-24 лет. Согласно полученным
   результатам, доля NEET-молодежи в России к 2016 г. составляла около 15%
   всей молодежи в возрасте 15-24 лет. При этом в периоды экономического
   кризиса рост доли NEET-молодежи происходил преимущественно за счет
   увеличения NEET-безработных молодых людей. Доля последних в 2015-2016
   гг. достигла максимальных значений за весь анализируемый период (9-10%
   всей молодежи в возрасте 15-24 лет). Несмотря на неоднородный характер
   российской NEET-молодежи, риски попадания в состояние NEET связаны,
   преимущественно, с образованием - либо с его недостаточным уровнем (в
   случае неактивных NEET), либо с его невысоким качеством (в случае
   безработных NEET). Так, высшее профессиональное образование в России
   оказывается сопряжено с наибольшими рисками NEET-безработицы, в то время
   как риски перехода в NEET-неактивность сосредоточены среди тех, кто
   закончил ПТУ после неполного среднего образования или после выпуска из
   старшей школы. Важным фактором попадания молодежи в статус NEET является
   и изменение семейного статуса. При этом вероятность найти работу в
   следующем году составляет около 50% для безработных NEET, и около 30-40%
   - для неактивных NEET. Таким образом, статус NEET в настоящий момент не
   представляется однозначной безвыходной «ловушкой» для российской
   молодежи.

AB Two cornerstones of empirical and policy analysis of firms, in macro,
   labor and industrial organization, are the determinants of the firm size
   distribution and the determinants of sorting between workers and firms.
   We propose a unifying theory of production where management resolves a
   tradeoff between hiring more versus better workers. The span of control
   or size is therefore intimately intertwined with the sorting pattern. We
   provide a condition for sorting that captures this tradeoff between the
   quantity and quality of workers and that generalizes Becker's sorting
   condition. A system of differential equations determines the equilibrium
   allocation, the firm size, and wages, and allows us to characterize the
   allocation of the quality and quantity of labor to firms of different
   productivity. We show that our model nests a large number of widely used
   existing models. We also augment the model to incorporate labor market
   frictions in the presence of sorting with large firms.

AB We develop a recursive dual method for solving dynamic economic
   problems. The method uses a Lagrangian to pair a dynamic recursive
   economic problem with a dual problem. We show that such dual problems
   can be recursively decomposed with costates (i.e., Lagrange multipliers
   on laws of motion) functioning as state variables. In dynamic
   contracting and policy settings, the method often replaces an endogenous
   state space of forward-looking utilities with an exogenously given state
   space of costates. We provide a principle of optimality for dual
   problems and give conditions under which the dual Bellman operator is a
   contraction with the optimal dual value function its unique fixed point.
   We relate economic problems to their duals, address computational
   issues, and give examples.

   arbitrarily history-dependent strategies. I derive a simple sufficient
   structure for optimal punishments and thereby fully characterize (i) the
   set of equilibrium outcomes for any given preference profile, and (ii)
   the set of preference profiles for which equilibrium is unique. Based on
   this characterization, I establish that a weak notion of present
   biasimplied, for example, by any hyperbolic or quasi-hyperbolic
   discountingis sufficient for equilibrium to be unique, stationary, and
   efficient. Conversely, I demonstrate how certain violations of present
   bias give rise to multiple (non-stationary) equilibria that feature
   delayed agreement under gradually increasing offers.

AB This paper provides a framework for identifying preferences in a large
   network where links are pairwise stable. Network formation models
   present difficulties for identification, especially when links can be
   interdependent, for example, when indirect connections matter. We show
   how one can use the observed proportions of various local network
   structures to learn about the underlying preference parameters. The key
   assumption for our approach restricts individuals to have bounded degree
   in equilibrium, implying a finite number of payoff-relevant local
   structures. Our main result provides necessary conditions for parameters
   to belong to the identified set. We then develop a quadratic programming
   algorithm that can be used to construct this set. With further
   restrictions on preferences, we show that our conditions are also
   sufficient for pairwise stability and therefore characterize the
   identified set precisely. Overall, the use of both the economic model
   along with pairwise stability allows us to obtain effective dimension
   reduction.

   (2008). These models combine traditional exclusion restrictions with a
   requirement that each structural error enter through a residual index.
   Our identification results are constructive and encompass a range of
   special cases with varying demands on the exogenous variation provided
   by instruments and the shape of the joint density of the structural
   errors. The most important results demonstrate identification when
   instruments have only limited variation. Even when instruments vary only
   over a small open ball, relatively mild conditions on the joint density
   suffice. We also show that the primary sufficient conditions for
   identification are verifiable and that the maintained hypotheses of the
   model are falsifiable.

AB In the study of social processes, the presence of unobserved
   heterogeneity is a regular concern. It should be particularly worrisome
   for the statistical analysis of networks, given the complex dependencies
   that shape network formation combined with the restrictive assumptions
   of related models. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of
   explicitly accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in exponential random
   graph models (ERGM) with a Monte Carlo analysis and two applications
   that have played an important role in the networks literature. Overall,
   these analyses show that failing to account for unobserved heterogeneity
   can have a significant impact on inferences about network formation. The
   proposed frailty extension to the ERGM (FERGM) generally outperforms the
   ERGM in these cases, and does so by relatively large margins. Moreover,
   our novel multilevel estimation strategy has the advantage of avoiding
   the problem of degeneration that plagues the standard MCMC-MLE approach.

AB Does treatment mode matter in studies of the effects of candidate race

   work is that such treatment mode differences are either small and/or
   theoretically well understood, so that the choice of how to signal the
   race of a candidate is largely one of convenience. But this assumption
   remains untested. Using a nationally representative sample of white
   voting-age citizens and a modified conjoint design, we evaluate whether
   signaling candidate ethnicity with ethnic labels and names results in
   different effects than signaling candidate ethnicity with ethnically
   identifiable photos and names. Our results provide strong evidence that
   treatment-mode effects are substantively large and statistically
   significant. Further, these treatment-mode effects are not consistent
   with extant theoretical accounts. These results highlight the need for
   additional theoretical and empirical work on race/ethnicity

AB The item count technique (ICT-MLE) regression model for survey list
   experiments depends on assumptions about responses at the extremes
   (choosing no or all items on the list). Existing list experiment best
   practices aim to minimize strategic misrepresentation in ways that
   virtually guarantee that a tiny number of respondents appear in the
   extrema. Under such conditions both the "no liars" identification
   assumption and the computational strategy used to estimate the ICT-MLE
   become difficult to sustain. I report the results of Monte Carlo
   experiments examining the sensitivity of the ICT-MLE and simple
   difference-in-means estimators to survey design choices and small
   amounts of non-strategic respondent error. I show that, compared to the
   difference in means, the performance of the ICT-MLE depends on list
   design. Both estimators are sensitive to measurement error, but the
   problems are more severe for the ICT-MLE as a direct consequence of the
   no liars assumption. These problems become extreme as the number of
   treatment-group respondents choosing all the items on the list
   decreases. I document that such problems can arise in real-world
   applications, provide guidance for applied work, and suggest directions
   for further research.

AB Measuring the causal impact of state behavior on outcomes is one of the
   biggest methodological challenges in the field of political science, for
   two reasons: behavior is generally endogenous, and the threat of
   unobserved variables that confound the relationship between behavior and
   outcomes is pervasive. Matching methods, widely considered to be the
   state of the art in causal inference in political science, are generally
   ill-suited to inference in the presence of unobserved confounders.
   Heckman-style multiple-equation models offer a solution to this problem;
   however, they rely on functional-form assumptions that can produce
   substantial bias in estimates of average treatment effects. We describe
   a category of models, flexible joint likelihood models, that account for
   both features of the data while avoiding reliance on rigid
   functional-form assumptions. We then assess these models' performance in
   a series of neutral simulations, in which they produce substantial (55%
   to >90%) reduction in bias relative to competing models. Finally, we
   demonstrate their utility in a reanalysis of Simmons' (2000) classic
   study of the impact of Article VIII commitment on compliance with the
   IMF's currency-restriction regime.

AB In Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), empirical researchers use the
   consistency value as one, if not sole, criterion to decide whether an
   association between a term and an outcome is consistent with a
   set-relational claim. Braumoeller (2015) points out that the consistency
   value is unsuitable for this purpose. We need to know the probability of
   obtaining it under the null hypothesis of no systematic relation. He
   introduces permutation testing for estimating the p value of a
   consistency score as a safeguard against false positives. In this paper,
   I introduce permutation-based power estimation as a safeguard against
   false-negative conclusions. Low power might lead to the false exclusion
   of truth table rows from the minimization procedure and the generation
   and interpretation of invalid solutions. For a variety of constellations
   between an alternative and null hypothesis and numbers of cases,
   simulations demonstrate that power estimates can range from 1 to 0. Ex
   post power analysis for 6 3 truth table analyses shows that even under
   the most favorable constellation of parameters, about half of them can
   be considered low-powered. This points to the value of estimating power
   and calculating the required number of cases before the truth table
   analysis.

AB Duration analyses in political science often model nonproportional
   hazards through interactions with analysis time. To facilitate their
   interpretation, methodologists have proposed methods to visualize
   time-varying coefficients or hazard ratios. While these techniques are a
   useful, initial postestimation step, I argue that they are insufficient
   to identify the overall impact of a time-varying effect and may lead to
   faulty inference when a coefficient changes its sign. I show how even
   significant changes of a coefficient's sign do not imply that the
   overall effect is reversed over time. In order to enable a correct
   interpretation of time-varying effects in this context, researchers
   should visualize their results with survivor functions. I outline how
   survivor functions are calculated for models with time-varying effects
   and demonstrate the need for such a nuanced interpretation using the
   prominent finding of a time-varying effect of mediation on interstate
   conflict. The reanalysis of the data using the proposed visualization
   methods indicates that the conclusions of earlier mediation research are
   misleading. The example highlights how survivor functions are an
   essential tool to clarify the ambiguity inherent in time-varying
   coefficients in event history models.

AB Measuring the polarization of legislators and parties is a key step in
   understanding how politics develops over time. But in parliamentary
   systems-where ideological positions estimated from roll calls may not be
   informative-producing valid estimates is extremely challenging. We
   suggest a new measurement strategy that makes innovative use of the
   "accuracy" of machine classifiers, i.e., the number of correct
   predictions made as a proportion of all predictions. In our case, the
   "labels" are the party identifications of the members of parliament,
   predicted from their speeches along with some information on debate
   subjects. Intuitively, when the learner is able to discriminate members
   in the two main Westminster parties well, we claim we are in a period of
   "high" polarization. By contrast, when the classifier has low
   accuracy-and makes a relatively large number of mistakes in terms of
   allocating members to parties based on the data-we argue parliament is
   in an era of "low" polarization. This approach is fast and substantively
   valid, and we demonstrate its merits with simulations, and by comparing
   the estimates from 7 8 years of House of Commons speeches with
   qualitativeand quantitative historical accounts of the same. As a
   headline finding, wenote that contemporary British politics is
   approximately as polarized as itwas in the mid-1960s-that is, in the
   middle of the "postwar consensus". More broadly, we show that the
   technical performance of supervised learning algorithms can be directly
   informative about substantive matters in social science.

   Political scientists have offered a variety of conceptual frameworks,

   terrorism, despite the central role the public plays in our
   understanding of the relationship between terrorism and government
   action in the wake of violence. We synthesize components of both
   scholarly definitions and public debates to formulate predictions for
   how various attributes of incidents affect the likelihood they are
   perceived as terrorism. Combining a conjoint experiment with machine
   learning techniques and automated content analysis of media coverage, we
   show the importance not only of the type and severity of violence, but
   also the attributed motivation for the incident and social
   categorization of the actor. The findings demonstrate how the language
   used to describe violent incidents, for which the media has considerable
   latitude, affects the likelihood the public classifies incidents as

AB This article shows that the disloyalty of political brokers causes party
   fragility. Lacking distinctive brands, organization, and activists to
   mobilize individuals, parties hire local notables to broker votes among
   a local, nonpartisan constituency. However, brokers may be unreliable
   agents, regularly changing political allegiances in search of better
   returns for their brokerage among the module of voters they control.
   This free agency from brokers hinders durable party-voter linkages and
   results in electorally vulnerable parties. Measuring how brokers
   influence parties is empirically complex, but taking advantage of the
   fact that in Brazil these agents are also local candidates, this article
   demonstrates the negative electoral consequences of brokers' free agency

AB To what extent do partisan media sources shape public opinion? On its
   face, it would appear that the impact of partisan media is limited,
   given that it attracts a relatively small audience. We argue, however,
   that its influence may extend beyond its direct audience via a two-step
   communication flow. Specifically, those who watch and are impacted by
   partisan media outlets talk to and persuade others who did not watch. We
   present experimental results that demonstrate this process. We therefore
   show that previous studies may have significantly underestimated the
   effect of these outlets. We also illustrate that how the two-step
   communication flow works is contingent upon the precise composition of
   the discussion group (e.g., is it consistent of all fellow partisans or
   a mix of partisans?). We conclude by highlighting what our results imply
   about the study of media, preference formation, and partisan
   polarization.

AB Studies of bill sponsorship in the modern Congress highlight the effects
   of constituency characteristics, seniority, and committee membership.
   These studies, however, are limited in their ability to assess the
   effects of institutions. We provide the first systematic study of bill
   sponsorship in the premodern House of Representatives. In doing so, we
   take advantage of this period's expansive legislative agenda and
   variation in electoral system rules. Using matching and event count
   models, we estimate the effects of institutions, electoral competition,
   and members' institutional positions and political experiences on their
   sponsorship of different types of bills. We find that two reforms-the
   Australian ballot and nominating primary-increased sponsorship of bills
   designed to cultivate personal votes, thereby contributing to the growth
   in private legislation and bills aimed at local constituencies. Our
   results establish these reforms as a major event shaping lawmaking
   activity and, with it, the character of contemporary representation.

AB Election monitoring has become a key instrument of democracy promotion.
   Election monitors routinely expect to deter fraud and prevent
   post-election violence, but in reality, post-election violence often
   increases when monitors do expose fraud. We argue that monitors can make
   all elections less fraudulent and more peaceful on average, but only by
   causing more violence in fraudulent elections. Due to this curse,
   strategic election monitors can make a positive impact on elections only
   if their objectives are aligned in a very specific fashion. Monitors who
   do not aim to prevent violence can be effective only if they are
   unbiased, whereas monitors who do aim to prevent violence can be
   effective only if they are moderately biased against the government.
   Consequently, election monitors with misaligned objectives will fail to
   prevent violence, whereas monitors with well-aligned objectives will be
   blamed for causing violence.

AB Studies have pointed to politics as an important force driving people
   away from religionthe argument is that the dogmatic politics of the
   Christian Right have alienated liberals and moderates, effectively
   threatening organized religion in America. We argue that existing
   explanations are incomplete; a proper reconsideration necessitates
   distinguishing processes of affiliation (with specific congregations)
   from identification (with religious traditions). Using three data sets,
   we find evidence that qualifies and complements existing narratives of
   religious exit. Evaluations of congregational political fit drive
   retention decisions. At the same time, opposition to the Christian Right
   only bears on retention decisions when it is salient in a congregational
   context, affecting primarily evangelicals and Republicans. These results
   help us understand the dynamics of the oft-observed relationship between
   the Christian Right and deidentification and urge us to adopt a broader,
   more pluralistic view of the politicization of American religion.

AB Why do industries donate money to legislative campaigns when roll-call
   votes suggest that donors gain nothing in return? I argue that corporate
   donors may shape policy outcomes by influencing powerful agenda setters
   in the early stages of lawmaking. On the basis of a new data set of more
   than 45,000 individual state legislator sessions (1988-2012), I document
   how agenda control is deemed valuable to legislators and groups seeking
   influence on policy. Employing a difference-in-differences design, I
   assess the revealed price, as measured by campaign contributions, that
   firms are willing to pay for access to committee and party leaders and
   document how this price varies across industries and institutions. The
   results indicate that industries systematically funnel money to the
   legislative agenda setters by whom they are regulated, and to those
   endowed with important procedural powers. I document that the value of
   agenda-setter positions has increased dramatically in recent years.
   Finally, exploiting changes in state laws, I show that relaxing
   contribution limits significantly benefits committee chairs and party
   leaders more so than it does other legislators, suggesting that agenda
   setters have strong incentives to obstruct restrictive campaign finance
   reforms.

AB Petition canvassers are political recruiters. Building upon the rational
   prospector model, we theorize that rational recruiting strategies are
   dynamic (Bayesian and time-conscious), spatial (constrained by
   geography), and social (conditioned on relations between canvasser and
   prospect). Our theory predicts that canvassers will exhibit homophily in
   their canvassing preferences and will alternate between "door-to-door"
   and "attractor" (working in a central location) strategies based upon
   systematic geographical variation. They will adjust their strategies
   midstream (mid-petition) based upon experience. Introducing methods to
   analyze canvassing data, we test these hypotheses on geocoded signatory
   lists from two petition drivesa 2005-6 anti-Iraq War initiative in
   Wisconsin and an 1839 antislavery campaign in New York City. Canvassers
   in these campaigns exhibited homophily to the point of following
   geographically and politically "inefficient" paths. In the aggregate,
   these patterns may exacerbate political inequality, limiting political
   involvement of the poorer and less educated.

AB In many countries, important features of municipal government (such as

   depend on whether the municipality is above or below arbitrary
   population thresholds. Several papers have used a regression
   discontinuity design (RDD) to measure the effects of these
   threshold-based policies on political and economic outcomes. Using
   evidence from France, Germany, and Italy, we highlight two common
   pitfalls that arise in exploiting population-based policies (compound
   treatment and sorting), and we provide guidance for detecting and
   addressing these pitfalls. Even when these problems are present,
   population-threshold RDD may be the best available research design for
   studying the effects of certain policies and political institutions.

PD JAN 2018
PY 2018
AB Knowledge practices, expert and nonexpert alike, have received increased
   scholarly attention, but their affective underpinnings remain little
   understood. This article builds on the extant literature and on original
   ethnographic and interview data to elaborate a model of affective
   relational knowledge that distinguishes between emotions' supportive,
   didactic, and inductive roles in expert work. The author compares
   psychoanalytic and cognitive behavioral psychotherapeutic practices and
   shows that all therapists rely on emotions' supportive role. However,
   while psychoanalytic therapists depend on their emotions' inductive
   function to understand patients' internal states, their cognitive
   behavioral colleagues only rely on this strategy when their own tools
   fail to show results, emphasizing instead the didactic uses of their
   affective dispositions. Additionally, clinicians in these orientations
   adopt different strategies to legitimize their affective-relational
   work. Although psychotherapists are especially likely to rely on their
   emotions as epistemic tools, existing studies hint at this model's
   applicability in other expert domains.

AB Scholars across the social sciences have long hypothesized that
   individual contributors often make political contributions on the basis
   of partisanship or ideology and that the most active donors may be the
   most ideologically motivated. But drawing from a newly constructed "big"
   data set called the Longitudinal Elite Contributor Database (LECD), the
   author shows that past studies have failed to detect several striking
   patterns in the strategies of individual contributors: (1) a persistent
   positive association between frequency of giving and bipartisan or
   "split contributing" and (2) significant declines in the likelihood of
   bipartisan contributing since the late 1980s. The author shows that
   donors who give to both parties also target more moderate incumbents of
   each political party, relative to partisan donors. Taken together, the
   findings suggest that repeat individual donors are less partisan in
   their strategies, and vis-a-vis the incumbents to whom they send
   donations, these repeat contributors are also less ideologically
   extreme.

AB This study assesses the causes of within-group inequality, or the
   inequality occurring among workers and households otherwise similar on
   observed characteristics. The author situates his research in a
   longitudinal analysis of local labor markets to determine the
   heterogeneous set of causes of within-group inequality. A data set is
   constructed locating within-and between-group portions of male wage,
   female wage, and household income inequality from nine waves of the
   integrated public use microdata series from the U.S. census in 722
   temporally stable geographical units that cover the entire contiguous
   United States. Results from heteroscedastic and multilevel
   repeated-measures regression models reveal that within-group inequality
   follows economic development along a U-shaped pattern and that the
   well-established curvilinear relationship between development and
   inequality occurs specifically through the within-group portion of wages
   and incomes. Other factors-including sector change, occupational task
   concentration, educational expansion, urbanization, and
   deinstitutionalization-contribute to explain the association between
   within-group inequality and economic development.

AB Foreign aid donors make themselves visible as the funders of development
   projects to improve citizen attitudes abroad. Do target populations
   receive these political communications in the intended fashion, and does
   the information succeed in changing attitudes? Despite the widespread
   use of various mechanisms to communicate information about foreign
   funding, little evidence exists about their effectiveness. We embed an
   informational experiment about a US-funded health project in a
   nationwide survey in Bangladesh. Although we find only limited
   recognition of the USAID brand, explicit information about US funding
   slightly improves general perceptions of the United States; it does not,
   however, change respondent's opinions on substantive foreign policy
   issues. We also find that information increases confidence in local
   authorities. While our results suggest that information about foreign
   donors can effect attitudinal change, they also suggest that current
   mechanisms for information transmission might not be sufficient to do
   so.

AB While there is broad consensus that non-governmental organizations
   (NGOs) sometimes succeed in influencing policy making within
   international organizations (IOs), there is much less agreement on the
   factors that make NGO lobbying effective. This article makes two
   contributions to this debate. First, the determinants of influence among
   NGOs active in different IOs, issue areas and policy phases are
   examined. The analysis builds on original survey data of more than 400
   NGOs involved in five different IOs, complemented by elite interviews
   with IO and state officials. Secondly, the article advances a specific
   argument about how the strategic exchange of information and access
   between NGOs and IOs increases NGO influence in IOs. This argument,
   derived from theories of lobbying in American and European politics, is
   contrasted with three alternative explanations of NGO influence,
   privileging material resources, transnational networks and public
   opinion mobilization, and the broader implications of these results for
   research on NGOs in global governance are explored.

AB In 1950, members of the American Political Science Association's
   Committee on Political Parties argued that voters could exercise greater
   control over government if the two major political parties adopted clear
   and ideologically distinct policy platforms. In 2015, partisan
   polarization is a defining feature of American politics and extreme
   parties have maintained support elsewhere. This article investigates
   voter decision-making with ideologically divergent electoral choices and
   argues that ideological conflict reduces citizens' responsiveness to
   candidates' ideological locations by increasing the role of motivated
   reasoning in political decision-making. Results from two observational
   studies and a survey experiment support this account, and the findings
   are robust across a range of models. These results have important
   implications for accountability and democratic decision-making in an age
   of partisan polarization.

AB Though there is widespread scholarly consensus that American political
   elites have become increasingly ideologically polarized, there remains
   debate about how the mass electorate has responded to the increase in
   polarization at the elite level. This article shows that as party elites
   have become more polarized, individuals have become better able to
   identify the party that best matches their own ideological positions,
   thereby contributing to polarization at the mass level. Using forty
   years of ANES and DW-NOMINATE data to test this argument, it was found
   that the relationship between a voter's position in policy space and
   their political behavior is indeed conditional upon polarization at the
   elite level. This finding demonstrates how changes in elite polarization
   translate to behavioral changes on the mass level.

   policymaking. Yet, quotas, reserved seats, communal rolls, and
   race-conscious districting make it difficult to distinguish whether it
   is group membership, electoral incentives, or a combination of the two
   that matters. It is argued here that lawmakers who are members of
   underrepresented groups will stand out as defenders of their group's
   interests only when electoral rules incentivize them to do so. This is
   demonstrated empirically using data from New Zealand, showing that Mori
   Members of Parliament systematically vary in the extent to which they
   represent their ethnic group as a function of the three different sets
   of rules under which they were elected.

AB Why are voters in some electoral constituencies able to successfully
   co-ordinate their balloting decisions on viable party offerings, while
   those in other constituencies are not? Prior work on voter co-ordination
   failures has focused on institutional and elite-level explanations. This
   article demonstrates that characteristics of the voting constituencies
   themselves - specifically their socio-demographic diversity - can play
   an important role in shaping voters' collective ability to co-ordinate
   around viable party offerings. It synthesizes theories of collective
   decision making from the field of organizational psychology with
   theories of institutions as incentive structures to argue that diversity
   inhibits collective co-ordination in some contexts, but not others. In
   so doing, the article offers a new causal mechanism that links diversity
   and district magnitude to party system size. The argument is tested
   using a cross-national analysis of tens of thousands of voters across
   lower house elections in twelve countries.

AB How does democratic politics inform the interdisciplinary debate on the
   evolution of human co-operation and the social preferences (for example,
   trust, altruism and reciprocity) that support it? This article advances
   a theory of partisan trust discrimination in electoral democracies based
   on social identity, cognitive heuristics and interparty competition.
   Evidence from behavioral experiments in eight democracies show trust
   gaps' between co- and rival partisans are ubiquitous, and larger than
   trust gaps based on the social identities that undergird the party
   system. A natural experiment found that partisan trust gaps in the
   United States disappeared immediately following the killing of Osama bin
   Laden. But observational data indicate that partisan trust gaps track
   with perceptions of party polarization in all eight cases. Finally, the
   effects of partisanship on trust outstrip minimal group treatments, yet
   minimal-group effects are on par with the effects of most treatments for
   ascriptive characteristics in the literature. In sum, these findings
   suggest political competition dramatically shapes the salience of
   partisanship in interpersonal trust, the foundation of co-operation.

   cultural trait of which the attitude towards a specific group is just
   one expression. It finds evidence for the latter, identifying
   geographical variation in anti-immigrant sentiment in the twenty-first

   propose that increasing voter turnout would reduce the quality of

   outcomes. However, the proposed tradeoff between increased participation
   and informed participation is a false dichotomy. This article
   demonstrates that political information is endogenous to participation.
   A field experiment integrates an intensive mobilization treatment into a
   panel survey conducted before and after a city-wide election. Subjects
   who were mobilized to vote also became more informed about the content

AB Researchers have puzzled over the finding that countries that ratify UN

   likely to abuse human rights than non-ratifiers over time. This article
   presents evidence that the changing standard of accountability - the set
   of expectations that monitoring agencies use to hold states responsible
   for repressive actions - conceals real improvements to the level of
   respect for human rights in data derived from monitoring reports. Using
   a novel dataset that accounts for systematic changes to human rights
   reports, it is demonstrated that the ratification of human rights
   treaties is associated with higher levels of respect for human rights.
   This positive relationship is robust to a variety of measurement
   strategies and model specifications.

AB Although the labor market consequences of incarceration in prison have
   been central to the literature on mass incarceration, punishment, and
   inequality, other components of the growing criminal justice system have
   received less attention from sociologists. In particular, the rise of
   mass incarceration was accompanied by an even larger increase in
   community supervision. In this paper, we examine the labor market
   effects of one frequently experienced aspect of post-prison parole,
   short-term custody for parole violations. Although such sanctions are
   viewed as an alternative to returning parole violators to prison, they
   have the potential to affect labor market outcomes in ways similar to
   imprisonment, including both adverse and positive effects on earnings.
   We estimate that parolees lost approximately 37 percent of their
   earnings in quarters during which they were in short-term custody.
   Although their earnings tended to increase in the quarter immediately
   following short-term custody-consistent with the stated intentions of
   such sanctions-parolees experienced further earnings loss over the
   longer term after such sanctions. In the third quarter following a
   short-term custody sanction, earnings are lowered by about 13 percent.
   These associations are larger for those who were employed in the formal
   labor market before their initial incarceration.

AB Based on an in-depth study with 56 informants (25 women and 31 men),
   across the ICT (information and communication technology), creative and
   academic sectors in one city/regional hub in Ireland, this article
   investigates the so-called revolution in work/life practices associated
   with the post-Fordist labour processes of the Knowledge Economy from the
   perspectives of workers themselves. Recent theorizations of post-Fordist
   work patterns emphasize a rearranging of work and life place boundaries;
   a reconfiguring of work and life time boundaries; and a dissolving of
   the gendered boundaries of work and life (production and social
   reproduction) (Adkins and Dever ; Morini and Fumagalli ; Gill and Pratt
   ; Weeks ; Hardt and Negri ). Our findings suggest that, instead of
   dissolving boundaries, workers constantly struggle to draw boundaries
   between what counts as work and as life, and that this varies primarily
   in relation to gender and stage in a gendered life trajectory. Work
   extensification is compensated for via a perceived freedom to shape
   one's own life, which is articulated in terms of individualized
   boundary-drawing. While younger men embraced always on' work, they also
   articulated anxieties about how these work habits might interfere with
   family aspirations. This was also true for younger women who also
   struggled to make time for life in the present. For mothers, boundary
   drawing was articulated as a necessity but was framed more in terms of
   personal choice by fathers. Although all participants distinguished
   between paid work and life as distinct sites of value, boundaries were
   individually drawn and resist any easy mapping of masculinity and
   femininity onto the domains of work and life. Instead, we argue that it
   is the process of boundary drawing that reveals gendered patterns. The
   personalized struggles of these relatively privileged middle-class
   workers centre on improving the quality of their lives, but raise
   important questions about the political possibilities within and beyond
   the world of post-Fordist labour.

AB Monetary financing - the funding of state expenditure via the creation
   of new money rather than through taxation or borrowing - has become a
   taboo policy instrument in advanced economies. It is generally
   associated with dangerously high inflation and/or war. Relatedly, a key
   institutional feature of modern independent central banks is that they
   are not obligated to support government expenditure via money creation.
   Since the financial crisis of 2007-2008, however, unorthodox monetary
   policies, in particular quantitative easing, coupled with stagnant
   growth and high levels of public and private debt have led to questions
   over the monetary financing taboo. Debates on the topic have so far been
   mainly theoretical with little attention to the social and political
   dynamics of historical instances of monetary financing. This paper
   analyses one of the most significant twentieth-century cases: Canada
   from the period after the Great Depression up until the monetarist
   revolution of the 1970s. The period was a successful one for the
   Canadian economy, with high growth and employment and manageable
   inflation. It offers some interesting insights into the relationship
   between states and central banks and present-day discussions around the
   governance of money creation.

AB Financialization and neoliberal policy created the Celtic Tiger. This
   economic miracle' furthered creditors' and property developers'
   speculative interests, leading to an unstable financial pyramid that
   eventually imploded in 2008 with catastrophic consequences for Irish
   society. Using the sociological imagination as social critique, this
   paper offers a lens on fictitious capital and Ponzi finance in the
   context of Ireland's boom and bust. Critique is advanced using the
   Madoffization of society thesis, a sociological heuristic that draws
   formal comparisons between Bernie Madoff's US$65 billion Ponzi scheme,
   which collapsed in 2008, and financialized capitalism. The Madoff case
   exhibits five main elements or forms which, it has been argued, underlie
   the varying content of life on a much broader scale: accumulation by
   debt expansion, mass deception, efforts to maintain secrecy and silence,
   obfuscation, and scapegoating. In conclusion, a crucial difference
   between the Madoff case and the Madoffization of Irish society is
   underscored. Discussion also moves from critique to hope amidst calls to
   renew sociology and transform financialized capitalism.

AB What motivates corporate political action? Are corporations motivated by
   their own narrow economic self-interest; are they committed to pursuing
   larger class interests; or are corporations instruments for status
   groups to pursue their own agendas? Sociologists have been divided over
   this question for much of the last century. This paper introduces a
   novel case - that of Australia - and an extensive dataset of over 1,500
   corporations and 7,500 directors. The paper attempts to understand the
   motives of corporate political action by examining patterns of corporate
   political donations. Using statistical modelling, supported by
   qualitative evidence, the paper argues that, in the Australian case,
   corporate political action is largely motivated by the narrow economic
   self-interest of individual corporations. Firms' interests are,
   consistent with regulatory environment theory, defined by the nature of
   government regulation in their industry: those in highly regulated
   industries (such as banking) and those dependent on government support
   (such as defence) tend to adopt a strategy of hedging their political
   support, and make bipartisan donations (to both major parties). In
   contrast, firms facing hostile regulation (such as timber or mining),
   and those without strong dependence on state support (such as small
   companies) tend to adopt a strategy of conservative partisanship, and
   make conservative-only donations. This paper argues that regulatory
   environment theory needs to be modified to incorporate greater emphasis
   on the subjective political judgements of corporations facing hostile
   regulation: a corporation's adoption of conservative partisanship or
   hedging is not just a product of the objective regulation they face, but
   also whether corporate leaders judge such regulation as politically
   inevitable or something that can be resisted. Such a judgement is highly
   subjective, introducing a dynamic and unpredictable dimension to
   corporate political action.

AB Sociological debates on youth engagement with electoral politics play
   out against a backdrop of supposed decline' in civic participation (e.g.
   Putnam , Norris, ), in turn contextualized by theories of
   individualization in late' or reflexive' modernity (Beck, Giddens).
   However, the enfranchisement of 16 and 17 year olds in the 2014 Scottish
   Independence Referendum catalysed remarkably high levels of voter
   turnout among this youngest group, and was accompanied by apparently
   ongoing political engagement. We explored this engagement among a
   strategic sample of young Yes' voters, in the immediate aftermath of
   this exceptional political event. Analysis of qualitative interview data
   generated an unanticipated finding; that interviewees narrated their
   political engagement biographically, articulated their referendum
   participation reflexively, and located their new political ideas,
   allegiances and actions in the context of their own transitions to
   independent' adulthood. This inspired us to rethink young people's
   political engagement in relation to youth transitions. Doing so enables
   a synthesis of divergent strands in the sociology of youth, and offers
   new insights into the combinations of personal' agentic and political'
   structural factors involved in young people's politicization.

AB The wage differential between women and men persists in advanced
   economies despite the inflow of women into qualified occupations in
   recent years. Using five waves of the Swedish Level-of-Living Survey
   (LNU), this paper explores the gender wage gap in Sweden during the
   1974-2010 period overall and by skill level. The empirical analyses
   showed that the general gender wage gap has been nearly unchanged for
   the past 30 years. However, the gender difference in wage in less
   qualified occupations fell considerably, whereas the gender pay gap
   remained stable for men and women in qualified occupations. The larger
   significance of family responsibilities for wages in qualified
   occupations is one likely explanation for this result.

AB The interests of historically disadvantaged groups risk being overlooked
   if they are not present in the decision-making process. However, a mere
   presence in politics does not guarantee political success. Often groups
   need allies to promote their interests successfully. We argue that one
   way to identify such allies is to judge politicians by whether they have
   friends in historically disadvantaged groups, as intergroup friendships
   have been shown to make people understand and feel empathy for
   outgroups. In other words, intergroup friendships may function as an
   important complement to descriptive representation. We test our argument
   with a unique survey that asks all elected political representatives in
   Sweden's 290 municipalities (response rate 79 per cent) about their
   friendship ties to, and their representation of, five historically
   disadvantaged groups: women, immigrants, youths, pensioners and
   blue-collar workers. We find a strong correlation between
   representatives' friendship ties to these groups and their commitment to
   represent them. The correlation is especially strong for youths and
   blue-collar workers, which likely can be explained by the fact that
   these groups usually lack crucial political resources (such as
   experience and education). We conclude that friendship ties function as
   an important complement to descriptive representation for achieving
   substantive representation.

AB Income inequality has increased dramatically in the United States since
   the mid-1970s. This remarkable change in the distribution of household
   income has spurred a great deal of research on the social and economic
   consequences of exposure to high inequality. However, the empirical
   record on the effects of income inequality is mixed. In this paper, we
   suggest that previous research has generally overlooked a simple but
   important pathway through which inequality might manifest in daily life:
   inequality shapes the ability of women to outsource domestic labor by
   hiring others to perform it. One important venue where such dynamics
   might then manifest is in time spent on housework, and in particular in
   the time divide in housework between women of high and low
   socio-economic status. We combine micro-data from the 2003-2013 American
   Time Use Survey with area-level data on income inequality to show that
   the class divide in housework time between women with a college degree
   and from high-earning households and women of lower socio-economic
   status is wider in more unequal places. We further assess whether this
   gap can be explained by domestic outsourcing by combining micro-data
   from the 2003-2013 Consumer Expenditure Survey with area-level data on
   income inequality and show that the gap in spending for household
   services between households of high and low socio-economic status also
   increases in contexts of higher inequality.

AB To supplement funding and strengthen relationships with the community,
   police departments often accept donations from individuals and
   businesses. These donations are a form of disreputable exchange: they
   are permitted but laden with the potential for controversy. Gift-giving
   is generally forbidden in public agencies because it conflicts with
   bureaucratic organizational principles of impersonality and fairness and
   equality before the law. Accepting donations, therefore, requires
   mechanisms to purify them, ensuring that there is no reciprocity, while
   at the same time motivating and acknowledging the bond with donors. In
   this paper, we analyze the management strategies established by a police
   department in Canada to maintain and encourage donations while
   preventing reciprocity and minimizing the possibility that gifts are
   interpreted as bribes. We identify four management strategies:
   institutional separation via recognized charity organizations; denial of
   reciprocity; limits on donation use; and screening the giver.

AB In academia, there remains a gender gap in promotion to tenure, such
   that men are more likely to receive tenure than women. This paper tests
   three explanations of this gender gap in promotion: (1) contextual and
   organizational differences across departments; (2)
   performance/productivity differences by gender; and (3) gendered
   inequality in evaluation. To test these explanations, this project uses
   a novel dataset drawing from a sample of assistant professors in
   Sociology, Computer Science, and English, across research universities.
   This dataset combines data from sources including curriculum vitae,
   Google Scholar, and web archive employment data, resulting in a dataset
   of assistant professors' publication records, department affiliations,
   and job positions. Analyses examine the gender gap in the likelihood of
   promotion to tenure and in early career trajectories, while accounting
   for publication productivity and department/university context. The
   results demonstrate that productivity measures account for a portion of
   the gender gap in tenure, but in each discipline a substantial share of
   the gender gap remains unexplained by these factors. Department
   characteristics do not explain the tenure gender gap. Further, when
   women do receive tenure, they do so in lower-prestige departments than
   men, on average. These findings suggest that gendered inequality in the
   tenure evaluation process contributes to the gender gap in tenure rates.

AB The paper provides new empirical evidence on the educational backgrounds

   senior executives drawn from 15 sectors, including government, we find
   significant industry variation. Industries whose products depend
   primarily on the manipulation of symbolic media were the most likely to
   recruit from elite colleges. By contrast, industries involved in the
   transformation of the material world recruited less often from elite
   colleges, and this was particularly true for industries that employed
   comparatively few workers with advanced degrees. We find a relatively
   low level of association between elite undergraduate origins and
   executive positions in economy and state but greater proportional
   concentration by graduate business or law school attended. We discuss
   the different selection criteria used by elite colleges looking for
   outstanding students and corporations looking for outstanding
   executives, as well as additional layers of affinity that may lie behind
   industry differences in recruitment to executive positions.

AB Previous research on birth order has consistently shown that later-borns
   have lower educational attainment than first-borns; however, it is not
   known whether there are birth order patterns in college major. Given
   evidence that parents disproportionately invest in first-born children,
   there are likely to be birth order patterns attributable to differences
   in both opportunities and preferences, related to ability, human capital
   specialization through parent-child transfers of knowledge, and
   personality. Birth order patterns in college major specialization may
   shed light on these explanatory mechanisms and may also account for
   long-term birth order differences in educational and labour market
   outcomes. Using Swedish population register data and sibling fixed
   effects, we find large birth order differences in university
   applications. First-borns are more likely to apply to, and graduate
   from, medicine and engineering programs at university, while later-borns
   are more likely to study journalism and business programs, and to attend
   art school. We also find that these birth order patterns are stronger in
   high-socioeconomic status families and that differences in college major
   explain approximately half of the within-family birth order differences
   in long-term earnings. These results indicate that early life
   experiences and parental investment shape sibling differences in
   ability, preferences, and ambitions even within the shared environment
   of the family.

AB College selectivity is associated with numerous positive life outcomes,
   but research on the antecedents of college selectivity, including
   religion, is limited-despite a long tradition of religion and
   stratification research. Using survey data from the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 2,093) and
   semi-structured interviews from the National Study of Youth and Religion
   (N = 46), we test for and explain differences in the college selectivity
   of students from conservative Protestant (CP) religious backgrounds
   compared to others. We hypothesize that CPs attend less selective
   colleges than other young adults, and that this may especially be the
   case among women. Our quantitative findings suggest CPs do attend less
   selective colleges, and the difference is greater among those with
   better high school GPAs. However, these differences are nonexistent for
   men once background factors are controlled. CP women attend less
   selective colleges than other women-a difference that is even larger
   among women with higher academic ability. Our qualitative findings
   suggest that these differences stem from young women's different
   understandings of the purposes of college (general self-betterment
   versus human capital investment), which relate to unique strategies for
   balancing work and family, enacting altruism, and achieving
   self-satisfaction. These findings show the continued link between
   religion and stratification and, more broadly, culture and

AB An important explanation for immigrants' wage disadvantage is that human
   capital acquired in the country of origin is not fully transferable to
   the country of destination. Credentialing theories, on the other hand,
   argue that being educated abroad results in lower wages because foreign
   degrees are weaker signals to employers and might impede formal access
   to occupations. In this study, we use the Programme for the
   International Assessment of Adult Competencies 2012 (PIAAC) data and
   include-besides educational degrees-measures of cognitive,
   non-cognitive, and job-specific skills to explain wages. In our analysis
   of 11 European countries, we find robust evidence that having a
   non-Western foreign degree is associated with lower wages. After
   accounting for different types of skills, the wage penalty associated
   with having a foreign degree remains substantial, as skills explain only
   a third of the place of education effect. This finding is in line with
   the argument that being educated abroad results in lower wages because
   of not only the limited transferability of skills, but also the limited
   transferability of degrees.

AB This study analyzes the persistence of educational inequality in

   education systems. Using Denmark as a case, we investigate changes in
   immobility patterns for cohorts born 1960-1981 and develop a new
   micro-educational classification capturing both hierarchical and
   horizontal forms of educational differentiation. To investigate the
   association between parents' and children's educational status, we apply
   log linear models and control for four types of educational immobility:
   gradational (by returns to education), aggregated (5 macro-educational
   levels), horizontal (19 fields of study), and disaggregated (62
   micro-educations). Our findings show that while macro-educational
   immobility has decreased across the period, micro-educational immobility
   at the university and university college levels remains high and stable,
   in particular for sons. We also find great variation in immobility for
   specific micro-educations within the university level. Studies of
   educational immobility would therefore benefit from paying attention to
   micro-educational classifications, because they capture patterns of
   multidimensional, disaggregated forms of reproduction. In addition, the
   micro-educational approach far better explains the immobility of sons
   than it explains that of daughters, revealing important gender
   differences in the immobility patterns for sons and daughters.

AB Extensive scholarship addresses whether and how social movements can
   have consequences for outcomes of interest to them. Though divided in
   its conclusions, existing research generally shares a focus on potential
   contributions of movements to the codification of rights and adoption of
   policies, rather than their actual implementation. Often, however,
   palpable enactment of the crystallized laws and policies that movements
   demand is far from guaranteed, raising salient questions about whether
   and how movements can matter for implementation outcomes as well. To
   address such questions, the article uses a mixed-methods analysis to
   examine consequences of subnational office-holding by "sanitarista"
   activists from the Sanitarist Movement-contemporary Brazil's most
   important health movement-for rates of primary public health coverage
   and childhood mortality. Before reviewing existing theories and
   conceptualizing movement office-holding, it briefly describes the
   movement's role in codifying Brazil's constitutional right to health and
   demanding new local democratic institutions for enacting that right.
   Then, Prais-Winsten regression analyses of all major Brazilian capitals
   between 1995 and 2014 show that sanitarista office-holding atop a key
   subnational institution was associated with broader health service
   coverage and lower mortality. Comparative case-study analysis
   illustrates that office-holding sanitaristas helped generate these
   improvements by leveraging new democratic offices to marshal support of
   subnational executives for the movement's modest but effective
   state-building project in the municipal health sector. Ultimately,
   theories of movement consequences benefit from considering how in
   certain democratic contexts, subnational office-holding can constitute
   an important standalone outcome with considerable promise to also
   improve policy implementation and social development.

AB Despite efforts by protesters to develop newsworthy tactics, there is
   ample evidence that reporters use a few well-defined scripts to
   construct stories on these events. The institutionalization of protest
   has only served to amplify the routinization of media coverage. How then
   do reporters address emergent forms of collective action that fail to
   conform to existing scripts? The current research investigates this
   phenomenon by comparing the language used to describe protest in major
   American cities and disturbances on college and university campuses.
   Colleges and universities have seen an upsurge of these events, such as
   disorderly celebrations following sporting contests. In contrast,
   protest has become increasingly institutionalized. As a consequence, we
   suspected that coverage of campus community disturbances would draw much
   more heavily on language that portrays them as dangerous than would
   coverage of protests. Our analysis of newspaper coverage reveals that
   even when taking into consideration important event features like the
   behaviors of police and civilians, protests are covered in a far more
   routine fashion than are campus community riots, a condition that holds
   even for the most contentious protest events. These findings provide
   important insights into the interplay of collective action and media
   attention, and are especially timely given the recent rise of more
   contentious events such as the #blacklivesmatter protests.

AB Under which conditions do social movements receive coverage by the

   political, cultural, and organizational reasons, but only rarely have
   scholars analyzed the coverage of movements comparatively and at the
   movement level. To address the question, we apply a political mediation
   model of the influence of movements to professional news media, using
   ideas from the social organization of the news perspective. From this
   model, we hypothesize four main multicausal paths to extensive coverage
   for movements. These involve the joint occurrence of two specific
   movement characteristics-disruptive capacities and extensive
   organization-and two specific political contexts-unified partisan
   regimes and enforced policies. Working from scholarship that argues that
   rightist movements have different determinants, we also devise
   hypotheses for their coverage. These hypotheses are appraised through
   qualitative comparative analyses on an updated Political Organizations
   in the News data set. The latter includes information on all the
   coverage of national US movement organizations in four major national
   newspapers across the twentieth century. These analyses provide
   extensive support for the mediation model and support claims that
   rightist movements have separate and in some ways more difficult routes
   to extensive news coverage.

AB Garrett Hardin's 1968 essay "The Tragedy of the Commons" famously
   decried the vulnerability of finite communal resources to
   overexploitation. Yet collective accessibility to and ownership of
   resources need not necessarily lead to their mismanagement or abuse;
   rather, the practice of sharing resources can engender positive
   environmental, social, economic, and political impacts. Social capital,
   as both the source and product of relational interactions which occur
   within public space, constitutes one of these benefits.
   This paper investigates the relationship between temporary communal
   spaces and social capital through a case study of the Commons project in
   Christchurch, New Zealand. Generated by both the space itself and the
   interactions that occur within it, the social capital created in and
   through the Commons has become a powerful symbol of recovery in a city
   recovering from disaster. Instead of the tragedy of the commons,
   therefore, this paper presents the story of the Commons of the tragedy
   and explores the ways in which social capital has been fostered in and
   through this space.

AB The built environment that serves as the literal foundation for social
   life involves not just the material development of local landscapes but
   ongoing damage from natural hazards endemic to these landscapes, which
   are forecasted to increase over coming years. Prior research has
   investigated each of these dynamics independently but not their
   intersection. The present study begins to fill this gap by combining
   county-level data on land development with that on natural hazard damage
   to assess how these two dimensions of local landscape transformation
   unfold together over time. Results from spatial panel regression and
   structural equation models indicate that on average and net of past
   trends and time-invariant factors, natural hazard damages tend to
   accelerate local land development in ways that feed back and scale up
   successively over time, especially onto formerly undeveloped lands.
   Implications for future landscape transformation and research are
   discussed.

AB The proliferation of cultural objects, such as music, books, film, and
   websites, has created a new problem: How do consumers determine the
   value of cultural objects in an age of information glut?
   Crowd-sourcing-paralleling word-of-mouth recommendations-has taken
   center stage, yet expert opinion has also assumed renewed importance.
   Prior work on the valuation of artworks and other cultural artifacts
   identifies ways critics establish and maintain classificatory
   boundaries, such as genre. We extend this research by offering a
   theoretical approach emphasizing the dynamics of critics' valuation and
   classification. Empirically, this analysis turns to Pitchfork.com, an
   influential music review website, to examine the relationship between
   classification and valuation. Using topic models of fourteen years of
   Pitchfork.com album reviews (n = 14,495), we model the dynamics of
   valuation through genre and additional factors predictive of positive
   reviews and cultural consecration. We use gold-record awards to study
   the relationship between valuation processes and commercial outcomes.
   Conclusions highlight the role of professional critics, alongside
   crowd-sourcing and other forms of criticism, in the dynamic process of
   valuation and encourage the continued exploration of fruitful ways to
   connect computational and more canonical ways of conducting sociological
   research.

AB This paper derives optimal income tax and human capital policies in a
   life cycle model with risky human capital. The government faces
   asymmetric information regarding agents' ability, its evolution, and
   labor supply. When the wage elasticity with respect to ability is
   increasing in human capital, the optimal subsidy involves less than full
   deductibility of human capital expenses on the tax base and falls with
   age. Income contingent loans or a deferred deductibility scheme can
   implement the optimum. Numerical results suggest that full deductibility
   of expenses is close to optimal and that simple linear age -dependent
   policies perform very well.

   construct a theoretical model of these clearinghouse mechanisms and show
   that the specific decentralized multilateral clearing algorithms known
   as rescontre, skontrieren, or virement des parties, used by merchants in
   this period, were efficient in specific historical contexts. Our
   analysis contributes to the understanding of these mechanisms during
   late medieval and early modern fairs and their robustness during the

AB This paper investigates the origin id propagation of balance sheet
   recessions. I first show that in standard models driven by TFP shocks,
   the balance sheet channel disappears when agents can write contracts on
   the aggregate state of the economy. Optimal contracts sever the link
   between leverage and aggregate risk sharing, eliminating the
   concentration of aggregate risk that drives balance sheet recessions. I
   then show that uncertainty shocks can help explain this concentration of
   aggregate risk and drive balance sheet recessions, even with contracts
   on aggregate shocks. The mechanism is quantitatively important, and I
   explore implications for financial regulation.

AB Financial constraints are considered an important impediment to growth
   for small businesses. We study theoretically and empirically the
   relationship between the financial constraints of agents and the
   organizational decisions and growth of principals, in the context of
   franchising. We find that a 30 percent decrease in average
   collateralizable housing wealth in an area is associated with a delay in
   chains' entry into franchising by 0.33 year on average, or 10 percent of
   the average waiting time, and a reduction in chain growth and hence a
   reduction in franchised chain employment of about 9 percent.

AB To study the impact of macroprudential policy on credit supply cycles
   and real effects, we analyze dynamic provisioning. Introduced in Spain
   in 2000, revised four times, and tested in its countercyclicality during
   the crisis, it affected banks differentially. We find that dynamic
   provisioning smooths credit supply cycles and, in had times, supports
   firm performance. A 1 percentage point increase in capital buffers
   extends credit to firms by 9 percentage points, increasing firm
   employment (6 percentage points) and survival (1 percentage point).
   Moreover, there are important compositional effects in credit supply
   related to risk and regulatory arbitrage by nonregulated and regulated
   but less affected banks.

AB I provide new evidence on the relative "powers" of contraception and
   abortion policy in effecting the dramatic social transformations of the.
   1960s and 1970s. Trends in sexual behavior suggest that young worn en's
   increased access to the birth control pill fueled the sexual revolution,
   but neither these trends nor difference -in -difference estimates
   support the view that this also led to substantial changes in family
   formation. Rather, the estimates robustly suggest that it was
   liberalized access to abortion that allowed large numbers of women to
   delay marriage and motherhood.

AB Based on an innovative design, combining a multi-factorial survey
   experiment with a longitudinal perspective, we examine changes in the
   public acceptance of immigrants in Germany from the beginning of the
   so-called 'migration crisis' to after the sexual assaults of New Year's
   Eve (NYE) 2015/2016. In contrast to previous studies investigating
   similar research questions, our approach allows to differentiate changes
   along various immigrant characteristics. Derived from discussions making
   up the German immigration discourse during this time, we expect reduced
   acceptance especially of those immigrants who were explicitly connected
   to the salient events, like Muslims and the offenders of NYE. Most
   strikingly, we find that refugees were generally highly accepted and
   even more so in the second wave, whereas the acceptance of immigrants
   from Arab or African countries further decreased. Moreover, female
   respondents' initial preference for male immigrants disappeared.
   Contrary to our expectations, we find no changes in the acceptance of
   Muslims. We conclude that (i) public opinion research is well advised to
   match the particular political and social context under investigation to
   a fitting outcome variable to adequately capture the dynamics of
   anti-immigrant sentiment and that (ii) the vividly discussed upper
   limits for refugees seem to be contrary to public demands according to
   our data.

AB The emergence of large-scale cooperation in humans poses a major puzzle
   for the social and behavioural sciences. Reputation
   formation-individuals' ability to share information about others' deeds
   and misdeeds-has been found to promote cooperation. However, these
   findings are mostly based on small-scale laboratory and field
   experiments or on data gathered from online markets embedded in
   functioning legal systems. Using a unique data set of transactions in a
   cryptomarket for illegal drugs, we analyse the effect of buyers' ratings
   of finished transactions on sellers' business success. Cryptomarkets are
   online marketplaces in the so-called Dark Web, which can only be
   accessed by means of encryption software that conceals users' identities
   and locations. The encryption technology makes it virtually impossible
   for law enforcement to intervene in these market exchanges. We find that
   sellers with a better rating history charge higher prices and sell their
   merchandise faster than sellers with no or a bad rating history. Our
   results demonstrate how reputation creates real incentives for
   cooperative behaviour at a large scale, in the absence of law
   enforcement and among anonymous actors with doubtful intentions. Our
   results thus challenge the institutional and social embeddedness of
   actors as necessary preconditions for the emergence of social order in
   markets.

AB Informal learning, the self-initiated acquisition of knowledge, takes a
   central position in political and scientific debates on skill formation.
   Human capital theory argues that informal learning increases skills and
   thereby will positively affect returns in the labour market. Signalling
   and closure theories do not expect returns to informal learning, as
   informal learning does not result in a formal degree. So far only a few
   studies have empirically investigated how informal learning affects
   labour market outcomes, all of them applying a cross-sectional design.
   By using the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we model
   the returns to three forms of informal learning in person fixed-effects
   models, thereby reducing problems of selection into informal learning.
   We find that up to 33 per cent of the respondents engage in at least one
   form of professional purpose informal learning. While participation is
   high, the effects on labour market returns are negligible. We find a
   very small positive effect of one of the three types of informal
   learning on employment, and we find no effect of informal learning on
   wages.

AB Stigma and negative stereotypes about unemployed people are likely to be
   distressing for individuals who experience unemployment. Nevertheless,
   empirical research on factors affecting unemployment stereotypes is
   surprisingly sparse. This article investigates an important aspect,
   namely, how personal and vicarious experiences with unemployment affect
   individuals' generalized perceptions of unemployed people. The analysis
   is based on a unique data set consisting of panel survey data connected
   to rich, objective data regarding unemployment trajectories of both
   survey respondents and their relatives. It shows that both experiencing
   unemployment personally and having relatives who experience unemployment
   make individuals' generalized perceptions of unemployed people
   significantly more positive. Moreover, subsequent analyses tentatively
   indicate that the effects fade when personal and vicarious unemployment
   experiences terminate.

AB In this article, we analyse whether and how, in the context of high
   female labour market participation and competing exit pathways, Finnish
   women's retirement differs from men's. We test for the influence of
   gendered life courses, social stratification, late career vulnerability,
   and sector. Using data from the Finnish Centre for Pensions, we created
   individual sequences of monthly income statuses between ages 57 and 65
   for a cohort born in 1948 (N = 55,971). Following sequence analysis, we
   identified eight distinct trajectory clusters that represent the variety
   of labour market withdrawal through the competing exit pathways. We
   linked these clusters to a set of sociodemographic background variables
   from Finnish Longitudinal Employer-Employee Data. We find that women's
   retirement trajectories do not differ substantially from men's, but that
   the factors affecting the take-up of those trajectories show significant
   differences. Marital status, education, income, and especially public
   sector employment play a greater role in determining the timing and mode
   of women's retirement. The findings suggest that women's retirement is
   different because their marital status, education, and income have a
   stronger effect on their attachment to the labour market and because
   they work in particular female-dominated occupations.

AB Previous research has demonstrated that parental socio-economic status
   (SES) is an important determinant of the timing of entry into a first
   co-residential union. Whilst the majority of existing studies found that
   young adults from high-SES families delay their first union compared
   with those from lower-SES backgrounds, all these studies were conducted
   within a single country. This study examines the link between parental
   SES and the timing and type of first union for 25 European countries
   participating in the European Social Survey Round 3 (2006/2007). Results
   from two-step meta-analytical models indicate that in almost all
   countries young adults from advantaged backgrounds delay their entry
   into a first union. This delaying effect of parental SES is stronger if
   young adults marry directly than if they enter their first union via
   unmarried cohabitation. The impact of parental SES is only partly
   mediated by an individual's own education. The strength of the link
   between parental SES and union formation varies between countries: the
   delaying impact of parental SES is weakest in those Northern and Western
   European countries that are most advanced in the Second Demographic
   Transition. However, after controlling for individual education, the
   cross-national variation in the link between parental SES and union
   formation disappears.

AB We examine the connection between fatherhood and employment hours using
   30 years of data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP 1985-2014).
   By inspecting how actual hours, preferred hours, and the correspondence
   between actual and preferred hours change during fatherhood, we clarify
   the interplay between fathers' preferences and the labour market
   structures they encounter. We find that men born in 1960 or earlier
   prefer to (and are able to) increase their work hours slightly when they
   are fathers. Men born after 1960, in contrast, tend to prefer and
   achieve a slight reduction in work hours. Changes in fathers' actual and
   preferred work hours, however, are not an individual decision: they
   reflect the paid work involvement of their partners. Men in the older
   cohort only increase their hours significantly when their partner is not
   employed. Men in the younger cohort only reduce their hours
   significantly when their partner works full-time. Changes in fathers'
   work hours thus have become more supportive of wives' employment, but
   the size of fathers' work hour reductions remains substantively small.
   While our results suggest Germany is making progress towards equitable
   gender arrangements in the division of paid work, this progress remains
   slow.

AB Junior faculty search committees serve as gatekeepers to the
   professoriate and play vital roles in shaping the demographic
   composition of academic departments and disciplines, but how committees
   select new hires has received minimal scholarly attention. In this
   article, I highlight one mechanism of gender inequalities in academic
   hiring: relationship status discrimination. Through a qualitative case
   study of junior faculty search committees at a large R1 university, I
   show that committees actively considered women's-but not
   men's-relationship status when selecting hires. Drawing from gendered
   scripts of career and family that present men's careers as taking
   precedence over women's, committee members assumed that heterosexual
   women whose partners held academic or high-status jobs were not
   "movable," and excluded such women from offers when there were viable
   male or single female alternatives. Conversely, committees infrequently
   discussed male applicants' relationship status and saw all female
   partners as movable. Consequently, I show that the "two-body problem" is
   a gendered phenomenon embedded in cultural stereotypes and
   organizational practices that can disadvantage women in academic hiring.
   I conclude by discussing the implications of such relationship status
   discrimination for sociological research on labor market inequalities
   and faculty diversity.

AB Concentrated in adolescence, violent victimization is developmentally
   disruptive. It undermines physical, mental, and socioemotional
   well-being and compromises youths' transitions into and progression
   through key life course tasks. Youth violent victimization (YVV) has
   been linked to precocious exits from adolescence and premature entries
   into adulthood. This includes early entry into coresidential romantic
   unions, which is but one stage of a relationship sequence generally
   beginning via dating debut. Using data from the National Longitudinal
   Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) and Cox regression, we
   examine the effects of YVV on the timing of dating debut and progression
   to first coresidential unions during adolescence and the transition to
   adulthood. We pay particular attention to how these effects may be
   structured by age and gender. Overall, we find that victims begin dating
   sooner and progress more quickly from dating to first unions than do
   non-victims. However, youths victimized in early adolescence withdraw
   from dating and union formation, whereas late adolescent victims appear
   to overinvest in relationships-at least temporarily-displaying
   accelerated entry into dating and rapid progression to first unions. We
   conclude by discussing the implication of these age-graded patterns for
   intervention efforts and youth well-being more broadly.

   Who's Whoa unique catalogue of the British elite-to explore the changing
   relationship between elite schools and elite recruitment. We find that
   the propulsive power of Britain's public schools has diminished
   significantly over time. This is driven in part by the wane of military
   and religious elites, and the rise of women in the labor force. However,
   the most dramatic declines followed key educational reforms that
   increased access to the credentials needed to access elite trajectories,
   while also standardizing and differentiating them. Notwithstanding these
   changes, public schools remain extraordinarily powerful channels of
   elite formation. Even today, the alumni of the nine Clarendon schools
   are 94 times more likely to reach the British elite than are those who
   attended any other school. Alumni of elite schools also retain a
   striking capacity to enter the elite even without passing through other
   prestigious institutions, such as Oxford, Cambridge, or private members
   clubs. Our analysis not only points to the dogged persistence of the
   "old boy," but also underlines the theoretical importance of reviving

AB Do advocacy organizations stimulate public conversation about social
   problems by engaging in rational debate, or by appealing to emotions? We
   argue that rational and emotional styles of communication ebb and flow
   within public discussions about social problems due to the alternating
   influence of social contagion and saturation effects. These
   "cognitive-emotional currents" create an opportunity structure whereby
   advocacy organizations stimulate more conversation if they produce
   emotional messages after prolonged rational debate or vice versa. We
   test this hypothesis using automated text-analysis techniques that
   measure the frequency of cognitive and emotional language within two
   advocacy fields on Facebook over 1.5 years, and a web-based application
   that offered these organizations a complimentary audit of their social
   media outreach in return for sharing nonpublic data about themselves,
   their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which
   they interact. Time-series models reveal strong support for our
   hypothesis, controlling for 33 confounding factors measured by our

AB Largely overlooked in the theoretical and empirical literature on the

   sociology that considers how violence is regulated through informal
   sources of social control arising from residents and organizations

   model of community life into debates on the U.S. crime drop, and we
   focus on the role that local nonprofit organizations played in the
   national decline of violence from the 1990s to the 2010s. Using
   longitudinal data and a strategy to account for the endogeneity of
   nonprofit formation, we estimate the causal effect on violent crime of
   nonprofits focused on reducing violence and building stronger
   communities. Drawing on a panel of 264 cities spanning more than 20
   years, we estimate that every 10 additional organizations focusing on
   crime and community life in a city with 100,000 residents leads to a 9

AB High-dose vitamin A supplementation (VAS) may affect mortality to
   infectious diseases in a sex-differential manner. Here, we analysed the
   long-term immunological effects of neonatal vitamin A supplementation
   (NVAS) in 247 children, who had been randomly allocated to 50 000 or 25
   000 IU vitamin A (15mg and 7·5mg retinol equivalents, respectively) or
   placebo at birth. At 4-6 months of age, we assessed bacille
   Calmette-Guerin (BCG) scarification, and we analysed in vitro responses
   of TNF-alpha, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-gamma in whole blood
   stimulations to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), purified protein derivative
   (PPD), tetanus toxoid and lipopolysaccharide. There were no differences
   between the two doses of NVAS, and thus they were analysed combined as
   NVAS (any dose) v. placebo. All analyses were performed unstratified and
   by sex. NVAS increased the chance of having a scar after BCG vaccination
   in females (NVAS v. placebo: 96 v. 71 %, proportion ratio: 1·24; 95 % CI
   1·09, 1·42), but not in males (P for interaction=0·012). NVAS was
   associated with significant sex-differential effects on the pro- to
   anti-inflammatory cytokine ratios (TNF-alpha:IL-10) to PPD, tetanus
   toxoid and medium alone, which were increased in females but decreased
   in males. In addition, IL-17 responses tended to be increased in NVAS v.
   placebo recipients in males but not in females, significantly so for the
   PHA stimulation. The study corroborates sex-differential effects of VAS
   on the immune system, emphasising the importance of analysing VAS
   effects by sex.

AB This paper examines how sales force impacts competition and equilibrium
   prices in the context of a privatized pension market. We use detailed
   administrative data on fund manager choices and worker characteristics
   at the inception of Mexico's privatized social security system, where
   fund managers had to set prices (management fees) at the national level,
   but could select sales force levels by local geographic areas. We
   develop and estimate a model of fund manager choice where sales force
   can increase or decrease customer price sensitivity. We find exposure to
   sales force lowered price sensitivity, leading to inelastic demand and
   high equilibrium fees. We simulate oft proposed policy solutions: a
   supply-side policy with a competitive government player and a
   demand-side policy that increases price elasticity. We find that
   demand-side policies are necessary to foster competition in social
   safety net markets with large segments of inelastic consumers.

   decisions on wages, education, and an index of family attitudes. A
   match-specific, stochastic bliss shock induces variation in matching
   given wages, education, and family values, and triggers renegotiation
   and divorce. Using BHPS (1991-2008) data, we take as given changes in
   wages, education, and family values by gender, and study their impact on
   marriage decisions and intrahousehold resource allocation. The model
   allows to evaluate how much of the observed gender differences in labor
   supply results from wages, education, and family attitudes. We find that
   family attitudes are a strong determinant of comparative advantages in
   home production of men and women, whereas education complementarities
   induce assortative mating through preferences.

AB This paper studies the impact of time-varying idiosyncratic risk at the

   a tractable directed search model with firm dynamics and time-varying
   idiosyncratic volatility. The model allows for endogenous separations,
   entry and exit, and job-to-job transitions. I show that the model can
   replicate salient features of the microeconomic behavior of firms and
   that the introduction of volatility improves the fit of the model for
   standard business cycle moments. In a series of counterfactual
   experiments, I show that time-varying risk is important to account for
   the magnitude of fluctuations in aggregate unemployment for past U.S.
   recessions. Though the model can account for about 40% of the total
   increase in unemployment for the 2007-2009 recession, uncertainty alone
   is not sufficient to explain the magnitude and persistence of
   unemployment during that episode.

AB A mixed manna contains goods (that everyone likes) and bads (that
   everyone dislikes), as well as items that are goods to some agents, but
   bads or satiated to others. If all items are goods and utility functions
   are homogeneous of degree 1 and concave (and monotone), the competitive
   division maximizes the Nash product of utilities (Gale-Eisenberg): hence
   it is welfarist (determined by the set of feasible utility profiles),
   unique, continuous, and easy to compute. We show that the competitive
   division of a mixed manna is still welfarist. If the zero utility
   profile is Pareto dominated, the competitive profile is strictly
   positive and still uniquely maximizes the product of utilities. If the
   zero profile is unfeasible (for instance, if all items are bads), the
   competitive profiles are strictly negative and are the critical points
   of the product of disutilities on the efficiency frontier. The latter
   allows for multiple competitive utility profiles, from which no
   single-valued selection can be continuous or resource monotonic. Thus
   the implementation of competitive fairness under linear preferences in
   interactive platforms like SPLIDDIT will be more difficult when the
   manna contains bads that overwhelm the goods.

   situations with strict conflict of interest, formalized as stochastic
   zero-sum games where only one of the players observes the state that
   evolves according to a Markov operator. Operator Q is said to be better
   for the informed player than operator P if the value of the game under Q

   defines a convex partial order on the space of ergodic Markov operators.
   Our main result is a full characterization of this partial order,

AB Democracies widely differ in the extent to which powerful elites and
   interest groups retain influence over politics. While a large literature
   argues that elite capture is rooted in a country's history, our
   understanding of the determinants of elite persistence is limited. In
   this paper, we show that allowing old-regime agents to remain in office
   during democratic transitions is a key determinant of the extent of
   elite capture. We exploit quasi-random from Indonesia: Soeharto-regime
   mayors were allowed to finish their terms before being replaced by new
   leaders. Since mayors' political cycles were not synchronized, this
   event generated exogenous variation in how long old-regime mayors
   remained in their position during the democratic transition. Districts
   with longer exposure to old-regime mayors experience worse governance
   outcomes, higher elite persistence, and lower political competition in
   the medium run. The results suggest that slower transitions towards
   democracy allow the old-regime elites to capture democracy.

AB Neighborhood context can change the effect of a socio-demographic
   attribute on the risk of suicide. Eight hypotheses about the
   interactions between neighborhood composition, ethnicity, income, and
   socially disadvantaged propositions are proposed based on social
   support, social comparison, and social regulation mechanisms. They are
   tested with a population-based dataset of all adults (1.4 million) who
   lived in the greater Stockholm area in the 1990s. On one hand,
   multi-level analysis shows that suicide risk increases with the level of
   affluence in one's neighborhood, particularly among individuals with low
   income. This supports the notion that income comparison can have
   negative consequences. On the other hand, social welfare recipients are
   less likely to commit suicide when there are other social welfare
   recipients in the neighborhood. Suicide risk among immigrants decreases
   with the proportion of co-ethnics in the neighborhood, confirming
   previous findings on social support and suicide. However, further
   analyses show that the protection effect of having co-ethnic neighbors
   is limited to immigrants from countries with low suicide rates. This
   study shows that administrative data can be used to examine neighborhood
   effects on rare outcomes. The findings are relevant to the contemporary
   trends towards rising income inequality and ethnic diversity.

AB Why do the poor respond to some populist appeals and not to others?
   Populist support is largely attributed to a leader's populist style.
   Populist style is seen as consisting of tactics aimed at cultivating
   popular identification. This explanation, however, cannot tell us why
   the poor discriminate among leaders employing similar tactics. This
   article considers the question with respect to the Philippine populist
   Joseph Estrada. It finds that the poor support Estrada because they
   perceive him to be sincere, or someone who cares about them beyond
   electoral considerations. They see him as sincere because his political
   performance engages their expectations and has proven coherent over
   time. The collective nature of their belief in Estrada's sincerity helps
   account for its objectivity, durability, and diffusion. The empirical
   case presents an opportunity to develop a more sophisticated account of
   populist style and to show that it depends as much on the political
   savvy of supporters as on the skill of leaders.

AB This article develops a framework for analyzing the risks of poverty in
   terms of prevalences (share of the population with a risk) and penalties
   (increased probability of poverty associated with a risk). A comparison
   of the four major risks (low education, single motherhood, young
   headship, and unemployment) across 29 rich democracies reveals there is
   greater variation in penalties than prevalences. The United States has
   high poverty partly because it has the highest penalties despite below
   average prevalences. Also, U.S. poverty in 2013 would be worse with
   prevalences from 1970 or 1980. There is little evidence that penalties
   discourage prevalences, while welfare generosity significantly moderates
   the penalties for unemployment and low education. The authors conclude
   that a focus on risks does not provide a convincing explanation of
   poverty, single motherhood may be the least important of the risks, and
   studies based solely on the United States are constrained by potentially
   large sample selection biases.

AB Previous research on interaction behavior among organizations (resource
   exchange, collaboration, communication) has typically aggregated those
   behaviors over time as a network of organizational relationships. The
   authors instead study structural-temporal patterns in organizational
   exchange, focusing on the dynamics of reciprocation. Applying this lens
   to a community of Italian hospitals during 2003-7, the authors observe
   two mechanisms of interorganizational reciprocation: organizational
   embedding and resource dependence. The authors show how these two
   mechanisms operate on distinct time horizons: dependence applies to
   contemporaneous exchange structures, whereas embedding develops through
   longer-term historical patterns. They also show how these processes
   operate differently in competitive and noncompetitive contexts,
   operationalized in terms of market differentiation and geographic space.
   In noncompetitive contexts, the authors observe both logics of
   reciprocation, dependence in the short term and embedding over the long
