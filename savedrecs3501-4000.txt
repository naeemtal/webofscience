AB We contribute to the literature on positional goods and subjective
   well-being by providing new evidence on the following questions: Is the
   effect of income on subjective well-being mainly relative or absolute?
   Does the intensity of social comparison condition the effect of income
   on well-being? Does the reference group for comparison condition this
   effect? We present results from the Social Status, Consumption, and
   Happiness Survey, a national survey of Americans conducted in 2012. The
   findings suggest that the more highly individuals rate their income
   relative to others, the happier they are; that individuals who find it
   important to compare their income to that of others are less happy; and
   that the reference group that is salient for comparison conditions the
   association between income and well-being. We situate these findings in
   the literatures on the dynamics of inequality, social comparison, and
   well-being.

AB Research consistently demonstrates that black students are
   disproportionately subject to behavioral sanctions, yet little is known
   about contextual variation. This paper explores the relationship between
   school racial composition and racial inequality in discipline. Prior
   work suggests that demographic composition predicts harsh punishment of
   minorities. Accordingly, a threat framework suggests that increases in
   black student enrollment correspond to increases in punitive school
   policies. Results from this paper find some support for this hypothesis,
   finding that the percent of black students in a school is related to
   increased odds of suspension/expulsion, and differential effects of
   behavior partially mediate these relationships. However, I also find
   that a traditional threat narrative may be insufficient. Black students
   may be most likely to experience unequal sanctions on their behavior in
   racially homogeneous contexts-whether homogeneously black or white.
   These results suggest that more research is needed to understand how the
   social organization of schools contributes to discipline inequality.

AB We study the process by which employers evaluate and interpret
   information related to the educational background of job applicants in
   simulated hiring contexts. We focus on England and the Netherlands,
   countries with very different education systems and labor-market
   institutions. Using a vignette study, a quasi-experimental technique, we
   asked employers to rate a series of resumes of hypothetical job
   applicants that randomly varied on a number of characteristics,
   including level of education, field of study, grades, study delays, and
   internships. Our findings suggest that the informational value of these
   characteristics varies across the two countries: English employers
   primarily sort applicants based on relative signals of merit such as
   grades, in line with queuing theory; Dutch employers instead base their
   ratings on fields of study and occupation-specific degrees, as predicted
   by human capital and closure theories. The findings from the vignette
   study are in line with results obtained from a survey administered to
   the same employers, corroborating the research validity. This study
   brings the employers' perspective into a field that has mainly tested
   theoretical arguments about employers' hiring behavior using employee
   data. From a theoretical point of view, our approach nuances three
   well-known theories on the relationship between education and job
   assignment (human capital, queuing, and closure theories), by specifying
   the scope conditions under which they are more likely to hold. We show
   that the reason why education matters to employers and the way employers
   evaluate educational credentials during the hiring process are
   conditional on institutions.

AB Prior research has documented a strong and positive correlation between
   completed education and adults' mental health. Researchers often
   describe this relationship using causal language: higher levels of
   education are thought to enhance people's skills, afford important
   structural advantages, and empower better coping mechanisms, all of
   which lead to better mental health. An alternative explanation-the
   social selection hypothesis-suggests that schooling is a proxy for
   unobserved endowments and/or preexisting conditions that confound the
   relationship between the two variables. In this article, we seek to
   adjudicate between these hypotheses using a relatively large, US-based
   sample of identical adult twins. By relating within-twin-pair
   differences in education to within-twin-pair differences in mental
   health, we are able to control for the influence of genetic traits and
   shared family characteristics that may otherwise bias the estimates
   associated with educational attainment. Results from our analyses
   suggest that the observed association between education and mental
   health is attributable to confounding on unobserved variables. This
   finding holds across mental health conditions, is robust to several
   sensitivity checks, and survives a falsification test. Theoretical
   implications for the study of educational gradients in mental health are
   discussed.

AB Romantic partnership is often considered an optimal barometer of
   intergroup relations. To date, however, it has been challenging to
   distinguish the characteristics people prefer in a partner from the
   types of partners that are locally available. Online dating presents a
   new opportunity to address this puzzle. In this paper, I use behavioral
   data from a popular online dating site to answer three questions
   regarding preferences in the early stages of mate choice: First, to what
   extent do people prefer similarity versus status in a partner-and do
   these preferences vary by gender? Second, what is the relative
   importance of different types of preferences-and to what extent are
   apparent preferences for one characteristic merely a "by-product" of
   preferences for another characteristic with which the first is
   correlated? Third, do preferences vary at different moments of
   selection-and if so, how? These analyses not only provide a nuanced
   portrait of how interpersonal dynamics shape broader social
   structures-here, a network of romantic ties-but they recommend a future
   approach to mate choice that prioritizes processes over outcomes and
   more deeply engages the literature on gender, social networks, and
   symbolic boundaries.

AB Political scientists increasingly recognize that multiple imputation
   represents a superior strategy for analyzing missing data to the widely
   used method of listwise deletion. However, there has been little
   systematic investigation of how multiple imputation affects existing
   empirical knowledge in the discipline. This article presents the first
   large-scale examination of the empirical effects of substituting
   multiple imputation for listwise deletion in political science. The
   examination focuses on research in the major subfield of comparative and
   international political economy (CIPE) as an illustrative example.
   Specifically, I use multiple imputation to reanalyze the results of
   almost every quantitative CIPE study published during a recent five-year
   period in International Organization and World Politics, two of the
   leading subfield journals in CIPE. The outcome is striking: in almost
   half of the studies, key results "disappear" (by conventional
   statistical standards) when reanalyzed.

AB We present new methods to estimate causal effects retrospectively from
   micro data with the assistance of a machine learning ensemble. This
   approach overcomes two important limitations in conventional methods
   like regression modeling or matching: (i) ambiguity about the pertinent
   retrospective counterfactuals and (ii) potential misspecification,
   overfitting, and otherwise bias-prone or inefficient use of a large
   identifying covariate set in the estimation of causal effects. Our
   method targets the analysis toward a well-defined "retrospective
   intervention effect" based on hypothetical population interventions and
   applies a machine learning ensemble that allows data to guide us, in a
   controlled fashion, on how to use a large identifying covariate set. We
   illustrate with an analysis of policy options for reducing ex-combatant
   recidivism in Colombia.

   just individual transitions between phases, but also the duration that
   subjects spend within phases, as well as the effect of covariates on
   subjects' trajectories through the process's multiple phases. We
   introduce the multistate survival model to political scientists, which
   is capable of modeling precisely this type of situation. The model is
   appealing because of its ability to accommodate multiple forms of causal
   complexity that unfold over time. In particular, we highlight three
   attractive features of multistate models: transition-specific baseline
   hazards, transition-specific covariate effects, and the ability to
   estimate transition probabilities. We provide two applications to
   illustrate these features.

AB The analysis of necessary conditions for some outcome of interest has
   long been one of the main preoccupations of scholars in all disciplines
   of the social sciences. In this connection, the introduction of
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in the late 1980s has
   revolutionized the way research on necessary conditions has been carried
   out. Standards of good practice for QCA have long demanded that the
   results of preceding tests for necessity constrain QCA's core process of
   Boolean minimization so as to enhance the quality of parsimonious and
   intermediate solutions. Schneider and Wagemann's Theory-Guided/Enhanced
   Standard Analysis (T/ESA) is currently being adopted by applied
   researchers as the new state-of-the-art procedure in this respect. In
   drawing on Schneider and Wagemann's own illustrative data example and a
   meta-analysis of thirty-six truth tables across twenty-one published
   studies that have adhered to current standards of good practice in QCA,
   I demonstrate that, once bias against compound conditions in necessity
   tests is accounted for, T/ESA will produce conservative solutions, and
   not enhanced parsimonious or intermediate ones.

AB The appropriateness of experiments for studying causal mechanisms is
   well established. However, the ability of an experiment to isolate the
   effect of emotion has received less attention, and in this letter we lay
   out a guide to manipulating and tracing the impact of emotions. Some
   experimental manipulations are straightforward. Manipulating an emotion
   like anxiety is less obvious. There is no magic "political anxiety pill"
   and placebo that can be randomly assigned to participants. While the
   magic political anxiety pill is still elusive, we advocate using
   multiple manipulations, extensive pretesting, and mediation models.
   These approaches have allowed us to situate a discrete emotional
   experience in a complex political environment.

AB We propose a summary statistic for the economic well-being of people in
   a country. Our measure incorporates consumption, leisure, mortality, and
   inequality, first for a narrow set of countries using detailed micro
   data, and then more broadly using multi-country datasets. While welfare
   is highly correlated with GDP per capita, deviations are often large.
   Western Europe looks considerably closer to the United States, emerging
   Asia has not caught up as much, and many developing countries are
   further behind. Each component we introduce plays a significant role in
   accounting for these differences, with mortality being most important.

AB Political scientists frequently wish to test hypotheses about the
   effects of specific emotions on political behavior. However, commonly
   used experimental manipulations tend to have collateral effects on
   emotions other than the targeted emotion, making it difficult to ascribe
   outcomes to any single emotion. In this letter, we propose to address
   this problem using causal mediation analysis. We illustrate this
   approach using an experiment examining the effect of emotion on dyadic
   trust, as measured by the trust game. Our findings suggest that negative
   emotions can decrease trust, but only if those negative emotions make
   people feel less certain about their current situation. Our results
   suggest that only anxiety, a low-certainty emotion, has a negative
   impact on trust, whereas anger and guilt, two emotions that differ in
   their control appraisals but induce the same high level of certainty,
   appear to have no effect on trusting behavior. Importantly, we find that
   failing to use causal mediation analysis would ascribe a positive effect
   of anxiety on trust, demonstrating the value of this approach.

AB The farm household model has played a central role in improving the
   understanding of small-scale agricultural households and non-farm
   enterprises. Under the assumptions that all current and future markets
   exist and that farmers treat all prices as given, the model simplifies
   households' simultaneous production and consumption decisions into a
   recursive form in which production can be treated as independent of
   preferences of household members. These assumptions, which are the
   foundation of a large literature in labor and development, have been
   tested and not rejected in several important studies including Benjamin
   (1992). Using multiple waves of longitudinal survey data from Central
   Java, Indonesia, this paper tests a key prediction of the recursive
   model: demand for farm labor is unrelated to the demographic composition
   of the farm household. The prediction is unambiguously rejected. The
   rejection cannot be explained by contamination due to unobserved
   heterogeneity that is fixed at the farm level, local area shocks, or
   farm-specific shocks that affect changes in household composition and
   farm labor demand. We conclude that the recursive form of the farm
   household model is not consistent with the data. Developing empirically
   tractable models of farm households when markets are incomplete remains
   an important challenge.

AB Assimilation research largely assumes that Southern, Central, and
   Eastern European immigrants achieved assimilation due to job ladders
   within manufacturing firms in the first half of the 20th century. But
   this literature has never tested whether Italians and Slavs experienced
   upward mobility. Did manufacturing allow for the upward advancement of
   all European-origin groups? Using data sets containing employment
   histories from 1900 to 1950 in three manufacturing companies-A. M. Byers
   Company, Pullman-Standard Manufacturing, and the Ford Motor Company-this
   article offers the first empirical analysis of occupational mobility
   within factories among European-origin groups. Results suggest that
   organizational structures within firms through the formation of internal
   labor markets did little to counter other forces that kept immigrants
   from achieving upward mobility. Southern, Central, and Eastern European
   immigrants ended their careers within firms where they began-positions
   at the bottom of the occupational hierarchy-contrary to the implicit
   assumptions of assimilation research.

AB What factors best explain the U.S. growth in economic stratification
   since the late 1970s? This research tests the power resource hypothesis
   with a pooled time-series analysis of income inequality. In a departure
   from prior research, the explanatory power of both national-and
   state-level political accounts is evaluated. By analyzing tax
   statistics, the authors isolate the factors that produce the largest gap
   in U.S. income distributions. Findings indicate that increases in the
   political strength of neoliberal national administrations and
   skill-biased technical change (SBTC) are the most influential
   determinants-although the SBTC account became much less influential
   after the 1980s. Other accounts have considerable explanatory power, as
   the results show that inequality grew after decreases in manufacturing
   and expansions in minority populations. But these findings show that
   national-level neoliberal political determinants best explain the
   extraordinary increase in U.S. income inequality.

AB This article presents a dynamic view of how institutions external to the
   state foster informal relationships that influence the voting
   preferences of elected officials. Institutions external to the state can
   activate different identities, potentially leading to outcomes at odds
   with predictions based on party identification and political ideology.
   This theoretical perspective is applied to a period of increasing
   partisanship and polarization-the birth of the second party system in
   America-when congressmen lived together in boardinghouses chosen
   independently of preexisting political preferences. Common residency is
   found to mute the effect of partisanship while reinforcing the
   North-South divide; this effect was strongest during the period of most
   acute polarization. This finding sheds light on the interaction between
   state and nonstate institutions and their differential impact on the
   political process. It also suggests a cause of current high levels of
   political polarization: the lack of time congressmen spend together
   informally.

AB Conventional analyses of social mobility and status reproduction
   retrospectively compare an outcome of individuals to a characteristic of
   their parents. By ignoring the mechanisms of family formation and
   excluding childless individuals, conventional approaches introduce
   selection bias into estimates of how characteristics in one generation
   affect an outcome in the next. The prospective approach introduced here
   integrates the effects of college on marriage and fertility into the
   reproduction of educational outcomes. Marginal structural models with
   inverse probability of treatment weighting are used with data from the
   Wisconsin Longitudinal Study to estimate the causal effect of pathways
   linking graduating from college with having a child who graduates from
   college. Results show that college increases male graduates' probability
   of having a child who completes college; for female graduates there is
   no effect. The gender distinction is largely explained by the negative
   effects of college on women's likelihood to marry and have children.

AB Why is there so much occupational sex segregation in the 21st century?
   The authors cast light on this question by using the O*NET archive of
   occupation traits to operationalize the concepts of essentialism and
   vertical inequality more exhaustively than in past research. When the
   new model is applied to recent U.S. Census data, the results show that
   much vertical segregation remains even after the physical, analytic, and
   interactional forms of essentialism are controlled; that essentialism
   nonetheless accounts for much more of total segregation than does
   vertical inequality; that the physical and interactional forms of
   segregation are especially strong; that the physical form of
   essentialism is one of the few examples of female-advantaging
   segregation; and that essentialism takes on a fractal structure that
   generates much finely detailed segregation at detailed occupational
   levels. The authors conclude by discussing how essentialist processes
   partly account for the intransigence of occupational sex segregation.

AB Racial profiling and the disproportionate use of police force are
   controversial political issues. I argue that racial bias in the use of
   force increases after relevant events such as the shooting of a police
   officer by a black suspect. To examine this argument, I design a quasi
   experiment using data from 3.9 million time and geocoded pedestrian
   stops in New York City. The findings show that two fatal shootings of
   police officers by black suspects increased the use of police force
   against blacks substantially in the days after the shootings. The use of
   force against whites and Hispanics, however, remained unchanged, and
   there is no evidence for an effect of two other police murders by a
   white and Hispanic suspect. Aside from the importance for the debate on
   racial profiling and police use of force, this research reveals a
   general set of processes where events create intergroup conflict,
   foreground stereotypes, and trigger discriminatory responses.

AB We propose a theory of monetary policy and macroprudential interventions
   in financial markets. We focus on economies with nominal rigidities in
   goods and labor markets and subject to constraints on monetary policy,
   such as the zero lower bound or fixed exchange rates. We identify an
   aggregate demand externality that can be corrected by macroprudential
   interventions in financial markets. Ex post, the distribution of wealth
   across agents affects aggregate demand and output. Ex ante, however,
   these effects are not internalized in private financial decisions. We
   provide a simple formula for the required financial interventions that
   depends on a small number of measurable sufficient statistics. We also
   characterize optimal monetary policy. We extend our framework to
   incorporate pecuniary externalities, providing a unified approach to
   both externalities. Finally, we provide a number of applications which
   illustrate the relevance of our theory.

AB I estimate a search-and-bargaining model of a decentralized market to

   prices, and welfare, and to quantify the effects of intermediaries that
   facilitate trade. Using business-aircraft data, I find that, relative to
   the Walrasian benchmark, 18.3 percent of the assets are misallocated;
   prices are 19.2 percent lower; and the aggregate welfare losses equal
   23.9 percent. Dealers play an important role in reducing trading
   frictions: In a market with no dealers, a larger fraction of assets
   would be misallocated, and prices would be higher. However, dealers
   reduce aggregate welfare because their operations are costly, and they
   impose a negative externality by decreasing the number of agents' direct
   transactions.

   Fishburn's function returns so-called maximal lotteries, that is,
   lotteries that correspond to optimal mixed strategies in the symmetric

   (risk love). The rationalizable set reaches an upper bound under extreme
   risk aversion, and lower bound under risk love, and both of these bounds

AB IO economists often estimate demand for differentiated products using
   data sets with a small number of large markets. This paper addresses the
   question of consistency and asymptotic distributions of instrumental
   variables estimates as the number of products increases in some commonly
   used models of demand under conditions on economic primitives. I show
   that, in a Bertrand-Nash equilibrium, product characteristics lose their
   identifying power as price instruments in the limit in certain cases,
   leading to inconsistent estimates. The reason is that product
   characteristic instruments achieve identification through correlation
   with markups, and, depending on the model of demand, the supply side can
   constrain markups to converge to a constant quickly relative to sampling
   error. I find that product characteristic instruments can yield
   consistent estimates in many of the cases I consider, but care must be
   taken in modeling demand and choosing instruments. A Monte Carlo study
   confirms that the asymptotic results are relevant in market sizes of
   practical importance.

   employment. Tax credits are welfare improving in the U.K., increase

AB Does the lack of wealth constrain parents' investments in the human
   capital of their descendants? We conduct a nearly 50-year follow-up of
   an episode in which such constraints would have been plausibly relaxed
   by a random allocation of substantial wealth to families. We track
   descendants of participants in Georgia's Cherokee Land Lottery of 1832,
   in which nearly every adult white male in the state took part. Winners
   received close to the median level of wealth-a large financial windfall
   orthogonal to participants' underlying characteristics that might have
   also affected their children's human capital. Although winners had
   slightly more children than did nonwinners, they did not send them to
   school more. Sons of winners have no better adult outcomes (wealth,
   income, literacy) than the sons of nonwinners, and winners'
   grandchildren do not have higher literacy or school attendance than
   nonwinners' grandchildren. We can reject effects implied by the
   cross-sectional gradient of child outcomes by paternal wealth. This
   suggests only a limited role for family financial resources in the
   formation of human capital in the next generations in this environment
   and a potentially more important role for other factors that persist
   through family lines.

AB Tensions between the demands of the knowledge-based economy and
   remaining, blue-collar jobs underlie renewed debates about whether
   schools should emphasize career and technical training or
   college-preparatory curricula. We add a gendered lens to this issue,
   given the male-dominated nature of blue-collar jobs and women's greater
   returns to college. Using the ELS:2002, this study exploits spatial
   variation in school curricula and jobs to investigate local dynamics
   that shape gender stratification. Results suggest a link between high
   school training and jobs in blue-collar communities that structures
   patterns of gender inequality into early adulthood. Although high school
   training in blue-collar communities reduced both men's and women's odds
   of four-year college enrollment, it had gender-divergent labor market
   consequences. Men in blue-collar communities took more blue-collar
   courses, had higher rates of blue-collar employment, and earned similar
   wages relative to otherwise comparable men from non-blue-collar
   communities. Women were less likely to work and to be employed in
   professional occupations, and they suffered severe wage penalties
   relative to their male peers and women from non-blue-collar communities.
   These relationships were due partly to high schools in blue-collar
   communities offering more blue-collar and fewer advanced
   college-preparatory courses. This curricular tradeoff may benefit men,
   but it appears to disadvantage women.

AB International development scholars routinely test for convergence across
   a range of outcomes, including income, health, and education. However,
   the extent to which countries have reordered themselves along the
   development hierarchy receives less attention. Accordingly, the present
   analysis features a systematic examination of cross-national mobility in
   international development. I first introduce a generic model of mobility
   in which country-level movement is a function of several factors,
   including initial inequality, growth dynamics, and temporal span. I then
   show that observed mobility rates across several development indicators
   (gross domestic product per capita [GDP PC], human development index
   [HDI], and life expectancy) are significantly lower than what the
   generic model predicts. An investigation of longitudinal trends shows
   that mobility rates have been declining since the 1980s and that the
   discrepancy between expected and observed mobility has grown wider
   during this time. Mobility rates appear to be hindered by the lack of
   large-scale mobility among upper tier countries (where mobility patterns
   are more favorable than expected) and lower tier countries (where
   mobility patterns are less favorable than expected). Overall, the
   results are consistent with propositions derived from world-system
   theory regarding the relative stability of the core/periphery hierarchy.
   In sum, the analysis of mobility can serve as a useful complement to
   existing research and produces an image of development and change not
   typically found in convergence studies.

AB Flouting 150 years of reports on their political impotence, millions of

   provoked this unexpected development? This article analyzes the
   Colombian informal recycler movement-a "least likely" case for
   successful mobilization due to the recyclers' extreme marginality and
   the Colombian state's violent repression of labor movements. The article
   argues that the rise of neoliberalism and the consolidation of democracy
   created political opportunities that conventional perspectives on the
   informal economy would not lead us to expect. Three specific links
   connected these macro-level transformations to increases in the
   recyclers' collective organizing capacity. First, technical, financial,
   and symbolic backing from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) enabled
   recyclers to develop innovative organizing models. Second, new human
   rights provisions contained in the Constitution of 1991 created an
   opening to challenge state policy. Third, the privatization of waste
   management spurred recyclers to action by leaving them with two
   clear-cut possibilities: waste corporations might permanently displace
   them, or recyclers might collectively organize to protect and improve
   their livelihoods.

AB Literature on global care work deals with biopolitical tensions between
   care markets and exclusionary migration regimes leading to the formation
   of transnational families. Nevertheless, it disregards how these
   tensions produce "illegal" families within countries of destination,
   catalyzing the mobilization of moral claims over their recognition in
   the local civil society. To fill this lacuna, this article looks at the
   interface between migration policies controlling the reproductive lives
   of migrant care workers and the mobilization of ethical claims and moral
   constructions of care from below (i.e., movements and organizations
   advocating for care workers). Based on fieldwork in Israeli advocacy
   NGOs and the 2009 anti-deportation campaign, we suggest that the
   sociolegal position of migrant care workers' families in destination
   countries is shaped not only by state policies and market dynamics but
   also by the types of social mobilizations, ethical evaluations, and
   pragmatic strategizing they spur in civil society. Findings show that
   while anti-deportation networks and NGO's advocacy succeeded in
   achieving public recognition of the reproductive needs and lives of care
   workers, their forms of moral reasoning and strategizing reinforced
   definitions of care workers as primarily workers and of their children
   as humanitarian exceptions to the non-immigration regime. We conclude by
   arguing that the transformative power of the politics of ethical claims
   from below in stringent ethnonational regimes like the Israeli may be
   contingent on its not disrupting the tensions between wanted workers and
   unwanted families but rendering them manageable. As such, civil
   society's social and moral agency broadens the range of actors and
   dynamics shaping the globalization of care as well as its
   contradictions.

   unlicensed street vendors-and show that responses to the campaign varied
   along group lines. Unlicensed peddlers either abandoned the field or
   drew on local networks to continue peddling under harsher conditions,
   whereas licensed street vendors relied on well-established ties to
   actors in the political field. After these ties proved ineffective,
   licensed street vendors survived thanks to the intervention of a
   non-governmental organization (NGO) that activated the judicial field
   and mobilized the legal capital vested in the licenses. The linkage role
   performed by this actor with cross-field networks and expertise shows
   the strategic import of interfield relations, which replicate and

   uses census categories. In this article, however, I question whether
   census categories (in Brazil) are the most adequate measure for
   estimating ethnoracial inequality. Using the first nationally
   representative survey to include interviewer-rated skin color data in
   Brazil (LAPOP 2010), I examine: (1) the association between skin color
   and stratification outcomes, (2) how using multiple measures of race may
   reveal different information about inequality across different outcomes,
   and (3) whether census race categories and skin color should be
   considered equivalent or analytically distinct concepts. I find that
   skin color is a stronger predictor of educational attainment and
   occupational status among Brazilians than race (operationalized as
   census race-color categories used in virtually all research on
   ethnoracial inequality in Brazil). Centrally, this study finds that
   "race" and "color" are analytically distinct concepts given that they
   are empirically distinct, even though they are often conflated in
   everyday life and by social scientists. The implications of these
   findings for the study of ethnoracial inequality in Brazil and beyond
   are discussed, with a focus on directions for future research.

AB The dynamics of contaminated communities have become an increasingly
   important area of research with the rise of environmental hazards
   worldwide. While much is known about communities that unite to protest
   toxic conditions, places where such mobilization has not occurred are
   far less frequently studied. Drawing on five months of ethnographic
   research, this article examines one such community (La Oroya) in Peru
   that is plagued by dangerously high lead levels, a product of 90 years
   of heavy metal smelter activity. What little mobilization has occurred
   in La Oroya arose not to protest contamination, but rather to contest
   the potential closure of the metallurgical complex. Through an analysis
   of the discursive frames that residents use to make sense of
   contamination, this article highlights the significance of community,
   collective self-understandings, and moral boundary making in community
   responses to toxic conditions. These aforementioned dimensions-not
   merely the presence of industry or potential job loss-shape subjective
   perceptions of risk in La Oroya in ways that tend to suppress the
   emergence of sustained collective action.

AB The stigma associated with gender-based violence (GBV) exacerbates its
   physical and mental health impacts, as well as the chances of
   experiencing additional violence. We extend understanding of this stigma
   and its effects by demonstrating how stigma operates as a mechanism of
   social control at both interactional and structural levels to preserve
   the moral order. We also further general stigma theory by clarifying the
   conceptualization of power that befits understanding stigma as a
   mechanism of social control that has cognitive, interpersonal,
   structural, and moral components. Analysis of data from 6 focus groups
   with women survivors of intimate partner violence and 19 interviews with
   close others and key informants in Kenya shows that the moral order, or
   what matters most, is maintenance of the marital unit, to a great degree
   because it is the institution that maintains the economic survival of
   women and children. The cultural belief that a woman experiencing
   spousal abuse has violated normative gender and spousal expectations and
   is therefore a threat to the moral order of the community demands that
   both husbands and community members act to protect the moral order.
   Protection of the moral order is accomplished through discrimination
   against survivors that is institutionalized through custom, law, and the
   family. Thus stigma acts as a, albeit contested, community process of
   social control that (re) produces gendered power geographies.

AB Early empirical research on ethical consumerism-the deliberate purchase,
   or avoidance, of products for political, ethical, or environmental
   reasons-was primarily individualistic in nature. Recently, scholars have
   demonstrated the importance of structural and cultural contexts to the
   explanation of ethical consumerism, rendering explanations that fail to
   account for such contexts incomplete. Unfortunately, most of this
   research has been contained within Europe, limiting potentially
   important country-level variation. Because theories of ethical
   consumerism suggest interactive relationships between individual-and
   macro-level variables, the Euro-centric nature of existing research
   raises questions about theoretical generalizability across all levels of
   analysis. This study uses the 2004 citizenship module of the
   International Social Survey Program (ISSP)-a data set that allows for
   increased country-level heterogeneity while maintaining the highest
   standards of data quality-to run a series of multilevel, logistic
   regression models with cross-level interactions between country-level
   affluence and individual-level predictors. Seven of the eight
   individual-level predictors analyzed in these interactions are either
   more influential in high-affluence countries than in low-affluence
   countries or exhibit statistically uniform effects across the range of
   affluence. The lone exception is association involvement, which is more
   influential as affluence decreases. The need to develop interactive
   models of political participation is discussed.

AB This study analyses the effect of employment protection legislation
   (EPL) on youth unemployment and employment rates in Western Europe. It
   differentiates between two components of EPL: job security provisions
   and regulations on temporary contracts. While deregulating job security
   provisions is expected to lower youth unemployment, the impact of
   deregulating temporary contracts is ambiguous, but should depend on the
   strictness of job security provisions. A literature review and
   replication of prior research demonstrate that much prior evidence
   linking EPL to higher youth unemployment is not robust to important or
   minor specification checks. The empirical analysis uses aggregate data
   from 16 Western European countries and the United States for the period
   from 1980 to 2008 (N = 461) and fixed effects and
   differences-in-differences estimation. While effects of job security
   provisions are inconsistent across specifications, there is suggestive
   evidence that deregulating temporary contracts at high levels of job
   security provisions has significantly increased youth unemployment rates
   and lowered youth employment rates.

AB Rigid employment protection legislation (EPL) has been blamed as the
   root of youths' labour market integration problems in Europe. Many
   European countries have reacted by deregulating employment protection
   laws, often targeting youths as a group. However, doubts about the
   effectiveness of EPL reforms have arisen. Against this background, this
   article investigates whether EPL reforms succeeded in integrating youths
   into labour markets or whether they were ineffective and just promoted
   temporary employment as a crucial new social inequality in Europe. Based
   on two-step, three-level analyses using micro-data from the European
   Labour Force Survey for 19 European countries for the period from 1992
   to 2012, our results show that deregulating the use of temporary
   contracts increased temporary employment risks of youths but did not
   reduce (for low-educated young men, even increased) unemployment risks.
   In contrast, we find some evidence that decreasing the protection of
   permanent jobs was successful in decreasing risks of
   inequality/insecurity (in terms of temporary jobs) without affecting the
   risks of labour market exclusion.

AB This article aims to explain the observation that patterns in
   inequalities in the risk of temporary employment differ between
   institutional environments. Following up on previous research, it is
   proposed that the transaction costs associated with different job
   contents influence employers' decisions with regard to which employees
   to hire on a temporary contract, which is again conditional on the
   institutional environments. Using multilevel logistic regression to
   estimate cross-level interactions between the protection of permanent
   employment (EPLp) and temporary employment (EPLt) and skill and job
   variables from the European Social Survey, it is shown that the relative
   deregulation of temporary employment increases the strength of skill
   specificity and educational attainment as drivers of inequalities in
   type of contract. Additionally, analyses of the predicted probabilities
   of temporary employment for employees with different levels of skill
   specificity in varying EPLp/EPLt regimes show these effects to be
   non-trivial. These results argue in favour of using theories from an
   economic sociology when studying employer behaviour, and urge
   policymakers to mind the balance in EPLp and EPLt when aiming to
   facilitate labour market adjustment.

AB This article deals with the relation between labour market regulation
   and the dynamics of overall employment and unemployment in continental
   Europe. We investigate the impact of the reforms of employment
   protection systems and activating welfare policies and test the
   integrative power of marginal labour market deregulation, assessing
   occupational outcomes of changing workforce exposure to unemployment and
   fixed-term contracts. Thus, particular attention is paid to the possible
   effect of 'institutionally driven' labour market segmentation, mirrored
   by the national discrepancy in employment protections of workers with
   distinct contractual arrangements and by the ratio of expenses on GDP in
   active versus passive labour market policies. We use pseudo-panel data
   based on European Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) (1992-2008) and apply
   linear fixed effect (FE) models with lagged independent variables. The
   deregulation measure-the insider-outsider differentials-is based on the
   OECD employment protection legislation index (EPL 2013). The overall
   findings indicate a detrimental effect of unbalanced passive and active
   labour market policies, a negative trend of permanent employment, and a
   'honeymoon effect' of partial and targeted deregulation measures whose
   effectiveness on overall employment, if any, appears to be progressively
   weakened over time. The responsiveness of employment conditions to
   marginal EPL variations as well as to previous 'unstable employment
   situations' is significantly higher in Southern Europe. Temporary
   employment, if compared with unemployment, may still play a role in
   reducing individual subsequent unemployment risks, but its 'integrative
   effect' is hardly confirmed if we view fixed-term contracts as a
   stepping stone towards stable insertion into the primary labour market.

AB We develop and structurally estimate a model of heterogeneous
   multiproduct firms that can be used to decompose the firm-size
   distribution into the contributions of costs, "appeal" (quality or
   taste), markups, and product scope. Using Nielsen barcode data on prices
   and sales, we find that variation in firm appeal and product scope
   explains at least four fifths of the variation in firm sales. We show
   that the imperfect substitutability of products within firms, and the
   fact that larger firms supply more products than smaller firms, implies
   that standard productivity measures are highly dependent on implicit
   demand system assumptions and probably dramatically understate the
   relative productivity of the largest firms. Although most firms are well
   approximated by the monopolistic competition benchmark of constant
   markups, we find that the largest firms that account for most of
   aggregate sales depart substantially from this benchmark, and exhibit
   both variable markups and substantial cannibalization effects.

AB The financial crisis of 2007 to 2009 was marked by widespread fraud in
   the mortgage securitization industry. Most of the largest mortgage
   originators and mortgage-backed securities issuers and underwriters have
   been implicated in regulatory settlements, and many have paid
   multibillion-dollar penalties. This article seeks to explain why this
   behavior became so pervasive. We evaluate predominant theories of
   white-collar crime, finding that theories emphasizing deregulation or
   technical opacity identify only necessary, not sufficient, conditions.
   Our argument focuses instead on changes in competitive conditions and
   firms' positions within and across markets. As the supply of mortgages
   began to decline around 2003, mortgage originators lowered credit
   standards and engaged in predatory lending to shore up profits. In turn,
   vertically integrated mortgage-backed securities issuers and
   underwriters committed securities fraud to conceal this malfeasance and
   enhance the value of other financial products. Our results challenge
   several existing accounts of how widespread the fraud should have been
   and, given the systemic crimes that occurred, which financial
   institutions were the most likely to commit fraud. We consider the
   implications of our results for regulations that were based on some of
   these models. We also discuss the overlooked importance of illegal
   behavior for the sociology of markets.

AB Bureaucratic and patrimonial theories of organized crime tend to miss
   the history and mobility of crime groups integrating into and organizing
   with legitimate society. The network property of multiplexitywhen more
   than one type of relationship exists between a pair of actorsoffers a
   theoretical and empirical inroad to analyzing overlapping relationships
   of seemingly disparate social spheres. Using the historical case of
   organized crime in Chicago and a unique relational database coded from
   more than 5,000 pages of archival documents, we map the web of multiplex
   relationships among bootleggers, politicians, union members,
   businessmen, families, and friends. We analyze the overlap of criminal,
   personal, and legitimate networks containing 1,030 individuals and 3,726
   mutual dyads between them. Multiplexity is rare in these data: only 10
   percent of the mutual dyads contain multiplex ties. However, results
   from bivariate exponential random graph models demonstrate that
   multiplexity is a relevant structural property binding the three
   networks together. Even among our sample of criminals, we find
   dependencies between the criminal and personal networks and the criminal
   and legitimate networks. Although not pervasive, multiplexity glued
   these worlds of organized crime together above and beyond the
   personalities of famous gangsters, ethnic homophily, and other
   endogenous network processes.

AB This article demonstrates how class origin shapes earnings in higher
   professional and managerial employment. Taking advantage of newly
   released data in Britain's Labour Force Survey, we examine the relative
   openness of different high-status occupations and the earnings of the
   upwardly mobile within them. In terms of access, we find a distinction
   between traditional professions, such as law, medicine, and finance,
   which are dominated by the children of higher managers and
   professionals, and more technical occupations, such as engineering and
   IT, that recruit more widely. Moreover, even when people who are from
   working-class backgrounds are successful in entering high-status
   occupations, they earn 17 percent less, on average, than individuals
   from privileged backgrounds. This class-origin pay gap translates to up
   to 7,350 pound ($11,000) lower annual earnings. This difference is
   partly explained by the upwardly mobile being employed in smaller firms
   and working outside London, but it remains substantial even net of a
   variety of important predictors of earnings. These findings underline
   the value of investigating differences in mobility rates between
   individual occupations as well as illustrating how, beyond entry, the
   mobile population often faces an earnings class ceiling within
   high-status occupations.

AB Despite a large literature investigating how spouses' earnings and
   division of labor relate to their risk of divorce, findings remain mixed
   and conclusions elusive. Core unresolved questions are (1) whether
   marital stability is primarily associated with the economic gains to
   marriage or with the gendered lens through which spouses' earnings and
   employment are interpreted and (2) whether the determinants of marital
   stability have changed over time. Using data from the 1968 to 2013 waves
   of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I consider how spouses' division
   of labor, their overall financial resources, and a wife's ability to
   support herself in the event of divorce are associated with the risk of
   divorce, and how these associations have changed between couples married
   before and after 1975. Financial considerationswives' economic
   independence and total household incomeare not predictive of divorce in
   either cohort. Time use, however, is associated with divorce risk in
   both cohorts. For marriages formed after 1975, husbands' lack of
   full-time employment is associated with higher risk of divorce, but
   neither wives' full-time employment nor wives' share of household labor
   is associated with divorce risk. Expectations of wives' homemaking may
   have eroded, but the husband breadwinner norm persists.

AB Many aggregate-level studies suggest a relationship between economic
   inequality and sociodemographic outcomes such as family formation,
   health, and mortality; individual-level evidence, however, is lacking.
   Nor is there satisfactory evidence on the mechanisms by which inequality
   may have an effect. We study the determinants of transitions to a
   nonmarital first birth as a single parent or as a cohabiting parent
   compared to transitions to marriage prior to a first birth among
   unmarried, childless young adults in the National Longitudinal Survey of
   Youth, 1997 cohort, from 1997 to 2011. We include measures of
   county-group-level household income inequality and the availability of
   jobs typically held by high school graduates that pay above-poverty
   wages (i.e., middle-skilled jobs). We find that greater income
   inequality is associated with a reduced likelihood of transitioning to
   marriage prior to a first birth for both women and men. The association
   between levels of inequality and transitions to marriage can be
   partially accounted for by the availability of middle-skilled jobs. Some
   models also suggest that greater income inequality is associated with a
   reduced likelihood of transitioning to a first birth while cohabiting.

AB Contemporary debates on the relationship between migration and
   development focus extensively on how migrant remittances affect the
   economies of sending countries. Yet remittances also produce dynamic
   political consequences in migrants' origin communities. Income earned
   abroad creates political opportunities for migrant groups to participate
   in the provision of public services in their hometowns. Focusing on
   organizational variation in partnerships across time and space, this
   article examines the conditions under which the transnational
   coproduction of public goods between organized migrants and public
   agencies at origin shapes democratic governance. I argue that local
   citizen inclusion and government engagement interact to determine four
   different types of coproduction: corporatist, fragmented, substitutive,
   and synergetic. Using four comparative case studies based on fieldwork
   in three Mexican states, I trace central mechanisms to organizational
   forms of coproduction and describe how emergent variation affects
   democratic governance and state-society relations. I show how
   transnational forces, when collaborating with local social and political
   institutions, can profoundly affect democratic development.

AB To what extent do voluntary organizations like sports, leisure, and
   neighborhood associations provide a platform where ethnic groups mingle
   and ethnic boundaries are overcome? This study uses unique panel data
   from the Netherlands Longitudinal Life Course Study (NELLS) to shed
   light on the integrative power of voluntary associations. I investigate
   decisions to join and leave associations of different ethnic
   composition, as a member or a volunteer, among individuals of Turkish,
   Moroccan, and native Dutch origin. In general, all ethnic groups are
   equally likely to join voluntary organizations, but ethnic minorities
   are more likely to leave than are Dutch natives, even after accounting
   for relevant sociodemographic characteristics. This alone explains
   ethnic minorities' lower involvement rates. Moreover, joining decisions
   are characterized by strong ethnic sorting across organizations of
   different ethnic composition: people are much more likely to join
   associations containing fewer ethnic out-group members. This limits the
   potential of voluntary associations as pathways to social integration.
   In contrast, once the initial hurdle of getting involved has been taken,
   people are no more likely to disengage from organizations with more
   ethnic out-group members. Inter-ethnic neighborhood contact and the
   local supply of involvement opportunities are most influential in
   explaining the strong sorting tendencies in people's joining decisions.

AB Drawing on Bayesian probability theory, we propose a generalization of
   affect control theory (BayesACT) that better accounts for the dynamic
   fluctuation of identity meanings for self and other during interactions,
   elucidates how people infer and adjust meanings through social
   experience, and shows how stable patterns of interaction can emerge from
   individuals' uncertain perceptions of identities. Using simulations, we
   illustrate how this generalization offers a resolution to several issues
   of theoretical significance within sociology and social psychology by
   balancing cultural consensus with individual deviations from shared
   meanings, balancing meaning verification with the learning processes
   reflective of change, and accounting for noise in communicating
   identity. We also show how the model speaks to debates about core
   features of the self, which can be understood as stable and yet
   malleable, coherent and yet composed of multiple identities that may
   carry competing meanings. We discuss applications of the model in
   different areas of sociology, implications for understanding identity
   and social interaction, as well as the theoretical grounding of
   computational models of social behavior.

   develop a method to quantify the economic value of large-scale renewable

   for offset carbon dioxide, we find social costs of $138.40 per megawatt
   hour for 20 percent solar generation, of which unforecastable

   With solar installation costs of $1.52 per watt and carbon dioxide

AB This paper examines the macroeconomic implications of sovereign risk in
   a model in which banks hold domestic government debt. News of a future
   sovereign default hampers financial intermediation. First, it tightens
   the funding constraints of banks, reducing their resources to finance
   firms (liquidity channel). Second, it generates a precautionary motive
   to deleverage (risk channel). I estimate the model using Italian data,
   finding that sovereign risk was recessionary and that the risk channel
   was sizable. I also use the model to measure the effects of subsidized
   long-term loans to banks. Precautionary motives at the height of the

   randomly assigned whether it revealed to congressional offices that
   prospective attendees had contributed to campaigns. When informed

AB This article advances a political theory of regulation that accounts for
   the choices of regulators and regulated entities when both are

   regulate profit-maximizing firms: Governments set rules, to which firms
   respond rationally in ways that constrain their behavior. But often the
   entities that governments regulate are other governments. We argue that
   government agencies and private firms often face different compliance
   costs, and that agencies have greater incentives than firms to appeal
   regulations through political channels. Simultaneously, the typical
   enforcement instruments that regulators use to influence firm behavior
   may be less effective against governments. Our empirical subjects are
   public and private entities' compliance with the U.S. Clean Air Act and
   Safe Drinking Water Act. We find that, compared with private firms,
   governments violate these laws significantly more frequently and are
   less likely to be penalized for violations.

   increase de facto rights protection because they create organizations
   with the incentives and means to protect the underlying right, which
   renders these rights self-enforcing. Such organizations are not
   necessarily present to protect individual rights, which could make
   individual rights less effective. We test our theory using a variety of

   backlash impedes policy gains by marginalized groups. Public opinion
   research, however, suggests that widespread attitude change that
   backlash proponents theorize is likely to be rare. Examining backlash
   against gays and lesbians using a series of online and natural
   experiments about marriage equality, and large-sample survey data, we
   find no evidence of opinion backlash among the general public, by
   members of groups predisposed to dislike gays and lesbians, or from

   The important implication is that groups pursuing rights should not be

AB This article develops a theory of presidential unilateralism in which
   both ideological divergence with Congress and legislative capacity
   influence the president's use of executive orders. We argue that when
   Congress is less capable of constraining the executive, the president
   will issue more executive orders during periods of divided government.
   Conversely, in periods of high legislative capacity, the president is
   less likely to issue executive orders when faced with an opposed
   Congress. Based on an examination of institutional changes, we identify
   years prior to the mid-1940s as characterized by low congressional
   capacity and the subsequent period as characterized by high capacity.
   Testing the theory between 1905 and 2013, we find strong support for
   these predictions and demonstrate that legislative capacity conditions
   the role of ideological disagreement in shaping presidential action.

   fact: Electoral regimes vary substantially within countries, with some
   voters casting their ballot in semi-majoritarian districts of few

   within-country institutional variation, we contend, affects

   representation often leads to overrepresentation of voters supporting
   right-leaning parties. Utilizing district-level data from 20 Western

AB Many U.S. cities function without regular problems. They have well-kept
   roads, sewers that never overflow, and public parks with swing sets and
   restrooms. Others struggle to maintain balanced budgets, fail to
   adequately equip or staff their police forces, and offer little
   assistance to residents of limited means. What explains these
   differences? I argue that segregation along racial lines contributes to
   public goods inequalities. Racially segregated cities are also
   politically polarized cities, making collective investment more
   challenging and public goods expenditures lower. I provide evidence for
   this argument using election data from 25 large cities and demographic
   data matched to city finances in more than 2,600 places. To handle the
   problem of endogeneity, I instrument for segregation using the number of
   waterways in a city. I find that segregated municipalities are more
   politically polarized and spend less on a wide range of public goods.

AB Citizens unequally participate in referendums, and this may
   systematically bias policy in favor of those who vote. Some view
   compulsory voting as an important tool to alleviate this problem,
   whereas others worry about its detrimental effects on the legitimacy and
   quality of democratic decision making. So far, however, we lack
   systematic knowledge about the causal effect of compulsory voting on
   public policy. We argue that sanctioned compulsory voting mobilizes
   citizens at the bottom of the income distribution and that this
   translates into an increase in support for leftist policies. We
   empirically explore the effects of a sanctioned compulsory voting law on
   direct-democratic decision making in Switzerland. We find that
   compulsory voting significantly increases electoral support for leftist
   policy positions in referendums by up to 20 percentage points. We
   discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the
   policy consequences of electoral institutions.

AB Political parties competing in elections for the power to set public
   policy face the problem of making credible their policy promises to
   voters. I argue that this commitment problem crucially shapes party
   competition over redistribution. The model I develop shows that under
   majoritarian electoral rules, parties' efforts to achieve endogenous
   commitment to policies preferred by the middle class lead to different
   behavior and outcomes than suggested by existing theories, which either
   assume commitment or rule out endogenous commitment. Thus, left parties
   can have incentives to respond to rising income inequality by moving to
   the right in majoritarian systems but not under proportional
   representation. The model also generates new insights about the
   anti-left electoral bias often attributed to majoritarian electoral
   rules, and the strategic use of parliamentary candidates as a commitment
   device. I find evidence for key implications of this logic using panel
   data on party positions in 16 parliamentary democracies.

AB When studying sensitive issues, including corruption, prejudice, and
   sexual behavior, researchers have increasingly relied upon indirect
   questioning techniques to mitigate such known problems of direct survey
   questions as underreporting and nonresponse. However, there have been
   surprisingly few empirical validation studies of these indirect
   techniques because the information required to verify the resulting
   estimates is often difficult to access. This article reports findings
   from the first comprehensive validation study of indirect methods. We
   estimate whether people voted for an anti-abortion referendum held
   during the 2011 Mississippi General Election using direct questioning
   and three popular indirect methods: list experiment, endorsement
   experiment, and randomized response. We then validate these estimates
   against the official election outcome. While direct questioning leads to
   significant underestimation of sensitive votes against the referendum,
   indirect survey techniques yield estimates much closer to the actual
   vote count, with endorsement experiment and randomized response yielding
   the least bias.

AB World democracies widely differ in legislative, executive, and legal
   institutions. Different institutional environments induce different
   mappings from electoral outcomes to the distribution of power. We
   explore how these mappings affect voters' participation in an election.
   We show that the effect of such institutional differences on turnout
   depends on the distribution of voters' preferences. We uncover a novel
   contest effect: Given the preferences distribution, turnout increases
   and then decreases when we move from a more proportional to a less
   proportional power-sharing system; turnout is maximized for an
   intermediate degree of power sharing. Moreover, we generalize the
   competition effect, common to models of endogenous turnout: Given the
   institutional environment, turnout increases in the ex ante preferences
   evenness, and more so when the overall system has lower power sharing.
   These results are robust to a wide range of modeling approaches,
   including ethical voter models, voter mobilization models, and rational
   voter models.

AB As the recent Charlie Hebdo, Copenhagen cafe, and Garland, Texas,
   shootings show, religion has recently reemerged as a source of violence
   within liberal democracies, particularly in those instances where cases
   of alleged blasphemy are involved. Although toleration arose, within the
   liberal tradition, as a means of dealing with such conflict, some
   individuals, possessed of devout religious belief, when confronted with
   beliefs or practices profoundly at odds with their faith, cannot
   conceive of toleration as a possibility. In such situations, the demand
   that these individuals tolerate that to which their faith is at odds is
   likely to run up against a more personal and, for its adherents, eternal
   agenda. This article considers a way in which those with devout
   religious beliefs might tolerate that which is profoundly at odds with
   their faith, thereby providing a means to avoid violent outcomes such as
   those in the "extreme cases" above.

AB Scholars have long deplored voters' lack of interest in politics and
   argued in favor of greater political engagement. We present a formal
   theory of elections where successful communication of campaign messages
   requires both effort by candidates and attention from voters. Voters'
   interest in politics affects their attention and impacts the
   effectiveness of the electoral process as a screening and disciplining
   device. In line with existing theories, there exists a curse of the
   uninterested voter: When voters have little interest in politics, the
   electoral process performs poorly, and voters' attention to politics is
   low. Surprisingly, we uncover a curse of the interested voter, by which
   the same happens when voters have a strong interest in politics. Our
   results highlight the importance of distinguishing between voters'
   interest and attention, two notions often conflated in empirical
   studies. Moreover, policy interventions aimed at subsidizing the cost of
   acquiring political information can have unintended consequences.

AB Recent court decisions have encouraged new types of interest groups to
   become involved in election campaigns. Yet questions remain about
   whether interest group sponsorship of advertising affects the content of
   the issues being discussed. The ability of interest groups to influence
   the campaign agenda has implications for the extent to which politicians
   can be held accountable by citizens. In this research, we present a new
   conceptual framework for explaining variation in interest group
   advertising strategies and examine the factors leading different types
   of interest groups to be loose cannons (diverging from the issue debates
   among candidates) or loyal foot soldiers (matching the candidates' issue
   debates). We find more evidence of loyal foot soldier behavior among new
   multi-issue interest groups and among Republican groups and candidates.
   Fears of interest groups "hijacking" campaign agendas appear unfounded.

AB Regular church attendance is strongly associated with a higher
   probability of voting. It is an open question as to whether this
   association, which has been confirmed in numerous surveys, is causal.
   The repeal of the laws restricting Sunday retail activity ('blue laws')
   is used to measure the effects of church-going on political
   participation. Blue laws' repeal caused a 5 percent decrease in church
   attendance. Its effect on political participation was measured and it
   was found that, following the repeal, turnout fell by approximately 1
   percentage point. This decline in turnout is consistent with the large
   effect of church attendance on turnout reported in the literature, and
   suggests that church attendance may have a significant causal effect on
   voter turnout.

AB This article explores the link between industrial policy and electoral
   outcomes under dictatorship. Using a difference-in-differences analysis
   of county-level panel data from 1971-88 in South Korea, it examines
   whether the industrial policy implemented by an authoritarian government
   affects constituents' electoral decisions. It finds that counties
   receiving economic benefits through the construction of industrial
   complexes cast more votes for the incumbent party in subsequent
   elections. The effects are larger in elections immediately after the
   appointment of an industrial complex or at the beginning of its
   construction compared to elections held after the completion of
   construction. Furthermore, the study tests and rejects reverse causality
   and migration effects as possible alternative mechanisms for the changes
   in electoral outcomes. Finally, to understand a unique feature of
   authoritarian elections, it tests whether industrial complexes affect
   electoral fraud. Using a genetic matching methodology, it finds that
   places with new industrial complexes are less likely to experience
   electoral fraud.

   understanding of this controversy by tracking the left-right position
   and party identification of thousands of individuals over an
   eighteen-year period in England before and after residential moves
   across areas with different political orientations. There is evidence of
   both non-random selection into areas and assimilation of new entrants to

   procedure that better reflects the data-generating process of party
   manifestos. This new estimator allows us to recover not only positional
   estimates, but also estimates for the ideological clarity or ambiguity
   of parties. The study validates its results using Monte Carlo tests, a
   manifesto-drafting simulation and a human coding exercise. Finally, the
   article applies the estimator to party manifestos in four multiparty
   democracies and demonstrates that ambiguity can enhance the appeal of

   of parties with platforms that become more extreme.

   government parties listen less to voters' issue demands. The study also
   posits that niche parties are not generally more responsive to voter
   demands, but that they are more responsive to the concerns of their

   expectations, the study combines data from the Comparative Manifestos

   The study explores this question by examining a core treaty that

   those that do ratify experience significant child labor improvements. By

AB In international disputes, forgone settlement offers are frequently
   lamented, but their impact on the dynamics of ongoing negotiations is
   largely overlooked. In the psychological literature, however, the
   consequences of missing an advantageous action opportunity have been
   studied extensively in the context of the inaction inertia phenomenon.
   According to this literature, forgoing attractive action opportunities
   renders decision makers susceptible to regret and increases the
   likelihood that subsequent opportunities will also be missed. This
   article explores the explanatory potential of the inaction inertia
   effect in the context of international negotiations. Findings based on
   laboratory experiments and analysis of the negotiations between Israel
   and Hamas over the release of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit strongly
   suggest that the concept of inaction inertia can enrich the
   understanding of failures and deadlocks in international negotiations.
   The article defines the conditions that are instrumental in identifying
   inertia-induced deadlocks and discusses factors that encourage the
   termination of inaction inertia and promote dispute settlement.

AB This article considers the historical development of a characteristic
   crucial for the functioning and normative appeal of Westminster systems:
   cohesive legislative parties. It gathers the universe of the 20,000
   parliamentary divisions that took place between 1836 and 1910 in the
   British House of Commons, construct a voting record for every Member of
   Parliament (MP) serving during this time, and conducts analysis that
   aims to both describe and explain the development of cohesive party
   voting. In line with previous work, it shows that - with the exception
   of a chaotic period in the 1840s and 1850s - median discipline was
   always high and increased throughout the century. The study uses novel
   methods to demonstrate that much of the rise in cohesion results from
   the elimination of a rebellious 'left tail' from the 1860s onwards,
   rather than central tendency shifts. In explaining the aggregate trends,
   the article uses panel data techniques and notes that there is scant
   evidence for 'replacement' explanations that involve new members
   behaving in more disciplined ways than those leaving the chamber. It
   offers evidence that more loyal MPs were more likely to obtain
   ministerial posts, and speculates that this and other 'inducement'-based
   accounts offer more promising explanations of increasingly cohesive
   parties.

AB Whether and how violence can be controlled to spare innocent lives is a
   central issue in international relations. The most ambitious effort to
   date has been the International Criminal Court (ICC), designed to
   enhance security and safety by preventing egregious human rights abuses
   and deterring international crimes. We offer the first systematic
   assessment of the ICC's deterrent effects for both state and nonstate
   actors. Although no institution can deter all actors, the ICC can deter
   some governments and those rebel groups that seek legitimacy. We find
   support for this conditional impact of the ICC cross-nationally. Our
   work has implications for the study of international relations and
   institutions, and supports the violence-reducing role of pursuing
   justice in international affairs.

AB This article examines why rebel groups make large demands of governments
   that are inconsistent with their fighting capacity, especially when such
   demands are almost always rejected. We show that making large demands,
   even if ultimately rejected by the government, makes sense for rebels
   who face a credibility dilemma. Such a dilemma is most likely to arise
   when militarily weak rebel groups face governments of uncertain strength
   and can commit to fight credibly only when they believe the government
   is also weak. This results in a counterintuitive set of strategic
   incentives for weak rebels, who choose their demands to ensure that they
   are rejected even when the government is weak. Thus, to make their
   threat to fight credible, weak rebels make large demands that, when
   rejected, result in inefficient fighting. Since most civil wars are
   characterized by weak rebels bargaining with much stronger governments,
   it is important to understand how this particular feature of civil war
   shapes intrawar negotiations between the rebels and the government. We
   develop a model of bargaining between a government and rebel group and
   evaluate its implications using historical data on civil conflict in
   Africa from 1989 to 2010. The results suggest that the tendency for the
   government to be significantly stronger than rebels induces rebel groups
   to make unrealistically large demands.

AB Holy Land Crusades were among the most significant forms of military
   mobilization to occur during the medieval period. Crusader mobilization
   had important implications for European state formation. We find that
   areas with large numbers of Holy Land crusaders witnessed increased
   political stability and institutional development as well as greater
   urbanization associated with rising trade and capital accumulation, even
   after taking into account underlying levels of religiosity and economic
   development. Our findings contribute to a scholarly debate regarding
   when the essential elements of the modern state first began to appear.
   Although our causal mechanismswhich focus on the importance of war
   preparation and urban capital accumulationresemble those emphasized by
   previous research, we date the point of critical transition to statehood
   centuries earlier, in line with scholars who emphasize the medieval
   origins of the modern state. We also point to one avenue by which the
   rise of Muslim military and political power may have affected European
   institutional development.

AB To reach agreement, international negotiators often compromise by using
   flexible language: they make controversial provisions vague, or add
   options and caveats. Does flexibility in agreement language influence
   subsequent state behavior? If so, do states follow both firm and
   flexible language somewhat, as negotiators hope? Or do governments
   respond strategically, increasing their energies on firmly specified
   tasks, and reducing their efforts on flexibly specified ones? Testing
   theories about agreement language is difficult because states often
   reserve flexible language for controversial provisions. To make causal
   claims, we study an unusually drafted agreement in which states had
   almost no opportunity to dilute agreement language. We examine the
   influence of the 1991 Paris Principles on the Design of National Human
   Rights Institutions (NHRIs), using an original data set of twenty-two
   institutional safeguards of NHRIs in 107 countries, and case studies. We
   find that variations in agreement language can have large effects on
   state behavior, even when the entire agreement is nonbinding. Both
   democracies and authoritarian states followed the principles' firm terms
   closely. However, authoritarian states either ignored or reduced their
   efforts on flexibly specified tasks. If flexibly specifying a task is no
   different from omitting it altogether, as our data suggest, the costs of
   compromise are much greater than previously believed.

AB Despite widespread agreement that status matters, there is relatively
   little in the way of focused research on how and when it matters.
   Relying on the assumption that it matters has provided few extant
   theories of variation in states' concern for status and little
   understanding of its specific implications for international conflict. I
   introduce a theory of status dissatisfaction (SD) that clarifies who
   forms the basis for status comparisons in world politics, when status
   concerns should be paramount, and how they are linked to international
   conflict. I demonstrate the viability of conflict as a strategy for
   status enhancement: both initiation and victory bring substantial status
   benefits over both five- and ten-year periods. Using a new,
   network-based measure of international status, I demonstrate that status
   deficits are significantly associated with an increased probability of
   war and militarized interstate dispute (MID) initiation. Even
   internationally, status is local: I use community detection algorithms
   to recover status communities and show that deficits within those
   communities are particularly salient for states and leaders.

AB Hierarchy-centered approaches to IR promise to deliver what
   anarchy-centered approaches have not: a framework for theorizing and
   empirically analyzing world politics as a global system rather than just
   an international one. At the core of this proposition are three features
   of hierarchical systems as they are represented across the growing IR
   literature on the topic. First, the structures of differentiation at the
   core of hierarchical systems are deeply implicated with power.
   Hierarchical systems are thus intrinsically political. Second, in world
   politics, hierarchies stratify, rank, and organize the relations not
   only among states but also other kinds of actors as well, and often even
   a mix of different actors within a single structure of differentiation.
   Third, there are many different kinds of hierarchical relations in world
   politics, each of which generate different logics influencing social,
   moral, and behavioral outcomes. Hierarchy has been understood in the IR
   literature in two ways: narrowly, as a relationship of legitimate
   authority; and broadly, as intersubjective manifestations of organized
   inequality. Hierarchy operates in a variety of different ways that range
   from ordering solutions to deep structures. We identify three such
   logics that have been fruitfully explored in IR scholarship and that can
   form the basis of a future research agenda: hierarchy as an
   institutionalized functional bargain between actors (a logic of
   trade-offs); hierarchy as differentiated social and political roles
   shaping behavior (a logic of positionality); and hierarchy as a
   productive political space or structure (a logic of productivity).

AB This article investigates the role of intercity transport costs in
   determining the income of sub-Saharan African cities. In particular,
   focusing on fifteen countries whose largest city is a port, I find that
   an oil price increase of the magnitude experienced between 2002 and 2008
   induces the income of cities near that port to increase by 7% relative
   to otherwise identical cities 500 km farther away. Combined with
   external estimates, this implies an elasticity of city economic activity
   with respect to transport costs of -0.28 at 500 km from the port.
   Moreover, the effect differs by the surface of roads between cities.
   Cities connected to the port by paved roads are chiefly affected by
   transport costs to the port, while cities connected to the port by
   unpaved roads are more affected by connections to secondary centres.

AB This article examines critical news reporting in China as an instance of
   collective resistance in authoritarian contexts. It draws on field
   theory to understand why and how news media in certain localities were
   able to resist political pressure and report critically on important
   social problems, despite limited media freedom. Through a comparative
   study of six newspaper organizations in the three coastal cities of
   Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai, the article demonstrates the
   significance of local field environment for critical news reporting. The
   findings reveal how site-specific field environments can alternately
   enable or constrain collective resistance in an authoritarian context.
   In localities where the journalist communities were paired with a
   competitive newspaper market and less unified state agencies, the field
   environment allowed journalists to produce critical news reports. But
   when the local political and economic fields were less fragmented and
   competitive, respectively, the opposite was true.

   negative workplace social climates than men are or if, instead, men and

   token men and token women are equally likely to exhibit a physiological
   stress response to social exclusion on the basis of gender. A second
   experiment shows that token men and token women who are socially
   included do not exhibit physiological stress response. Findings imply
   that (1) social exclusion on the basis of gender may be associated with
   physiological stress response and consequent negative health outcomes
   and (2) combined social-structural and social-interactional components
   of token women's workplace climates would be stressors to both men and

   between race and punishment, while a second investigates stratification
   and colorism, defined as discrimination based on skin tone. Yet rarely
   do scholars examine these issues together. The current study uses new
   data to investigate the association between offender's skin tone,
   Afrocentric facial features, and criminal punishment. More than 850
   booking photos of black and white male offenders in two Minnesota
   counties were coded and then matched to detailed sentencing records.
   Results indicate that darker skin tone and Afrocentric facial features
   are associated with harsher sanctions and that the latter effect is
   particularly salient for white defendants. The findings add to existing
   work on skin tone and stratification and suggest that future research
   should consider other aspects of appearance, such as facial features, in
   the study of punishment and inequality.

AB Concerns about neighborhood erosion and conflict in ethnically diverse
   settings occupy scholars, policy makers, and pundits alike; but the
   empirical evidence is inconclusive. This article proposes the contested
   boundaries hypothesis as a refined contextual explanation focused on
   poorly defined boundaries between ethnic and racial groups. The authors
   argue that neighborhood conflict is more likely to occur at fuzzy
   boundaries defined as interstitial or transitional areas sandwiched
   between two homogeneous communities. Edge detection algorithms from
   computer vision and image processing allow them to identify these
   boundaries. Data from 4.7 million time-and geo-coded 311 service
   requests from New York City support their argument: complaints about
   neighbors making noise, drinking in public, or blocking the driveway are
   more frequent at fuzzy boundaries rather than crisp, polarized borders.
   By focusing on the broader sociospatial structure, the contested
   boundaries hypothesis overcomes the "aspatial" treatment of
   neighborhoods as isolated areas in research on ethnic diversity.

AB With two experiments the authors test and find support for the argument
   that in small, collectively oriented task groups, status affects social
   influence the most when the distribution of opinions reduces the least
   uncertainty. Moreover, they demonstrate that people use the distribution
   of both status and opinions to reduce uncertainty about the task on
   which they are working and that this, in turn, promotes social
   influence. Experiment 1 illustrates that, regardless of the group's sex
   composition, basis for status differentiation, or size of the group,
   uncertainty reduction mediates a significant share of the effect of
   status and opinions on social influence. Experiment 2 confirms that the
   effect of the distribution of both status and opinions on social
   influence is weaker as the task becomes more certain. These findings

AB Using the intuition that financial markets transfer risks in business
   time, "market microstructure invariance" is defined as the hypotheses
   that the distributions of risk transfers ("bets") and transaction costs
   are constant across assets when measured per unit of business time. The
   invariance hypotheses imply that bet size and transaction costs have
   specific, empirically testable relationships to observable dollar volume
   and volatility. Portfolio transitions can be viewed as natural
   experiments for measuring transaction costs, and individual orders can
   be treated as proxies for bets. Empirical tests based on a data set of
   400,000+ portfolio transition orders support the invariance hypotheses.
   The constants calibrated from structural estimation imply specific
   predictions for the arrival rate of bets ("market velocity"), the
   distribution of bet sizes, and transaction costs.

   conditions under which, in equilibrium, price impact and price
   volatility are both stochastic, driven by shocks to uninformed volume
   even though the fundamental value is constant. The volatility of price
   volatility appears 'excessive' because insiders choose to trade more
   aggressively (and thus more information is revealed) when uninformed
   volume is higher and price impact is lower. This generates a positive

AB We propose a semiparametric two-step inference procedure for a

   high-frequency data. The population moment conditions take the form of
   temporally integrated functionals of state-variable processes that
   include the latent stochastic volatility process of an asset. In the
   first step, we nonparametrically recover the volatility path from
   high-frequency asset returns. The nonparametric volatility estimator is
   then used to form sample moment functions in the second-step GMM
   estimation, which requires the correction of a high-order nonlinearity
   bias from the first step. We show that the proposed estimator is
   consistent and asymptotically mixed Gaussian and propose a consistent
   estimator for the conditional asymptotic variance. We also construct a
   Bierens-type consistent specification test. These infill asymptotic
   results are based on a novel empirical-process-type theory for general
   integrated functionals of noisy semimartingale processes.

AB This article asks whether standard accounts of class reproduction apply
   among migrants and their descendants as among the majority group,
   whether there is a process of assimilation across generations toward the
   overall (British) pattern of class reproduction, whether the trends over
   time in absolute and relative mobility among the majority population are
   mirrored among migrants and their descendants, and whether trends in
   class reproduction are mirrored in trends in ethnic stratification.
   Using national representative surveys covering four decades, the authors
   find a major generational shift, with the first generation experiencing
   a notable social decline but the second generation having a clear
   advancement. Relative mobility rates among migrants and their
   descendants are close to those of the majority group and exhibit similar
   trends over time. Ethnic stratification also appears to be slowly
   declining, although the persistence of unemployment among the second
   generation qualifies the optimistic story of ethnic socioeconomic
   assimilation.

   The principal designs a robust contract that maximizes his utility under
   the worst-case scenario subject to the agent's incentive and
   participation constraints. Robustness generates endogenous belief
   heterogeneity and induces a tradeoff between incentives and ambiguity
   sharing so that the incentive constraint does not always bind. We
   implement the optimal contract by cash reserves, debt, and equity. In
   addition to receiving ordinary dividends when cash reserves reach a
   threshold, outside equity holders also receive special dividends or
   inject cash in the cash reserves to hedge against model uncertainty and
   smooth dividends. The equity premium and the credit yield spread
   generated by ambiguity aversion are state dependent and high for
   distressed firms with low cash reserves.

   threats. We conduct a two-wave national survey experiment with 1,799
   participants consisting of a randomized sample of Anglos and randomized,
   stratified oversamples of African Americans and Latinos. The experiment
   manipulates racial/ethnic cues in a vignette depicting an ambiguous yet
   potentially threatening incident at an immigrant detention center.
   African Americans and Latinos are significantly more likely to side with
   minority detainees and support pro-civil rights policies and actions.
   The theory's presumed causal mechanismgroup empathyis substantially
   stronger among African Americans and Latinos and has a significant

AB In the analysis of causal effects in non-experimental studies,
   conditioning on observable covariates is one way to try to reduce
   unobserved confounder bias. However, a developing literature has shown
   that conditioning on certain covariates may increase bias, and the
   mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been fully explored. We
   add to the literature on bias-increasing covariates by first introducing
   a way to decompose omitted variable bias into three constituent parts:
   bias due to an unobserved confounder, bias due to excluding observed
   covariates, and bias due to amplification. This leads to two important
   findings. Although instruments have been the primary focus of the bias
   amplification literature to date, we identify the fact that the popular
   approach of adding group fixed effects can lead to bias amplification as
   well. This is an important finding because many practitioners think that
   fixed effects are a convenient way to account for any and all
   group-level confounding and are at worst harmless. The second finding
   introduces the concept of bias unmasking and shows how it can be even
   more insidious than bias amplification in some cases. After introducing
   these new results analytically, we use constructed observational placebo
   studies to illustrate bias amplification and bias unmasking with real
   data. Finally, we propose a way to add bias decomposition information to
   graphical displays for sensitivity analysis to help practitioners think
   through the potential for bias amplification and bias unmasking in
   actual applications.

   incorporate some form of prior information into the model. The most
   sophisticated research uses Jeffreys' invariant prior to stabilize the
   estimates. While Jeffreys' prior has the advantage of being automatic, I
   show that it often provides too much prior information, producing
   smaller point estimates and narrower confidence intervals than even
   highly skeptical priors. To help researchers assess the amount of
   information injected by the prior distribution, I introduce the concept

AB In this article, we evaluate the usefulness of Google Consumer Surveys
   (GCS) as a low-cost tool for doing rigorous social scientific work. We
   find that its relative strengths and weaknesses make it most useful to
   researchers who attempt to identify causality through randomization to
   treatment groups rather than selection on observables. This finding
   stems, in part, from the fact that the real cost advantage of GCS over
   other alternatives is limited to short surveys with a small number of
   questions. Based on our replication of four canonical social scientific
   experiments and one study of treatment heterogeneity, we find that the
   platform can be used effectively to achieve balance across treatment
   groups, explore treatment heterogeneity, include manipulation checks,
   and that the provided inferred demographics may be sufficiently sound
   for weighting and explorations of heterogeneity. Crucially, we
   successfully managed to replicate the usual directional finding in each
   experiment. Overall, GCS is likely to be a useful platform for survey
   experimentalists.

   viable approach for estimating legislator-specific scores from the
   entire speech corpus of a legislature, while also producing extensive
   information about the evolution of speech polarization and politically
   loaded language. In the Irish Dail, we show that the dominant dimension
   of speech variation is government-opposition, with ministers more
   extreme on this dimension than backbenchers, and a second dimension
   distinguishing between the establishment and anti-establishment
   opposition parties. In the U.S. Senate, we estimate a dimension that has
   moderate within-party correlations with scales based on roll-call votes
   and campaign donation patterns; however, we observe greater overlap
   across parties in speech positions than roll-call positions and partisan
   polarization in speeches varies more clearly in response to major
   political events.

AB Bowers, Fredrickson, and Panagopoulos (2013, Reasoning about
   interference between units: A general framework, Political Analysis
   21(1): 97-124; henceforth BFP) showed that one could use Fisher's
   randomization-based hypothesis testing framework to assess
   counterfactual causal models of treatment propagation and spillover
   across social networks. This research note improves the statistical
   inference presented in BFP (2013) by substituting a test statistic based
   on a sum of squared residuals and incorporating information about the
   fixed network for the simple Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic
   (Hollander 1999, section 5.4) they used. This note incrementally
   improves the application of BFP's "reasoning about interference"
   approach. We do not offer general results about test statistics for
   multi-parameter causal models on social networks here, but instead hope
   to stimulate further, and deeper, work on test statistics and sharp
   hypothesis testing.

AB Legislative redistricting alters the political and electoral context for
   some voters but not others, thus offering a potentially promising
   research design to study many questions of interest in political
   science. We apply this design to study the effect that descriptive
   representation has on co-ethnic political engagement, focusing on
   Hispanic participation following California's 2000 redistricting cycle.
   We show that when redistrictors draw legislative boundaries in
   California's 1990, 2000, and 2010 apportionment cycles, they
   systematically sort higher-participating Hispanic voters into
   majority-Hispanic (MH) jurisdictions represented by co-ethnic
   candidates, biasing subsequent comparisons of Hispanic participation
   across districts. Similar sorting occurs during redistricting in Florida
   and Texas, though here the pattern is reversed, with less-participating
   Hispanic voters redistricted to MH districts. Our study highlights
   important heterogeneity in redistricting largely unknown or
   underappreciated in previous research. Ignoring this selection problem
   could significantly bias estimates of the effect of Hispanic
   representation, either positively or negatively. After we correct for
   these biases using a hierarchical genetic matching algorithm, we find
   that, in California, being moved to a district with an Hispanic
   incumbent has little impact on Hispanic participation in our data.

AB This article explores a key question in political sociology: Can
   post-communist policy-making be described with classical theories of the
   Western state or do we need a theory of the specificity of the
   post-communist state? In so doing, we consider Janine Wedel's clique
   theory, concerned with informal social actors and processes in
   post-communist transition. We conducted a case study of drug
   reimbursement policy in Poland, using 109 stakeholder interviews,
   official documents and media coverage. Drawing on 'sensitizing concepts'
   from Wedel's theory, especially the notion of 'deniability', we
   developed an explanation of why Poland's reimbursement policy combined
   suboptimal outcomes, procedural irregularities with limited
   accountability of key stakeholders. We argue that deniability was
   created through four main mechanisms: (1) blurred boundaries between
   different types of state authority allowing for the dispersion of blame
   for controversial policy decisions; (2) bridging different sectors by
   'institutional nomads', who often escaped existing conflicts of interest
   regulations; (3) institutional nomads' 'flexible' methods of influence
   premised on managing roles and representations; and (4) coordination of
   resources and influence by elite cliques monopolizing exclusive policy
   expertise. Overall, the greatest power over drug reimbursement was often
   associated with lowest accountability. We suggest, therefore, that the
   clique theory can be generalized from its home domain of explanation in
   foreign aid and privatizations to more technologically advanced policies
   in Poland and other post-communist countries. This conclusion is not
   identical, however, with arguing the uniqueness of the post-communist
   state. Rather, we show potential for using Wedel's account to analyse
   policy-making in Western democracies and indicate scope for its possible
   integration with the classical theories of the state.

AB Situated at the intersection of the Sociology of Death and Sociology of
   the Family, this paper argues that the organization and funding of
   funerals is an overlooked and available lens through which to examine
   cultural and political norms of familial obligation. Drawing on
   interviews with claimants to the Department for Work and Pensions'
   Social Fund Funeral Payment, the paper shows how both responsibility for
   the organization and payment of a funeral is assumed within families,
   and how at times this can be overridden by the state. In highlighting
   the tension between reflexive choice and political norms of family
   espoused in this policy context, it supports Gilding's (2010) assertion
   that understanding family practice through reflexivity alone neglects
   the institutions and conventions within which 'doing' family takes
   place. In so doing, the paper further makes a case for families and
   relational negotiations and tensions to be more explicitly included
   within sociological understanding( s) of death more generally.

AB Following the shooting of Mark Duggan by police on 4 August 2011, there
   were riots in many large cities in the UK. As the rioting was widely
   perceived to be perpetrated by the urban poor, links were quickly made
   with Britain's welfare policies. In this paper, we examine whether the
   riots, and the subsequent media coverage, influenced attitudes toward
   welfare recipients. Using the British Social Attitudes survey, we use
   multivariate difference-in-differences regression models to compare
   attitudes toward welfare recipients among those interviewed before
   (pre-intervention: i.e. prior to 6 August) and after (post-intervention:
   10 August-10 September) the riots occurred (N53,311). We use variation
   in exposure to the media coverage to test theories of media persuasion
   in the context of attitudes toward welfare recipients. Before the riots,
   there were no significant differences between newspaper readers and
   non-readers in their attitudes towards welfare recipients. However,
   after the riots, attitudes diverged. Newspaper readers became more
   likely than non-readers to believe that those on welfare did not really
   deserve help, that the unemployed could find a job if they wanted to and
   that those on the dole were being dishonest in claiming benefits.
   Although the divergence was clearest between right-leaning newspaper and
   non-newspaper readers, we do not a find statistically significant
   difference between right-and left-leaning newspapers. These results
   suggest that media coverage of the riots influenced attitudes towards
   welfare recipients; specifically, newspaper coverage of the riots
   increased the likelihood that readers of the print media expressed
   negative attitudes towards welfare recipients when compared with the
   rest of the population.

   The analysis focuses on the political aspects of this process and is

   Malala's iconization as she was undergoing medical treatment and was
   unable to participate in her iconization. The second part starts when
   Malala enters the global public sphere and begins to actively contribute
   to the iconization process. The third part identifies de-iconizing
   resistance to Malala from Pakistani actors who see her iconization as a

AB Research on partying and nightlife often emphasizes commercial control
   while overlooking participants' creativity and agency. Due to their age,
   appearance and transgressive partying, participants in the Norwegian
   high school graduation celebration have limited access to bars and pubs
   in the ordinary night-time economy. To create alternative party spaces
   under their own control they utilize the spatial opportunities offered
   by automobility. Groups of students get together many years in advance
   and buy old buses which they refurbish to become rolling nightclubs that
   enable them to ` transcend space' through partying while on the move.
   These mobile party spaces provide a material and symbolic centre of
   communion and a tight space for physical assembly that enhances the
   production of intense positive emotions. In a cat-and-mouse game with
   the police, the buses provide a sense of nomadic autonomy, and enable
   participants to drink heavily for days on end. The study examines how
   youth may creatively zone their own party spaces within the context of
   automobility and how these mobile spaces again shape the partying that
   goes on within them. While this party practice opens up for autonomy,
   creativity and social transgressions reminiscent of liminal phases or
   carnivals, at a deeper level participants clearly reproduce class-based
   differences and exaggerate conventional practices and symbols.

AB The study of political legitimacy is divided between prescriptive and
   descriptive approaches. Political philosophy regards legitimacy as
   principled justification, sociology regards legitimacy as public
   support. However, all people can, and occasionally do engage in morally
   reasoning their political life. This paper thus submits that in studying
   socio-political legitimation - the legitimacy-making process - the
   philosophical ought and the sociological is can be bridged. I call this
   construct 'public political thought' (PPT), signifying the public's
   principled moral reasoning of politics, which need not be democratic or
   liberal. The paper lays PPT's foundations and identifies its 'builders'
   and 'building blocks'. I propose that the edifice of PPT is built by
   moral agents constructing and construing socio-moral order (nomization).
   PPT's building blocks are justificatory common beliefs (doxa) and the
   deliberative language of legitimation. I illustrate the merits of this
   groundwork through two empirical puzzles: the end of apartheid and the
   emergence of Quebecois identity.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between perceived ethnic
   diversity at the neighbourhood level and acceptance of minority ethnic
   groups. We draw on a representative survey conducted in two dissimilar
   diversity contexts-Leeds, UK and Warsaw, Poland. The results of
   multilevel models demonstrate that in both cities, an increase in
   perceived ethnic diversity in the neighbourhood is related to an
   increase in ethnic prejudice of White-British and Polish people.
   However, the negative association of subjective perceptions of diversity
   with attitudes depends on the level of actual diversity in the
   neighbourhood. In Leeds, perceived diversity is more strongly negatively
   related with attitudes of residents living in more ethnically diverse
   neighbourhoods, while in Warsaw, in more homogenous neighbourhoods. We
   also find that in Leeds, the relationship between acceptance of minority
   ethnic groups and perceptions of diversity is moderated by the recent
   change in neighbourhood actual diversity (especially inflow of
   minorities of 'other White' and 'Mixed' ethnicity) and change in
   neighbourhood deprivation (increase in council housing). The findings
   testify to the importance of conducting comparative studies of the
   diversity of effects in various settings across Europe and the potential
   of using subjective measures of diversity in future research.

AB This study integrates a life course and social stratification
   perspective to examine early retirement in the Netherlands. Event
   history analysis of retrospective life course data from four rounds of
   the Family Survey Dutch Population reveals that employment career
   characteristics are strongly associated with early retirement. The
   results also show that educational differences in early labour force
   withdrawal persist when controlling for work history: lower-educated
   older men are more likely to exit employment before the age of 65 years,
   irrespective of their employment trajectories. Furthermore,
   working-class elderly face higher risks of disability and unemployment
   than members of the service class and the self-employed, because their
   occupational careers are more volatile and because they often work in
   the industrial sector for a long period of their lives. Against the
   background of ageing populations and policy measures to stimulate
   employment of older people, these findings suggest that social
   inequalities in old age could grow, as particularly less-educated and
   low-skilled older workers may not be able to prolong their employment
   career.

AB Intermarriage with natives has the potential to enhance immigrant
   integration, as intermarried immigrants gain access to resources such as
   language skills, information about institutions and customs, and native
   networks. Due to these spillover effects, immigrants in intermarriages
   are more likely to be successful in the labour market. However, a
   positive relationship between intermarriage and economic integration can
   also be caused by selection based on unobserved characteristics. In
   previous studies, spillover effects have only been studied from the time
   of marriage but could occur in a period of cohabitation before marriage.
   Using unique register data from Denmark, we are able to identify
   cohabiting couples to analyse both intermarriage and exogamous
   cohabitation premiums. We study these effects and address selection in a
   panel data framework, obtaining a time profile of income in relation to
   the start of cohabitation. Results show comparatively high premiums for
   male and female immigrants from countries with lower levels of overall
   economic development and these income increases are directly related to
   relationship formation.

AB In a recent article Sylwia Piatkowska, Steven Messner and Lawrence
   Raffalovich (PMR) (2016) argue that 'entry into the EU is positively
   associated with levels of homicide in the 10 Eastern European countries
   that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007' (pp. 151, 158), with the
   implication that accession to the European Union (EU) caused higher
   homicide rate in the countries that joined the union. In this note, I
   challenge this conclusion and argue that the available empirical
   evidence does not support the inference that accession to the EU
   increased the homicide rate. The positive effect that PMR (2016) report
   is a result of a statistical model specification based on a number of
   unwarranted assumptions and data preprocessing decisions. The
   statistical result cannot be replicated under a broad range of
   alternative, and more plausible, assumptions nor with different
   measures. Furthermore, the result is in clear contradiction with the
   descriptive patterns of the evolution of the homicide rates in central
   and eastern Europe; it does not rest on plausible causal mechanisms; and
   it does not have a clear causal interpretation. In summary, accession to
   the EU is not related to higher homicide rates, neither in descriptive
   nor in causal terms.

AB Are immigrant workers in developed nations relegated to labour market
   positions that are beneath their qualification and skill level? This
   article uses newly available data from the Programme for the
   International Assessment of Adult Competencies to examine immigrant
   economic incorporation in 13 European nations. Our analyses show that
   immigrants in Europe are significantly more likely than natives to hold
   educational qualifications above those necessary for their job, and yet,
   immigrants are significantly less likely to be in jobs that underutilize
   their cognitive skills. Among workers in the highest cognitive
   proficiency levels, however, we find no differences between immigrants
   and natives in predicted overeducation. Therefore, the observed
   discrepancy between qualifications held and qualifications required for
   the job are more likely to indicate 'apparent' qualification mismatch
   rather than 'real' qualification mismatch among immigrants as compared
   with the native population. Based on our findings, we conclude that
   differences in educational quality, language proficiency, and the
   imperfect transferability of skills contribute to high rates of
   overeducation among immigrants.

AB Numerous laboratory experiments have established peer-sanctioning as an
   important driver of norm compliance and cooperation in human groups.
   However, systematic evidence of peer-sanctioning occurring in the field
   is still rare. Here we present results from a quasi-experimental field
   study investigating the enforcement of the silence norm in the train. We
   let a confederate play music on his/her mobile phone in an open-plan
   train car and measure the time until a negative sanction occurs (if
   any). The silence norm is enforced in 45 of 90 cases, enforcement rates
   do not differ across silent-and non-silent-area cars, and the more
   passengers are in a car, the more likely is the silence norm enforced.
   Passengers' propensities to enforce the silence norm are in line with
   predictions derived from the asymmetric volunteer's dilemma (VOD). The
   higher a passenger's net benefit from enforcing the silence norm is, the
   more likely is the passenger to negatively sanction the norm breaker.
   Our findings extend the validity of results from laboratory experiments
   which conceive the second-order free-rider problem as a VOD.

AB Recent statistics show for math and science subjects that test score
   differences between boys and girls have decreased or reversed over the
   past 20 years. This decrease or reversal occurred simultaneously with
   the steady increase in the proportion of female teachers in primary and
   secondary education. It is frequently hypothesized that the feminization
   of education contributed to the reversal of gender achievement gaps.
   This study examines if having a same-gender teacher influences the
   mathematics performance of primary school children. For this purpose,
   unique Dutch school-registration data are used on 2,586 Dutch primary
   school students who are followed from grades 3 to 5, and an innovative
   within-class between-student gender approach is used to identify the
   effect. The main empirical finding is that there is no teacher gender
   effect, in the sense that teacher gender does not affect the difference
   in achieved math test scores between boys and girls.

AB Immigrants' access to and use of welfare benefits have been the subject
   of heated debate in many west-European countries. In this article, I
   examine public solidarity with unemployed welfare claimants and focus on
   how claimants' ethnic background and migration status affect their
   perceived deservingness. I use a novel vignette experiment administered
   among a representative sample of 5,000 respondents from Britain and
   4,000 from the Netherlands. Besides ethnic background and migration
   status, I manipulated six other characteristics of the claimant, such as
   effort to find a new job, level of need, and work history. I show that
   the ethnic background of claimants is not a decisive factor of
   deservingness once these other factors are accounted for. In the
   Netherlands, and to a lesser extent also in Britain, second-generation
   ethnic minorities who have a long work history and who make much effort
   to find a new job are considered as deserving as similar majority
   claimants. However, this analyses did expose a double standard: ethnic
   minority claimants who exhibit 'unfavourable' behaviour-those who
   migrated at a later age, failed to look for work, or have a short work
   history-are punished more severely for this than similar majority Dutch
   or British claimants.

AB Although the Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened in the Soviet Union in
   1986, we still do not know how the most affected states - Ukraine and
   Belarus - have managed this tragedy since independence. Drawing on the
   concept of cultural trauma, this article compares Chernobyl narratives
   in Belarus and Ukraine over the past 28 years. It shows that national
   narratives of Chernobyl differ, representing the varying ways in which
   the state overcomes trauma. Our understanding of post-communist
   transformations can be improved by analysing trauma management
   narratives and their importance for new national identity construction.
   These narratives also bring new insights to our vision of cultural
   trauma by linking it to ontological insecurity. The article demonstrates
   how the state can become an arena of trauma process as it commands
   material and symbolic resources to deal with trauma. In general, it
   contributes to a better understanding of how the same traumatic event
   can become a source of solidarity in one community, but a source of
   hostility in another.

AB Using in-depth interview data on nominal marriages - legal marriages
   between a gay man and a lesbian to give the appearance of
   heterosexuality - this paper develops the concept of performative family
   to explain the processes through which parents and their adult children
   negotiate and resolve disagreements in relation to marriage decisions in
   post-socialist China. We identify three mechanisms - network pressure, a
   revised discourse of filial piety and resource leverage - through which
   parents influence their gay offspring's decision to turn to nominal
   marriage. We also delineate six strategies, namely minimizing network
   participation, changing expectations, making partial concessions,
   drawing the line, delaying decisions and ending the marriage, by which
   gay people in nominal marriages attempt to meet parental expectations
   while simultaneously retaining a degree of autonomy. Through these
   interactions, we argue that Chinese parents and their gay adult children
   implicitly and explicitly collaborate to perform family, emphasizing the
   importance of formally meeting society's expectations about marriage
   rather than substantively yielding to its demands. We also argue that
   the performative family is a pragmatic response to the tension between
   the persistent centrality of family and marriage and the rising tide of
   individualism in postsocialist China. We believe that our findings
   highlight the specific predicament of homosexual people. They also shed
   light on the more general dynamics of intergenerational negotiation
   because there is evidence that the mechanisms used by parents to exert
   influence may well be similar between gay and non-gay people.

AB Bourdieusian Field Theory (BFT) provided decisive inspiration for the
   early conceptual formulation of New Institutionalism (NI). This paper
   attempts to reinvigorate the stalled intellectual dialogue between NI
   and BFT by comparing NI's concept of isomorphism with BFT's notion of
   homology. I argue that Bourdieu's understanding of domination-oriented
   social action, transposable habitus, and a non-linear causality,
   embodied in his neglected concept of homology, provides an alternative
   theorization of field-level convergence to New Institutionalism's
   central idea of institutional isomorphism. To showcase how BFT can be
   useful for organizational research, I postulate a habitus-informed and
   field-conditioned theory of transference to enrich NI's spin-off thesis
   of 'diffusion'. I propose that while NI can benefit from BFT's potential
   of bringing social structure back into organizational research, BFT can
   enrich its social analysis by borrowing from NI's elaboration of the
   symbolic system of organizations.

AB Scholars have conceptualized the interaction between law and
   organizations as a game of tug-of-war in which organizations try to
   protect those internal operations regulated by law. This suggests that
   organizations are likely to substantively comply if symbolic compliance
   alone is insufficient. This conceptualization, however, cannot capture a
   radical response: organizations may stop interpreting legal demands or
   protecting their internal operations and simply leave the game. In this
   case, they change their internal operations in order to disengage from
   the law. I term this negative compliance. In this paper, I identify
   conditions under which this occurs and demonstrate the unexpected
   consequences. Analyzing panel data on corporate responses to Japan's
   equal employment opportunity law and its revision, I show that after the
   revision strengthened the law, firms followed one of three paths:
   substantive compliance (hiring more women); symbolic compliance (no
   change in hiring practices, effectively protecting sex segregation); or
   negative compliance (externalizing female labor and hiring even fewer
   women). I discuss the implications of negative compliance, which is
   likely to be an increasingly common corporate response to regulations.

AB Scholars and public figures have drawn attention to lower social
   spending in more ethnically diverse countries, and explicitly or
   implicitly claimed that this resulted from a lack of public support for
   more generous social-spending policies in more diverse countries-despite
   the lack of empirical evidence on the topic. Such arguments ultimately
   hinge on how diversity is related to attitudes about distribution.
   However, empirical studies of the relationship between social-spending
   attitudes and diversity in cross-national perspective are scarce and
   limited in geographic scope, and have yielded inconsistent results.
   Through a study of individual-level attitudes in 91 countries in this
   paper, I explore the relationship between ethnic diversity and actual
   attitudes about social spending using two different cross-national
   public opinion data sets, and multiple approaches to measuring
   diversity. The results of 48 regression models show that ethnic
   diversity itself is not negatively related, and may even be positively
   related, to support for redistributive social spending, which challenges
   the prevailing assumption about the divisiveness of ethnic diversity.
   There is one exception-support for redistribution may be lower when
   there have been large increases in the size of the immigrant population
   in a country, but only in countries in which economic inequality is
   particularly acute.

AB This study examines differential recognition of top art collectors.
   Using the population of 617 international art collectors named by
   ARTnews, ArtReview, and Art+ Auction from 1990 to 2011, I examine
   factors that affect the extent of a collector's recognition through
   naming on ARTnews's annual list of the world's top collectors. The
   research draws on both humanities and sociological perspectives to model
   two sets of characteristics that may affect the amount of critical
   recognition conferred on a collector. First, conceiving that recognition
   is based on the art object, status characteristics of art collections
   are considered. Next, characteristics of the art collection's owner
   (rather than the art objects themselves) are considered. Findings
   indicate that the extent of recognition a collector receives is based on
   both collection and collector attributes, even when holding the other
   constant. Notably, collections specializing in art originating from both
   culturally dominant and peripheral regions are favored with extended
   critical recognition, though only collectors residing in culturally
   dominant regions are consistently distinguished. Overall, results
   suggest that important overarching status characteristics of object and
   owner affect the extent to which elite taste and expertise are
   critically recognized, with the expectation that the greater the extent
   of recognition, the greater the validation.

AB Past research demonstrates a marked tendency toward "acculturative
   conservatism," whereby immigrants select given names for their children
   that are established-that is, popular in an earlier generation of the
   native population. Prior research has generally understood such
   conservatism as reflecting a lack of "main-stream" cultural capital;
   established names are popular among immigrants because they are unaware
   of current fashion. But we argue and show that even when they are aware
   of current fashion, immigrants may favor established names to affirm
   their membership in the host society. Comparing given names among World
   War II Jewish servicemen (born around 1918) with given names in the
   general US population in 1920, we show that the parents of these
   servicemen exhibited a pattern of acculturation that was (1) selective
   (in avoiding popular native names with strong Christian associations,
   and embracing certain unpopular native names) and (2) conservative (in
   their tendency to favor established names relative to newly popular
   names). In addition, our key finding is that these parents favored those
   established names whose popularity was rising and avoided those whose
   popularity was declining. This suggests that Jewish immigrants were
   aware of mainstream fashion, but deliberately chose established names so
   as to express their membership in American society. More generally, this
   result indicates that the acculturation process is as much about gaining
   social acceptance as about becoming adept in the mainstream culture.

   we disaggregate self-employment by defining four types through an

   supervisory responsibilities or business asset ownership and the other
   divided into so-called "knowledge" and "non-knowledge" occupations. We
   find that job loss shows a strong association with entry into
   self-employment, particularly with less desirable forms of
   self-employment. In addition, we show that there are large differences
   between individuals in these alternative measures of self-employment and
   that there are distinctive factors that influence entry into these
   types. Additionally, we show that there are some differences in the
   factors affecting men's and women's entry into self-employment.

AB Although flexible work arrangements have the potential to reduce gender

   people draw on cultural beliefs about gender to define flexwork and
   evaluate flexworkers. I conducted a controlled online experiment to
   examine the consequences of making a flexible work request and to
   examine how these consequences vary by accommodation type and by gender
   and parental status of the requester. Participants evaluated employees
   who requested flexible work more negatively than employees who did not
   request flexible work, and evaluated workers who requested telecommuting
   (or "flexplace") arrangements more negatively than workers who requested
   flextime arrangements. Men and women who requested flexible work for
   reasons related to childcare were evaluated more positively than those
   who requested flexible work for reasons unrelated to childcare. I also
   found evidence of a fatherhood bonus. Men who made flexplace requests to
   care for a child were significantly advantaged compared to men who made
   flexplace requests for reasons unrelated to childcare. They were also
   advantaged compared to women who made flexplace requests to care for a

AB Although social movement scholars in the United States have long ignored
   activism over immigration, this movement raises important theoretical
   and empirical questions, especially given many immigrants' lack of
   citizenship. Is the rights "master" frame, used extensively by other US
   social movements, persuasive in making claims for noncitizens? If not,
   which other movement frames resonate with the public? We leverage survey
   experiments-largely the domain of political scientists and public
   opinion researchers-to examine how much human/citizenship rights,
   economics, and family framing contests shape Californians' views about
   legalization and immigrants' access to public benefits. We pay
   particular attention to how potentially distinct "publics," or
   subgroups, react, finding significant differences in frame resonance
   between groups distinguished by political ideology. However, alternative
   framings resonate with-at best-one political subgroup and, dauntingly,
   frames that resonate with one group sometimes alienate others. While
   activists and political theorists may hope that human rights appeals can
   expand American notions of membership, such a frame does not help the
   movement build support for legalization. Instead, the most expansive
   change in legalization attitudes occurs when framed as about family
   unity, but this holds only among self-reported conservatives. These
   findings underscore the challenges confronting the immigrant movement
   and the need to reevaluate the assumption that historically progressive
   rights language is effective for immigrant claims-making.

AB In protest, activists sometimes turn to disruptive and violent tactics
   to meet their goals. Doing so, however, can also undermine support for
   their claims. We argue that how protestors weigh this trade-off depends
   on their targets and the extent to which their claims appeal to diverse
   constituencies, which then factors greatly into their choice of protest
   tactics. We complement past work that suggests that forces of
   professionalization and counter pressure alter activists' tendency to
   use violent and disruptive tactics. With data on over 23,000 protest
   events in the United States between 1960 and 1995, we find that protest
   events characterized by broadly resonating claims are more likely to
   employ tactics that are disruptive but nonviolent. By contrast, events
   espousing narrower claims are more likely to employ disruptive tactics
   that are also violent. Moreover, when governmental entities are
   targeted, protests are less likely to witness the use of both violent
   and nonviolent disruptive tactics. We discuss the implications of our
   results for social movement theory and the dynamics of collective
   violence.

AB In this article, we elucidate two new mechanisms for the rise in
   earnings inequality during post-socialist transition. First, the
   integration of transition country firms into globalized production
   networks (GPNs) should increase inequality independent of foreign direct
   investment (FDI). Second, because EU integration hastened the transition
   from Soviet-era labor-market practices, the distributional effects of
   private markets and world-economic integration should be larger among
   acceding countries. A longitudinal analysis of Gini coefficients among
   sixteen transition countries from 1991 to 2009 supports these
   interventions: GPN integration increases inequality independent of FDI,
   and both private markets and world-economic integration have stronger
   effects in EU transition countries. These results are robust to a host
   of alternative explanations, to varying operationalizations of the
   labor-market effects of EU integration, and to alternative estimators.
   Through counterfactual analysis, we show that inequality would have
   increased less dramatically in the absence of EU integration.

AB A central tenet of economic sociology is that social ties among actors
   can both facilitate and constrain economic exchanges between them.
   Recent scholars have extended these ideas to the global system by
   examining how social ties formed through international organizations
   enable or inhibit economic exchanges between countries. Similarly, this
   paper examines the relationship between shared organizational
   memberships and bilateral aid flows between donor and recipient
   countries from 1978 to 2010. We propose that joint membership in
   international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and
   intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) facilitates aid flows from donor
   to recipient. However, we also suggest that this relationship is
   contingent upon the level of development in the recipient country.
   Results from a multistage analysis of more than 61,000 donor-recipient
   dyads show that while shared memberships strongly increase the
   likelihood of an aid relationship between countries, they tend to
   predict increased volumes of aid only for recipient countries at the
   lowest levels of development as measured by GDP. Findings suggest that
   an institutional approach is needed to fully understand the relational
   dynamics of aid flows in the contemporary period.

AB A vast literature demonstrates how personal networks mirror and
   reproduce broader patterns of social inequality. The availability of key
   resources through informal mechanisms is an important way that
   high-status Americans retain a host of social advantages. Largely absent
   from this account of social capital inequality, however, is an explicit
   temporal dimension. The current article addresses that gap by targeting
   the dynamic nature of personal networks. Specifically, we consider
   whether race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated
   with how US adults' resource-providing ties persist or vanish between
   two time points. Using panel data from the Portraits of American Life
   Study, we find that non-Whites and lower-SES Americans tend to receive
   useful advice and practical help from fewer close ties than do White and
   higher-SES adults, while Black Americans are especially likely to
   receive financial assistance from their network members. Models fail to
   indicate that non-Whites lose these resourceful ties at a
   disproportionate rate over time. On the other hand, we find that income
   has a robust association with the ability to retain ties initially
   providing advice and help. We interpret the latter findings as a
   temporal manifestation of network-based inequality. The maintenance gap
   between higher-and lower-SES Americans, we argue, can reinforce other
   social capital disparities by shaping dependable access to important
   resources and by altering their ability to effectively mobilize
   resources. Network maintenance is a concept that could be useful to
   researchers studying how social capital matters for a variety of
   instrumental and expressive outcomes.

AB An increasing amount of sociological research is directed at unpacking
   the social processes behind neighborhood effects on youth behavioral
   outcomes. The goal of the current study is to build upon these prior
   efforts and advance research on neighborhood cultural mechanisms and
   adolescent sexual-partnering behaviors. We formulate and test a series
   of multilevel hypotheses informed by Anderson's research on the
   relationship between neighborhood cultural processes and multiple sexual
   partnering or "player-like" sexual behavior. The hypotheses are tested
   using data from a multisite sample of African American adolescent males
   from the Family and Community Health Study. Results from a series of
   multilevel models provide evidence of both contextual and indirect
   effects of neighborhood culture on sexual partnering; moreover, these
   effects are conditioned by neighborhood structural deprivation.

AB Neighborhood effects scholarship suggests that neighborhoods may impart
   different effects across the early life-course because children's
   interactions with neighborhood actors and institutions evolve across the
   stages of child development. This paper expands our understanding of
   neighborhood effects on cognitive and non-cognitive development across
   childhood and early adolescence by capitalizing on thirteen waves of
   restricted and never-before-used longitudinal data from the NLSY Child
   and Young Adult (1986-2010) sample. The findings from within-child
   fixed-effects interaction models suggest that while younger children are
   immune to neighborhood effects on their cognitive development, older
   children consistently suffer a steep penalty for growing up in
   disadvantaged neighborhoods. This neighborhood disadvantage penalty
   persists among older children despite alternative age constructs.
   Further, the results are robust to various adjustments for observed and
   unobserved sources of bias, model specifications, and also manifest as
   cumulative and lagged effects.

AB A growing number of U.S. states have adopted millionaire taxes on top
   income-earners. This increases the progressivity of state tax systems,
   but it raises concerns about tax flight: elites migrating from high-tax
   to low-tax states, draining state revenues, and undermining
   redistributive social policies. Are top income-earners transitory
   millionaires searching for lower-tax places to live? Or are they
   embedded elites who are reluctant to migrate away from places where they
   have been highly successful? This question is central to understanding
   the social consequences of progressive taxation. We draw on
   administrative tax returns for all million-dollar income-earners in the
   United States over 13 years, tracking the states from which millionaires
   file their taxes. Our dataset contains 45 million tax records and
   provides census-scale panel data on top income-earners. We advance two
   core analyses: (1) state-to-state migration of millionaires over the
   long-term, and (2) a sharply-focused discontinuity analysis of
   millionaire population along state borders. We find that millionaire tax
   flight is occurring, but only at the margins of statistical and
   socioeconomic significance.

AB Recent sociological work shows that pro-market neoliberal policies
   across advanced capitalist countries are due to distributional struggle
   between classes in the 1970s and 1980s. The orthodox monetarist view,
   alternatively, sees neoliberal reform as a nonpolitical attempt to end
   the stagflation crisis of the 1970s. From this perspective, monetary and
   fiscal expansions brought high inflation, and central bank discipline
   and government austerity is the solution; but the recent trend of low
   inflation despite accelerating money growth and government spending
   contradicts this view. Analyses of time-series cross-section data for 23
   OECD countries from 1960 to 2009 support the thesis that the rise and
   fall of inflation is more about distribution of power between labor and
   capital than about monetary and fiscal discipline. Inflation in the
   1970s originated from a strong working class and hurt capital more than
   it did workers, while neoliberal repression of workers' power has kept
   inflation low from the 1980s onward. Disempowerment of labor created
   rising inequality and economic imbalances that fueled a financial boom
   underlying the global financial crisis of 2008. Re-empowering labor is a
   remedy to such imbalances and the subsequent deflationary pressure.

AB A key debate in research on corporate restructuring is whether this
   widespread and extensive transformation process made contemporary
   employment relationships more openwith firms relying largely on market
   forces to reward employeesor left them relatively closed, with wages
   remaining primarily a function of internal labor market systems,
   practices, and policies. Research in this arena has had conceptual and
   empirical challenges in clearly distinguishing between these contrasting
   perspectives, leaving open the question of whether corporate
   restructuring reflects a full-fledged transformation in wage patterns,
   determinants, and outcomes, or instead erosion around the margins. We
   seek to resolve this debate by extending, refining, and assessing a
   rent-destruction account of the effect of corporate restructuring on
   employment relationshipswhich we contrast with internal labor market
   approaches. Results from analyses of 25 years of personnel records from
   a Fortune 500 energy-sector firm are consistent with the
   rent-destruction account: employment relationships became more
   market-based following the onset of corporate restructuringalbeit with
   production workers' contracts seemingly becoming more open than those of
   managers.

AB Why is there no labor party in the United States? This question has had
   deep implications for U.S. politics and social policy. Existing
   explanations use reflection models of parties, whereby parties reflect
   preexisting cleavages or institutional arrangements. But a comparison
   with Canada, whose political terrain was supposedly more favorable to
   labor parties, challenges reflection models. Newly compiled electoral
   data show that underlying social structures and institutions did not
   affect labor party support as expected: support was similar in both
   countries prior to the 1930s, then diverged. To explain this, I propose
   a modified articulation model of parties, emphasizing parties' role in
   assembling and naturalizing political coalitions within structural
   constraints. In both cases, ruling party responses to labor and agrarian
   unrest during the Great Depression determined which among a range of
   possible political alliances actually emerged. In the United States, FDR
   used the crisis to mobilize new constituencies. Rhetorical appeals to
   the forgotten man and policy reforms absorbed some farmer and labor
   groups into the New Deal coalition and divided and excluded others,
   undermining labor party support. In Canada, mainstream parties excluded
   farmer and labor constituencies, leaving room for the Cooperative
   Commonwealth Federation (CCF) to organize them into a third-party
   coalition.

AB Social movement researchers argue that tactical innovation occurs as a
   response to changes external to movements, such as police repression and
   shifts in political authority, or is due to internal movement processes,
   such as the characteristics of movement organizations and actors. In
   this study, we locate the roots of tactical innovation in the
   multiplicity of movement claims articulated at protest events. With data
   on more than 23,000 protest events that took place in the United States
   between 1960 and 1995, we develop novel measures of two forms of
   tactical innovation and the relationships between protest event claims.
   Our results show that multi-issue protest events are more likely to use
   novel recombinations of tactics, and protest events with more peripheral
   movement claims tend to introduce new protest tactics. Our approach
   brings together work on social movement dynamics, innovation, and field
   theoretic approaches to theorize about the relationship between the
   tools and content of activism.

AB Past research shows that income segregation between neighborhoods
   increased over the past several decades. In this article, I reexamine
   income segregation from 1990 to 2010 in the 100 largest metropolitan
   areas, and I find that income segregation increased only among families
   with children. Among childless householdstwo-thirds of the
   populationincome segregation changed little and is half as large as
   among households with children. I examine two factors that may account
   for these differences by household composition. First, I find that
   increasing income inequality, identified by past research as a driver of
   income segregation, was a much more powerful predictor of income
   segregation among families with children, among whom income inequality
   has risen more. Second, I find that local school options, delineated by
   school district boundaries, contribute to higher segregation among
   households with children compared to households without. Rising income
   inequality provided high-income households more resources, and parents
   used these resources to purchase housing in particular neighborhoods,
   with residential decisions structured, in part, by school district
   boundaries. Overall, results indicate that children face greater and
   increasing stratification in neighborhood contexts than do all
   residents, and this has implications for growing inequalities in their
   future outcomes.

AB This study shows that state efforts at child protection are structured
   by the policy regimes in which they are enmeshed. Using administrative
   data on child protection, criminal justice, and social welfare
   interventions, I show that children are separated from their families
   and placed into foster care far more frequently in states with extensive
   and punitive criminal justice systems than in states with broad and
   generous welfare programs. However, large welfare bureaucracies interact
   with welfare program enrollment to create opportunities for the
   surveillance of families, suggesting that extensive and administratively
   complex welfare states engage in soft social control through the
   surveillance and regulation of family behavior. The article further
   shows that institutionalization, a particularly restrictive form of
   foster care placement, is least common in states with broad and generous
   welfare regimes and generally more common under punitive regimes. Taken
   together, these findings show that policy regimes influence the
   interaction between families and the state through their proximate
   effects on family structure and well-being and through institutional
   effects that delimit the routines and scripts through which policymakers
   and street-level bureaucrats intervene to protect children.

AB Did the nation-state spread due to global diffusion? Wimmer and
   Feinstein's 2010 ASR article concludes that there are no world polity
   influences on the rise of the nation-state; rather, the spread of the
   nation-state was driven by proximate and contextual political factors
   situated at the local and regional levels, in line with historical
   institutionalist arguments. Here, after arguing that Wimmer and
   Feinstein misspecify the historical domain of the world polity theory,
   we reanalyze their data and find that world polity has played a
   consistent role in the global rise of the nation-state since WWII.
   Specifically, global diffusion processes complement the more local and
   regional varieties of causal processes stressed by historical
   institutionalist theorists. We measure the institutionalization of world
   polity with inter-governmental organizations (IGOs), international
   nongovernmental organizations (INGOs), and processes through which
   potential nation-states mimic existing nation-states. IGO membership and
   existing nation-states show positive significance in the post-1945
   period, and all three measures significantly facilitate nation-state
   creation for 1953 to 2001, the period for which INGO data are available.
   Results affirm the importance of state legitimacy secured by adapting
   the global model of the nation-state.

   which made it hard for them to engage in market work. Between 1930 and
   1960 there was a remarkable improvement in maternal health. We argue

   is comparative advantage. (2) Imperfect competition allows high- and

AB This paper examines populist claims-making in US presidential elections.
   We define populism as a discursive strategy that juxtaposes the virtuous
   populace with a corrupt elite and views the former as the sole
   legitimate source of political power. In contrast to past research, we
   argue that populism is best operationalized as an attribute of political
   claims rather than a stable ideological property of political actors.
   This analytical strategy allows us to systematically measure how the use
   of populism is affected by a variety of contextual factors. Our
   empirical case consists of 2,406 speeches given by American presidential
   candidates between 1952 and 1996, which we code using automated text
   analysis. Populism is shown to be a common feature of presidential
   politics among both Democrats and Republicans, but its prevalence varies
   with candidates' relative positions in the political field. In
   particular, we demonstrate that the probability of a candidate's
   reliance on populist claims is directly proportional to his distance
   from the center of power (in this case, the presidency). This suggests
   that populism is primarily a strategic tool of political challengers,
   and particularly those who have legitimate claims to outsider status. By
   examining temporal changes in populist claims-making on the political
   left and right, its variation across geographic regions and field
   positions, and the changing content of populist frames, our paper
   contributes to the debate on populism in modern democracies, while
   integrating field theory with the study of institutional politics.

AB Gender gaps in religiosity among Western populations, such that women

   for these differences range from biological predispositions of risk
   aversion to patriarchal gender socialization, but all largely overlook
   the intersection of social statuses. Drawing on theories of
   intersectionality, we contribute to the cultural and empirical analysis
   of gender gaps in religiosity by documenting an interactive effect
   between gender, education, and political views for predicting religious
   nonaffiliation and infrequent attendance at religious services among
   Americans. For highly educated political liberals, gender gaps
   effectively disappear, such that men and women are almost equally likely
   to be secular (or religious). The results have implications for the
   long-standing disputes about the gendered "nature" of religiosity and
   highlight the importance of multiple intersecting statuses and
   modalities in shaping aggregate patterns of religiosity and secularity.

   adoption using cross-national data. We address three views: (1) a
   bottom-up perspective, prioritizing the role of domestic NGOs; (2) an
   interaction imagery, stressing alliances or reinforcing pressures
   between domestic and international NGOs; (3) a top-down view,
   emphasizing the part of international NGOs. We use event history
   analysis to model the cross-national adoption of three major
   pro-environmental policy reforms between 1970 and 2010: omnibus
   environmental laws, environmental impact assessment reporting
   requirements, and national environmental ministries. Results show that
   international NGOs are strongly associated with pro-environmental
   reforms, with very large effects. By contrast, domestic NGOs are
   generally not associated with policy adoption in global analyses. In a
   subsample of democratic countries, we find smaller effects of domestic
   NGOs for some outcomes. We find no evidence that international NGOs
   amplify the effects of domestic ones. While there are compelling
   historical examples of bottom-up and interaction processes, the broad
   pattern of environmental policy adoption across the world is better
   explained by global rather than domestic organizational dynamics.

   relationships and housing quality. Housing Survey data reveal that
   diversity induces social anomie. Through the channel of anomie,
   diversity accounts for the inability of residents to sanction others for
   vandalism and to act collectively to demand proper building maintenance.
   However, anomie also lowers opportunities for violent confrontations,
   which are not related to diversity.

AB I investigate how teamwork may reduce moral hazard by joint monitoring
   and management. I study two organizational systems differing in the
   extent to which physicians may mutually manage work: Physicians are
   assigned patients in a nurse-managed system but divide patients between
   themselves in a self-managed system. The self-managed system increases
   throughput productivity by reducing a foot-dragging moral hazard, in
   which physicians prolong patient stays as expected future work
   increases. I find evidence that physicians in the same location have
   better information about each other and that, in the self-managed
   system, they use this information to assign patients.

AB We propose a theory of self-fulfilling unemployment fluctuations. When a
   firm increases its workforce, it raises demand and weakens competition
   facing other firms, as employed workers spend more and have less time to
   search for low prices than unemployed workers. These effects induce
   other firms to hire more labor in order to scale up their presence in
   the product market. The feedback between employment and product market
   conditions generates multiple equilibriaand the possibility of
   self-fulfilling fluctuationsif differences in shopping behavior between
   employed and unemployed are large enough. Evidence on spending,
   shopping, and prices suggests that this is the case.

   framework captures observed and unobserved preference heterogeneity
   across households and locations in a flexible way. We estimate the model
   using a newly assembled data set that matches demographic information
   from mortgage applications to the universe of housing transactions in
   the San Francisco Bay Area from 1994 to 2004. The results provide the
   first estimates of the marginal willingness to pay for several
   non-marketed amenities-neighborhood air pollution, violent crime, and
   racial composition-in a dynamic framework. Comparing these estimates
   with those from a static version of the model highlights several
   important biases that arise when dynamic considerations are ignored.

AB We develop an econometric methodology to infer the path of risk premia
   from a large unbalanced panel of individual stock returns. We estimate
   the time-varying risk premia implied by conditional linear asset pricing
   models where the conditioning includes both instruments common to all
   assets and asset-specific instruments. The estimator uses simple
   weighted two-pass cross-sectional regressions, and we show its
   consistency and asymptotic normality under increasing cross-sectional
   and time series dimensions. We address consistent estimation of the
   asymptotic variance by hard thresholding, and testing for asset pricing
   restrictions induced by the no-arbitrage assumption. We derive the
   restrictions given by a continuum of assets in a multi-period economy
   under an approximate factor structure robust to asset repackaging. The
   empirical analysis on returns for about ten thousand U.S. stocks from
   July 1964 to December 2009 shows that risk premia are large and volatile
   in crisis periods. They exhibit large positive and negative strays from
   time-invariant estimates, follow the macroeconomic cycles, and do not
   match risk premia estimates on standard sets of portfolios. The asset
   pricing restrictions are rejected for a conditional four-factor model
   capturing market, size, value, and momentum effects.

AB We test for the existence of housing bubbles associated with a failure
   of the transversality condition that requires the present value of
   payments occurring infinitely far in the future to be zero. The most
   prominent such bubble is the classic rational bubble. We study housing
   markets in the United Kingdom and Singapore, where residential property
   ownership takes the form of either leaseholds or freeholds. Leaseholds
   are finite-maturity, pre-paid, and tradeable ownership contracts with
   maturities often exceeding 700 years. Freeholds are infinite-maturity
   ownership contracts. The price difference between leaseholds with
   extremely-long maturities and freeholds reflects the present value of a
   claim to the freehold after leasehold expiry, and is thus a direct
   empirical measure of the transversality condition. We estimate this
   price difference, and find no evidence of failures of the transversality
   condition in housing markets in the U.K. and Singapore, even during
   periods when a sizable bubble was regularly thought to be present.

AB We develop an equilibrium framework that relaxes the standard assumption
   that people have a correctly specified view of their environment. Each
   player is characterized by a (possibly misspecified) subjective model,
   which describes the set of feasible beliefs over payoff-relevant
   consequences as a function of actions. We introduce the notion of a
   Berk-Nash equilibrium: Each player follows a strategy that is optimal
   given her belief, and her belief is restricted to be the best fit among
   the set of beliefs she considers possible. The notion of best fit is
   formalized in terms of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which
   is endogenous and depends on the equilibrium strategy profile. Standard
   solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and self-confirming
   equilibrium constitute special cases where players have correctly
   specified models. We provide a learning foundation for Berk-Nash
   equilibrium by extending and combining results from the statistics
   literature on misspecified learning and the economics literature on
   learning in games.

   bargaining. Rational agents imitate the demands of obstinate behavioral
   types and engage in brinkmanship in the face of uncertainty about the
   deadline's arrival. I also identify how surplus is divided when the
   prior probability of behavioral types is vanishingly small. If
   behavioral types are committed to fixed demands, outcomes converge to
   the Nash bargaining solution regardless of agents' respective
   impatience. If behavioral types can adopt more complex demand
   strategies, outcomes converge to the solution of an alternating offers
   game without behavioral types for the deadline environment.

AB This paper proposes a method for aggregating individual preferences in

   model of Subjective Expected Utility, in which everyone has his/her own
   utility and subjective probability. Disagreement on probabilities among
   individuals gives rise to uncertainty at the societal level, and thus
   society may entertain a set of probabilities rather than only one. We
   assume that social preference admits a Maxmin Expected Utility
   representation. In this context, two Pareto-type conditions are shown to
   be equivalent to social utility being a weighted average of individual
   utilities and the social set of priors containing only weighted averages
   of individual priors. Thus, society respects consensus among
   individuals' beliefs and does not add ambiguity beyond disagreement on
   beliefs. We also deal with the case in which society does not rule out
   any individual belief.

   Life insurers using shadow insurance, which capture half of the market
   share, ceded 25 cents of every dollar insured to shadow reinsurers in
   2012, up from 2 cents in 2002. By relaxing capital requirements, shadow
   insurance could reduce the marginal cost of issuing policies and thereby
   improve retail market efficiency. However, shadow insurance could also
   reduce risk-based capital and increase expected loss for the industry.

AB GDP per capita and household survey means present conflicting pictures
   of the rate of economic development in emerging countries. One of the
   areas in which the national accounts-household surveys debate is key is
   the measurement of developing world poverty. We propose a data-driven
   method to assess the relative quality of GDP per capita and survey means
   by comparing them to the evolution of satellite-recorded nighttime
   lights. Our main assumption, which is robust to a variety of
   specification checks, is that the measurement error in nighttime lights
   is unrelated to the measurement errors in either national accounts or
   survey means. We obtain estimates of weights on national accounts and
   survey means in an optimal proxy for true income; these weights are very
   large for national accounts and very modest for survey means. We
   conclusively reject the null hypothesis that the optimal weight on
   surveys is greater than the optimal weight on national accounts, and we
   generally fail to reject the null hypothesis that the optimal weight on
   surveys is zero. Additionally, we provide evidence that national
   accounts are good indicators of desirable outcomes for the poor (such as
   longer life expectancy, better education and access to safe water), and
   we show that surveys appear to perform worse in developing countries
   that are richer and that are growing faster. Therefore, we interpret our
   results as providing support for estimates of world poverty that are
   based on national accounts.

AB This article examines the historical impact of railroads on the U.S.
   economy, with a focus on quantifying the aggregate impact on the
   agricultural sector in 1890. Expansion of the railroad network may have
   affected all counties directly or indirectly-an econometric challenge
   that arises in many empirical settings. However, the total impact on
   each county is captured by changes in that county's "market access,'' a
   reduced-form expression derived from general equilibrium trade theory.
   We measure counties' market access by constructing a network database of
   railroads and waterways and calculating lowest-cost county-to-county
   freight routes. We estimate that county agricultural land values
   increased substantially with increases in county market access, as the
   railroad network expanded from 1870 to 1890. Removing all railroads in
   1890 is estimated to decrease the total value of U.S. agricultural land
   by 60%, with limited potential for mitigating these losses through
   feasible extensions to the canal network or improvements to country

AB Individual heterogeneity is an important source of variation in demand.
   Allowing for general heterogeneity is needed for correct welfare
   comparisons. We consider general heterogeneous demand where preferences
   and linear budget sets are statistically independent. Only the marginal
   distribution of demand for each price and income is identified from
   cross-section data where only one price and income is observed for each
   individual. Thus, objects that depend on varying price and/or income for
   an individual are not generally identified, including average exact
   consumer surplus. We use bounds on income effects to derive relatively
   simple bounds on the average surplus, including for discrete/continuous
   choice. We also sketch an approach to bounding surplus that does not use
   income effect bounds. We apply the results to gasoline demand. We find
   tight bounds for average surplus in this application, but wider bounds

AB Evidence that social and biological processes are intertwined in
   producing health and human behavior is rapidly accumulating. Using a
   feminist approach, this research explores how gender moderates the
   interaction between biological processes and men's and women's
   behavioral and emotional responses to similar social environments. Using
   data from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism, the
   influence of gender, social integration, and genetic risk on nicotine
   and alcohol dependence is examined. Three-way interaction models reveal
   gender-specific moderation of interactions between genetic risk score
   and social integration. Namely, being currently married and reporting
   positive social psychological integration are predictive of reduced risk
   of nicotine dependence among men with genetic susceptibility to strong
   nicotine cravings in the presence of social cues like stress. In
   contrast, the protective effects of marital status and social
   integration are substantially attenuated and absent, respectively, among
   women with high-risk genotypes. This pattern reflects the dualism (i.e.,
   simultaneous costs and benefits) inherent in social integration for
   women, which may disproportionately affect those with a genetic
   sensitivity to stress. These findings contest the notion of genotype as
   static biological hardwiring that is independent from social and
   cultural systems of gender difference.

AB I review the causes and some of the consequences of the recent decline
   in global real interest rates. Causes include: a higher propensity to
   save associated with a rise in the population share of the high-saving
   middle-aged; a weaker propensity to invest since the 2007-8 financial
   crisis; and portfolio shifts towards safer assets. Consequences include:
   an increased likelihood that policy rates are constrained by the zero
   lower bound, necessitating greater reliance on unconventional monetary
   policies; and an increased risk of financial instability as investors
   seek to generate higher yields.

AB While survey data supports a strong relationship between personality and
   labour market outcomes, the exact mechanisms behind this association
   remain unexplored. We take advantage of a controlled laboratory set-up
   to explore whether this relationship operates through productivity.
   Using a real-effort task, we analyse the impact of the Big Five
   personality traits on performance. We find that more neurotic subjects
   perform worse, and that more conscientious individuals perform better.
   These findings suggest that at least part of the effect of personality
   on labour market outcomes operates through productivity. In addition, we
   find evidence that gender and university major affect this relationship.

AB Prior research on mob violence in the American South has focused on
   lynchings that were successfully completed. Here, the authors explore
   new territory by studying the relationship between state interventions
   in threatened mob violence and industrial expansion in the South. Using
   a newly available inventory of lynching threats, they find that the
   frequency of extraordinary state interventions to avoid mob violence
   between 1880 and 1909 was positively related to the strength of the
   manufacturing sector within counties and negatively related to the
   prevalence of a "Deep South cotton culture." The authors' research
   offers support for the hypothesis that mob violence was incompatible
   with the image of the "New South" and that contradiction motivated state
   authorities to make extraordinary interventions when lynching was
   threatened.

AB This study examines the extent to which strikes diffuse across sectors
   and to what extent this diffusion of strikes can be explained by
   similarities and interdependencies between sectors. For this purpose,
   the authors examine a unique temporally disaggregated and dyadic
   database on strikes in Dutch sectors during the 1995-2007 period. Based
   on a series of discrete-time event-history models, their study clearly
   supports the relevance of intersectoral interdependencies to
   understanding when strikes in one sector are followed by strikes in
   other sectors. Sector-to-sector labor mobility has a significant and
   positive impact on the diffusion of strikes across sectors.

AB This study examined economic disconnection, an extreme case of economic
   exclusion in which families lack both employment and cash assistance,
   among families in the child welfare system. To build hypotheses about
   the intersection of the child welfare system and economic disconnection
   we used a multilevel framework that considers federal policy, local
   practice, and processes within families. We hypothesized that child
   welfare intervention has the potential to be a mechanism of economic
   inclusion or exclusion for vulnerable families, with implications for
   family reunification. We utilized a novel administrative data set
   containing data from three state agencies to construct income histories
   of parents relative to their child's placement in foster care (N =
   15,159 parents). We identified eight trajectories using group-based
   trajectory modeling. About two-thirds of parents experience economic
   disconnection over a three-year period; these families are least likely
   to reunify. Although providing economic resources to families is
   typically beyond the scope of child welfare, efforts to minimize the
   negative impact of child placement on parents' economic connection is
   likely to improve both the economic inclusion of poor families and
   family reunification.

AB Erving Goffman argued that workers in psychiatric wards must enforce
   bureaucratic rules that undermine the image that patients possess a self
   while also engaging in acts of deference that uphold it. Since that
   time, scholars have debated whether other hospital workers now face a
   similar dilemma as their organizations take on the more impersonal
   characteristics of a total institution while also promoting an ideology
   of patient-centered care. Although these writings suggest how care
   providers relate to their work and talk about patient encounters, they
   fail to compare the effects of providers' work orientations on how and
   when they engage in practices that dignify patients. Hence, they shed
   little light on the conditions under which care workers might craft
   patient-centered cultures differently. Building on the insights of
   identity theory and practice theory, we seek to remedy this situation by
   developing an approach for studying and explaining frontline hospital
   workers' diverse styles of caring for the selves of patients. Consistent
   with expectations, we find that hospital nurses who most closely
   identify with their roles and primarily value them for their social
   usefulness (rather than their professional advancement or financial
   rewards) not only perceive more opportunities and engage in more
   tangible acts to affirm patients' sense of selfhood, but they also more
   selectively apply practices to situations. We discuss the implications
   of our results for research on helping professionals, "internal
   activists," humanizing ideologies, and patient-centered care.

AB The socializing power of the prison is routinely discussed as a
   prisonization process in which inmates learn to conform to life in the
   correctional facility. However, the impact that identities socialized in
   the prison may have outside of the institution itself remains an
   under-researched aspect of mass incarceration's collateral consequences.
   In this article, I use ethnographic data collected over 15 months in two
   juvenile justice facilities and interviews with 24 probation youth to
   examine how the identities socialized among Latino prison inmates spill
   over into high-incarceration Latina/o neighborhoods. Strict segregation
   practices in California's prison system categorize and separate Latino
   inmates as coming from either Northern, Southern, or Central California,
   respectively institutionalizing Norteno, Sureno, and Bulldog collective
   identities in the process. I argue that these identities have come to
   frame how criminalized Latina/o youth understand the prison's influence
   on their community. As youth enter the juvenile justice system, they
   encounter facilities that have appropriated the prison's sorting
   practices by categorizing youth and policing the boundaries between
   them. Carceral group identities become instrumental in young people's
   daily lives in this context, mirroring what they have heard from the
   experiences of incarcerated loved ones and confirming where they would
   fit in the prison's social order. This process not only labels youth as
   gang members but instills in them identities and worldviews that
   rationalize their own incarceration, extending the prison's ability to
   categorize people as carceral subjects far beyond the penitentiary
   gates.

AB More than 600,000 prisoners are released from incarceration each year in
   the United States, and most end up returning to metropolitan areas,
   concentrated in resource-deprived neighborhoods. To the extent that
   convicted criminals are distrustful of the criminal justice system, the
   funneling of massive numbers of former prisoners back into select
   neighborhoods likely facilitates the reproduction of legal cynicism in
   those areas. Accordingly, this study tests the effect of prisoner
   reentry on the culture of neighborhoods, particularly with regard to
   legal cynicism. Using two waves of data on the geographic distribution
   of returning prisoners in Chicago from the Illinois Department of
   Corrections combined with data on neighborhood characteristics from the
   U.S. Census, the Chicago Police Department, the Project on Human
   Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, and the Chicago Community Adult
   Health Study, I conduct a cross-lagged analysis of the effect of the
   concentration of returning prisoners on legal cynicism as well as the
   effect of legal cynicism on the geographic distribution of returning
   prisoners. Findings reveal that a dense concentration of returning
   prisoners in a neighborhood facilitates the reproduction of cynical
   views of the law in the neighborhood. The substantial growth in the
   number of releases from prison and the stark concentration of the
   formerly incarcerated in select neighborhoods has detrimental
   consequences for the culture of receiving neighborhoods.

AB Existing research on beliefs about government efforts to lessen poverty
   is limited in two important ways. First, explanations of beliefs about
   antipoverty efforts largely focus on current contexts. By emphasizing
   contemporary contexts, existing research overlooks the potentially
   profound effect of past experiences. Second, most existing research
   relies on cross-sectional data, which limits understandings of within
   person change. In the research presented here, I use both
   cross-sectional and panel data from the General Social Survey to (1)
   examine how past experiences shape an individual's belief about what the
   government should do about poverty, and (2) examine whether beliefs
   about the government's role in helping the poor are sensitive to changes
   in micro and macroeconomic hardship. Drawing on theories related to the
   formative years and event-driven changes, I find that experiences during
   late adolescence, increases in macro-level economic hardship, and
   increases in individual hardship all influence support for government
   efforts to lessen poverty; however, current objective and subjective
   economic position is particularly important. Moreover, I find variation
   in support across different types of government responses to poverty. In
   particular, "welfare" is uniquely unpopular, and support for welfare is
   less responsive to generational experiences or changes in
   individual-level hardship.

AB The Freecycle Network, with its millions of members gifting objects to
   strangers, is a stalwart fixture of the increasingly popular sharing
   economy. Unlike the wildly profitable Airbnb and Uber, the Freecycle
   Network prohibits profit making, or even barter, providing an
   altruism-based alternative to capitalist markets while keeping tons of
   garbage out of landfills. Why do millions of people give through
   Freecycle instead of selling, donating, or throwing away items?
   Utilizing participant observation of two overlapping Freecycle groups
   and a survey of their members, I investigate motivations for giving and
   the social norms that guide it. I find that while members of other
   Internet-based groups have been found to exhibit altruism and
   solidarity, altruism and solidarity in Freecycle appear to be secondary.
   Instead, green-washed convenience takes precedence as members are
   motivated to give in order to declutter their homes in an
   environmentally friendly fashion and in a way that can expiate guilt
   from overconsumption. Embedded in local contexts and governed by
   powerful cultural expectations based on gift exchange and charitable
   donation, Freecycle givers create a set of social structures that
   combine with the organization's focus on the environment to downplay
   altruism and elide inequalities.

AB Why might states adopt policy instruments of one type over another, and
   how does this choice impact the overall portfolio of policy instruments
   a state adopts? To address these questions this article examines
   renewable energy policy instrument adoption by U.S. states and argues
   that states adopt instruments of different types based on their
   state-level economic, political, institutional, and cultural
   characteristics. I test these claims by examining the tax incentive-and
   regulatory mandate-based policy instruments adopted to promote renewable
   energy generation by U.S. states over a 40-year period. Using random
   effects Poisson regression analysis, I find that state affluence,
   environmental movement organization density, and fossil fuel production
   predict the number of policies a state is likely to adopt, while an
   affinity for a neoliberal ideology, U.S. senators environmental voting
   records, and prior policy actions predict the types of policies a state
   adopts. These results reinforce perceptions of economic factors as key
   predictors of renewable energy policy, but also highlight the importance
   of less frequently examined cultural factors for explaining a state's
   portfolio of policies. These analyses offer a robust picture of the
   relationship between tax incentive and regulatory mandates, the two
   types of programmatic approaches that have dominated many policy domains
   in the United States over the past 40 years.

AB Existing evidence of educational effects on intergenerational mobility
   is associational. This study employs early compulsory schooling laws to
   approach a causal estimate of the relationship between education and
   mobility in the context of a large-scale policy change. Using IPUMS
   Linked Representative Samples (linked census data), regression
   discontinuity models exploit state differences in the timing of
   compulsory schooling laws to estimate an intent-to-treat effect on
   intergenerational occupational mobility among white males. Despite
   increasing equality of attendance, results reveal that compulsory laws
   initially reduced relative mobility for the first few cohorts affected
   by the laws. Among later cohorts, who were required to attend the
   maximum years of school, mobility was similar to prelaw levels. School
   funding and other data suggest that structural lag could explain this
   nonlinear relationship. It seems, therefore, that educational expansion
   inadvertently reduced mobility through institutional inertia rather than
   elite efforts to maintain advantage.

   and self-image that immigrants' evolving knowledge of and participation
   in the legalization process facilitate. Relying on close to 200
   interviews with immigrants from several national origin groups in Los
   Angeles and Phoenix, the authors identify transformations that
   individuals enact in their intimate and in their civic lives as they
   come in contact with U.S. immigration law en route to and as a result of
   regularization. Findings illustrate the power of the state to control
   individuals' activities and mind-sets in ways that are not explicitly
   formal or bureaucratic. The barriers the state creates, which push
   immigrants to the legal margins, together with anti-immigrant hostility,
   create conditions under which immigrants are likely to undertake
   transformative, lasting changes in their lives. These transformations
   reify notions of the deserving immigrant vis-a-vis the law, alter the
   legalization process for the immigrant population at large, and,
   ultimately, shape integration dynamics.

AB Upon entry into host cells, intracellular bacterial pathogens establish
   a variety of replicative niches. Although some remodel phagosomes,
   others rapidly escape into the cytosol of infected cells. Little is
   currently known regarding how professional intracytoplasmic pathogens,
   including Shigella, mediate phagosomal escape. Shigella, like many other
   Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, uses a type III secretion system to
   deliver multiple proteins, referred to as effectors, into host cells.
   Here, using an innovative reductionist-based approach, we demonstrate
   that the introduction of a functional Shigella type III secretion
   system, but none of its effectors, into a laboratory strain of
   Escherichia coli is sufficient to promote the efficient vacuole lysis
   and escape of themodified bacteria into the cytosol of epithelial cells.
   This establishes for the first time, to our knowledge, a direct
   physiologic role for the Shigella type III secretion apparatus (T3SA) in
   mediating phagosomal escape. Furthermore, although protein components of
   the T3SA share a moderate degree of structural and functional
   conservation across bacterial species, we show that vacuole lysis is not
   a common feature of T3SA, as an effectorless strain of Yersinia remains
   confined to phagosomes. Additionally, by exploiting the functional
   interchangeability of the translocator components of the T3SA of
   Shigella, Salmonella, and Chromobacterium, we demonstrate that a single
   protein component of the T3SA translocon-Shigella IpaC, Salmonella SipC,
   or Chromobacterium CipC-determines the fate of intracellular pathogens
   within both epithelial cells and macrophages. Thus, these findings have
   identified a likely paradigm by which the replicative niche of many
   intracellular bacterial pathogens is established.

AB Millions of workers are employed in positions that deviate from the
   full-time, standard employment relationship or work in jobs that are
   mismatched with their skills, education, or experience. Yet, little is
   known about how employers evaluate workers who have experienced these
   employment arrangements, limiting our knowledge about how part-time
   work, temporary agency employment, and skills underutilization affect
   workers' labor market opportunities. Drawing on original field and
   survey experiment data, I examine three questions: (1) What are the
   consequences of having a nonstandard or mismatched employment history
   for workers' labor market opportunities? (2) Are the effects of
   nonstandard or mismatched employment histories different for men and
   women? and (3) What are the mechanisms linking nonstandard or mismatched
   employment histories to labor market outcomes? The field experiment
   shows that skills underutilization is as scarring for workers as a year
   of unemployment, but that there are limited penalties for workers with
   histories of temporary agency employment. Additionally, although men are
   penalized for part-time employment histories, women face no penalty for
   part-time work. The survey experiment reveals that employers'
   perceptions of workers' competence and commitment mediate these effects.
   These findings shed light on the consequences of changing employment
   relations for the distribution of labor market opportunities in the new
   economy.

AB This article investigates the relationship between job mobility and wage
   mobility for salaried workers at the beginning of the employment career
   in eight European countries. While job-to-job mobility is associated
   with positive rewards, there are competing theories for job mobility via
   unemployment. Search and matching models predict that an unemployment
   phase might result in positive rewards. In contrast, signalling and
   human capital theories predict a negative impact of unemployment on
   future wages. Our results indicate that the validity of theoretical
   concepts is largely dependent on the institutional context. Job mobility
   via unemployment yields high rewards for job movers in Ireland and the
   United Kingdom and to a lesser degree in Southern Europe, but negative
   outcomes in Austria and Germany. In contrast, job-to-job mobility
   rewards job movers with positive outcomes in all countries, though to a
   lesser extent in southern European countries.
   Search and matching models are therefore more appropriate for predicting
   outcomes in countries of liberal regime, while signalling and human
   capital models yield better predictions in countries with stricter
   employment legislation and tighter occupational boundaries. In southern
   European countries, the insider-outsider fragmentation of the labour
   market impairs predictive power of both theories.

AB The within-country and between-country heterogeneity of populations has
   been largely studied apart from each other. This article analyses
   simultaneously these two parts of value heterogeneity of populations
   using a typological approach. Using data from the European Social
   Survey, populations of 29 European countries are classified based on
   their values that were measured with Schwartz's Portrait Values
   Questionnaire. Latent class analysis resulted in five European value
   classes. All the countries studied are internally diverse in their value
   class composition, and most of them have a non-zero probability to have
   members of all the five value classes. Nordic and Western European
   countries surpass Mediterranean and Post-Communist Europe in the
   probability of a class that combines the strongest preferences for
   Openness over Conservation and for Self-Transcendence over
   Self-Enhancement. It is concluded that a typological approach provides a
   new look at within- and between-country value differences, making
   empirical comparisons holistic and more parsimonious.

AB Almost all Western societies are characterized by social and ethnic
   inequalities in educational attainment. There is growing awareness of
   policymakers about the problems arising from such disparities,
   accompanied by attempts to reduce these inequalities by adequate
   educational policies. One strategy is to affect the parental educational
   decision-making process by manipulating students' and parents' freedom
   of choice at different transitions during the educational career and
   thereby affecting the possibility of selective educational decisions.
   However, it is so far unclear whether such educational policies work and
   if so, whether they are beneficial for reducing social and ethnic
   inequalities likewise. By using unique data from a quasi-experimental
   design comparing German- and Turkish-origin students at the end of
   primary school in Germany, I show that institutional settings reducing
   parents' leeway to decide about the school tracks after primary school
   irrespective of prior achievement diminish social inequalities at the
   transition to upper secondary education. However, the relative
   disadvantage for Turkish-origin students and therefore ethnic
   inequalities increase in a more-meritocratic setting with less parental
   freedom of choice, especially for immigrant children with poorly
   educated parents. The study demonstrates that neglecting group-specific
   educational decision-making processes may thwart meaningful educational
   policies.

AB Using European Union Labour Force Survey data from 1998 to 2004, this
   research explores how the decrease in the positional value of education
   associated with educational expansion has affected occupational returns
   to education in Spain. The positional value of education is measured by
   taking the percentage of labour market entrants with at least the same
   level of education as the respondent for every year of entry into the
   labour market since 1959. We control for the effects of the economic
   cycle, of economic sectors, and of the different educational reforms
   that have affected nine successive cohorts of labour market entrants.
   Our analysis reveals, first, that a higher percentage of entrants with
   at least the same credential as the respondent is associated with lower
   occupational prestige; second, we find that this loss of occupational
   prestige is higher for general than for technical education, supporting
   the hypothesis that technical fields of education transmit a clearer
   signal of workers' skills to employers. The exception is health and
   welfare fields in higher education. The possibility that educational or
   occupational segregation by gender explains the relative occupational
   loss in this particular field is not supported by our findings.

AB The present article suggests that if we wish to learn more about the
   relationship between class origin and educational outcomes, we need to
   consider the activities of the young people concerned. The article seeks
   to investigate whether, and to what degree, youth activities are
   important links between class origin and school grades. Using a unique
   combination of survey data from young people and their parents together
   with registry data, activities are investigated in terms of cultural
   activities, civic engagement, sports, television viewing, and homework.
   The empirical analysis is based on structural equation modelling and
   reveals that some youth activities mediate parts of the effect of class
   origin on school grades. Of the investigated activities, it is foremost
   cultural activities that are related to both class origin and school
   grades. When youth activities are investigated, the difference in school
   grades between young people of an unskilled blue-collar origin and
   upper-white-collar origin is reduced almost by one half. However, the
   analysis also reveals that class origin continues to have a significant
   bearing on school grades even when these activities have been taken into
   account.

AB Previous studies have shown that overeducation is inferior to adequate
   employment. For example, overeducated workers have lower earnings,
   participate less often in continuing education and training, and are
   less satisfied with their jobs. This article changes perspectives by
   asking whether it is better for the unemployed to take up a job for
   which they are overeducated or to remain unemployed and continue the
   search for adequate employment. Theoretically, we rely on the
   established confrontation of the stepping-stone and trap hypotheses,
   which make opposing predictions in terms of long-term employment chances
   and job quality. Using the German Socio-Economic Panel (1984-2012) and
   applying a dynamic propensity score matching approach, the analyses
   reveal an interesting trade-off. Although an overeducated re-entry
   increases the long-term employment chances persistently, it also implies
   strong lock-in effects into overeducation for up to 5 years after
   re-employment. In sum, the results support the stepping-stone hypothesis
   in terms of future employment chances, but also highlight non-negligible
   risks of remaining trapped in a job that is below one's level of
   educational qualification.

AB In the wake of European border removal, scholars have been puzzled by
   the slow and limited Europeanization of everyday life. Only a small
   group of Europeans with high socio-economic status regularly interact
   across borders. However, we do not know well how these socio-economic
   differences come about, and by which country-level characteristics they
   are influenced. This article asks whether social inequalities of
   transnational interactions exist already among secondary schoolchildren,
   and which country-level factors promote transnational interactions and
   moderate their stratification. Relying on a multi-level analysis of the
   International Civics and Citizenship Study in 21 European states in
   2009, it shows that parental socio-economic status influences
   transnational interactions of their offspring in almost all countries
   analysed. Second, economic differences also matter across countries,
   youth living in wealthier economies being more transnational. At the
   same time, economic prosperity serves as an 'elevator' that decreases
   the socio-economic differences in transnational behaviour.

AB This study uses hybrid effects regressions with the German
   Socio-Economic Panel to compare differences in happiness between Germans
   during times of high and low income inequality. It shows that Germans
   interviewed during times of persistently low inequality were no more
   satisfied with their lives than Germans during times of persistently
   high inequality. However, the article also uses within effects to show
   that the same individual is less satisfied with life in those years
   where inequality is higher than during a typical year. This non-negative
   between-person influence of inequality on life satisfaction, coupled
   with the negative within-person effect of inequality on life
   satisfaction, indicates that short-term increases in inequality decrease
   life satisfaction, but long-run levels of inequality do not. Part of the
   negative effect of inequality on life satisfaction exists because
   increased media attention to inequality seems to decrease life
   satisfaction. This indicates that perceptions of above-average
   inequality are damaging to life satisfaction, but long-run levels of
   inequality are not. The results from this study therefore indicate that
   the existing literature may find ambiguous effects of inequality on life
   satisfaction because people get used to long-run inequality, so that
   short-run increases in inequality, rather than long-run levels of
   inequality, make people unsatisfied with life. This may explain why
   populations of countries with persistently high inequality are as
   satisfied with life as populations of more equal countries, even though
   the same individual is less satisfied with life in those years where
   inequality is above-average.

AB To analyze the impact of labor market competition on the structure of
   compensation, we embed multitasking and screening within a Hotelling
   framework. Competition for talent leads to an escalation of performance
   pay, shifting effort away from long-term investments, risk management,
   and cooperation. Efficiency losses can exceed those from a single
   principal, who dulls incentives to extract rents. As competition
   intensifies, monopsonistic underincentivization of low-skill agents
   first decreases and then gives way to growing overincentivization of
   high-skill ones. Aggregate welfare is thus hill-shaped, while inequality
   tends to rise monotonically. Bonus caps can help restore balance in
   incentives but may generate other distortions.

   health, while on the other hand, retirement can represent a relief from
   demanding work. Conditional change ordered logistic analyses show that
   indeed, retirement is beneficial for health, but this is largely

   that vary in typicality. This allows consideration of orientations on
   two dimensions of cultural preference: variety and typicality. We
   propose a novel analytic framework to map consumption behavior in these
   two dimensions. We argue that one audience type, those who value variety

AB While group differences in violence have long been a key focus of
   sociological inquiry, we know comparatively little about the trends in
   criminal violence for whites, blacks, and Hispanics in recent decades.
   Combining geocoded death records with multiple data sources to capture
   the socioeconomic, demographic, and legal context of 131 of the largest
   metropolitan areas in the United States, this article examines the
   trends in racial/ethnic inequality in homicide rates since 1990. In
   addition to exploring long-established explanations (e.g.,
   disadvantage), we also investigate how three of the most significant
   societal changes over the past 20 years, namely, rapid immigration, mass
   incarceration, and rising wealth inequality affect racial/ethnic
   homicide gaps. Across all three comparisonswhite-black, white-Hispanic,
   and black-Hispanicwe find considerable convergence in homicide rates
   over the past two decades. Consistent with expectations, structural
   disadvantage is one of the strongest predictors of levels and changes in
   racial/ethnic violence disparities. In contrast to predictions based on
   strain theory, racial/ethnic wealth inequality has not increased
   disparities in homicide. Immigration, on the other hand, appears to be
   associated with declining white-black homicide differences. Consistent
   with an incapacitation/deterrence perspective, greater racial/ethnic
   incarceration disparities are associated with smaller racial/ethnic gaps
   in homicide.

   to account for neighborhood variation in Chicago homicidesto explain
   Arab Sunni victimization and insurgent attacks during the U.S.
   post-invasion occupation of Iraq. Legal cynicism theory has an
   unrecognized power to explain collective and interpersonal violence in
   international as well as U.S. settings. We expand on how double and
   linked roles of state and non-state actors can be used to analyze
   violence against Arab Sunni civilians. Arab Sunnis responded to reports
   of unnecessary violent attacks by U.S./Coalition soldiers with a legally
   cynical framing of the U.S./Coalition-led invasion and occupation, the
   new Shia-dominated Iraqi state, and its military and police. A
   post-invasion frame amplification of beliefs about state-based
   illegitimacy, unresponsiveness, and insecurity made it not only possible
   but predictable that Arab Sunni insurgent attacks would continue against
   U.S./Coalition forces and transfer to Shia-dominated Iraqi government
   forces. Violence in Iraq persisted despite U.S. surge efforts to end the
   Arab Sunni insurgency.

AB Conventional research in organizational theory highlights the role of
   board interlocks in facilitating business collective action. In this
   article, I propose that business collective action affects the
   evolutionary path of interlock networks. In particular, large market
   players' response after a collective action to the classic problem of
   the exploitation of the great by the small provides a mechanism for
   interlocks to evolve. Through studying the two types of collective
   action that banks organized during the Panic of 1907, I find that the
   experience of issuing currency substitutes, a course of collective
   action that needed to mobilize community support, made bankers more
   aware of their responsibility for community welfare. In the post-crisis
   period, bankers were thus more supportive of the market stabilization
   strategy of assisting small banks. In contrast, the experience of
   organizing mutual lending, a course of collective action that
   highlighted the power of businesses independent of the communities in
   which they were located, led bankers to focus more on their sectional
   interest and favor the market stabilization strategy of eliminating
   small banks. These different attitudes toward small banks affected the
   evolution of the interlock networks between large and small banks.

AB Community reactions against organizations can be driven by negative
   information spread through a diffusion process that is distinct from the
   diffusion of organizational practices. Bank panics offer a classic
   example of selective diffusion of negative information. Bank panics
   involve widespread bank runs, although a low proportion of banks
   experience a run. We develop theory on how organizational similarity,
   community similarity, and network proximity create selective diffusion
   paths for resistance against organizations. Using data from the largest
   customer-driven bank panic in the United States, we find significant
   effects of organizational and community similarity on the diffusion of
   bank runs. Runs on banks are more likely to diffuse across communities
   with similar ethnicities, national origins, religion, and wealth, and
   across banks that are structurally equivalent or have the same
   organizational form. We also find stronger influence from runs that are
   spatially proximate and in the same state.

   This article proposes a framework to ascertain the relative magnitude of

   based on pairwise comparisons of actual and counterfactual seat
   allocation outcomes. It uses the design to analyze a nationwide
   municipal electoral reform in Norway, which changed the seat allocation

AB Parties are not unitary actors, and legislators within the same party
   may have divergent interests, which complicates the understanding of
   parties' motivations and behaviour. This article argues that holding a
   ministerial portfolio confers an electoral advantage, and so, in
   contrast to their co-partisans, politicians who are ministers
   simultaneously maximize policy, office and votes. New data on Irish
   elections over a thirty-year period show that ministers are insulated
   from the electoral cost of governing compared with their co-partisans.
   Differentiating between ministers and their co-partisans helps to
   resolve the puzzle of political parties' choosing to enter government
   despite the evident electoral costs they will encounter. Moreover,
   previously overlooked electoral benefits of ministerial office help
   explain their desirability, and thus their ability to incentivize
   legislative behaviour in parliamentary regimes.

   have become the dominant mode of regulating access to political power.
   With cross-national data on electoral violence in Sub-Saharan African
   elections between 1990 and 2010, this article develops and tests a
   theory that links the use of violent electoral tactics to the high
   stakes put in place by majoritarian electoral institutions. It is found
   that electoral violence is more likely in countries that employ
   majoritarian voting rules and elect fewer legislators from each
   district. Majoritarian institutions are, as predicted by theory,
   particularly likely to provoke violence where large ethno-political
   groups are excluded from power and significant economic inequalities
   exist.

AB This article addresses two aspects of social network influence on

   party systems as institutional contexts and the relationship between
   social pressure and information sharing as mechanisms of influence. It
   argues that in the cleavage-based multiparty systems of Western Europe,
   discussant influence at elections occurs in two stages. First,
   discussants place social pressure on voters to opt for parties from the
   same ideological camp. Secondly, by providing information, discussants
   influence which parties voters eventually choose out of these restricted
   'consideration sets'. The study tests these assumptions using a panel
   survey conducted at the 2009 German federal election. The first
   proposition is clearly confirmed, and the evidence supports the second
   proposition, although less unequivocally.

AB Financial activity has become increasingly important in affluent
   economies in recent decades. Because this 'financialization' distributes
   costs and benefits unevenly across groups, politics and policy likely
   affect the process. Therefore, this article discusses how changes in the
   power of organizations representing the 'winners' and 'losers' of
   financialization affect its pace. An analysis of the United States from
   1949-2005, shows that when unions are stronger, and when the Democratic
   Party is in power and is more reliant on the support of working-class
   voters, financialization is slower. In contrast, when the financial
   industry is more highly mobilized into politics, financialization is
   faster. The study also finds that financial deregulation was one policy
   translating the political power of these actors into economic outcomes.

AB Legal scholars frequently advocate institutional reforms to modernize

   reforms also offer an opportunity for politicians to reshuffle the high
   courts. The negative consequences of constitutional change for judicial
   stability are explored using an original database of Supreme Court and
   Constitutional Tribunal members in eighteen Latin American countries
   between 1904 and 2010. Because unobserved factors potentially explain
   constitutional replacement as well as judicial turnover, a two-stage
   event-history model has been employed. The analysis integrates two
   literatures, studies of constitution-making and studies of judicial
   politics. The results show that constitutional change is a significant
   cause of judicial instability and court manipulation, even after
   potential endogeneity has been taken into account.

   referendum decision to ban any future construction of Islamic minarets.
   It examines two grounds for opposition: the human right to freedom of
   religion, and the liberal principle of equal treatment of cultures. It
   argues that the human right is too limited, and that the equal treatment
   principle can be trumped by considerations of national identity when
   public space is involved. Nevertheless, the content of that identity and
   its public expression must remain open to democratic deliberation, and
   the Swiss decision can be faulted on those grounds.

   presents models of the frequently adopted rules for constitutional
   revision (for example, qualified majorities in one or two chambers,
   referendums) and demonstrates that, if longer constitutions are more
   frequently revised, it is because they must impose actual harm on
   overwhelming majorities. In trying to explain this finding, the article
   demonstrates that longer constitutions tend to contain more substantive
   restrictions. Countries with longer constitutions also tend to have
   lower levels of GDP per capita and higher corruption. Finally, the
   negative effect of constitutional length on GDP per capita is shown to
   persist even if corruption is controlled for.

   investigating cross-sectional as well as longitudinal effects in the
   case of Germany, using a combination of individual- and regional-level
   data for several time points from 1994 to 2010. Our results suggest that
   native-born populations become more reluctant to support welfare
   programs when the proportion of foreigners at the regional level
   increases. This effect is particularly strong in the initial phase of
   immigration, and it is further moderated by the economic context: the
   higher the unemployment rate, the more negative is the effect of
   foreigners on natives' attitude toward providing welfare.

AB Since the 1980s, leading U.S. firms have announced massive downsizing
   plans in the name of maximizing shareholder value, but some observers
   are skeptical about how serious firms are in implementing these plans.
   Building on political theories of corporate governance, I examine how
   conflicts of interest and alignment among investors, workers, and top
   managers affect the implementation of announced downsizing plans. Using
   a sample of 656 companies between 1984 and 2005, I demonstrate the
   contrasting influences of these three stakeholder groups on two
   different implementation outcomestotal and managerial downsizing. The
   influence of investors who pursue profit maximization facilitates both,
   whereas the influence of workers who seek job security impedes the
   former but facilitates the latter. The power of top managers who attempt
   to retain managerial autonomy impedes managerial downsizing, but
   governance mechanisms that align their interests with investor interests
   facilitate total downsizing. By teasing out the influences of competing
   interest groups, this article contributes to a political theory of
   organizational policy implementation. By unpacking the implementation of
   downsizing and its potentially unequal effects on different groups of
   workers, this article also contributes to the economic sociology of
   downsizing and the broader stratification literature on economic
   inequality and job insecurity.

   parties. While mainstream parties emphasize anti-immigrant positions in
   response to radical right success, green party success will have the
   opposite effect for environmental issues. Since green parties constitute
   issue owners, their success will make established parties de-emphasize
   the environment. Analyzing time-series cross-section data for sixteen
   Western European countries from 1980 to 2011, this article empirically
   establishes that green and radical right parties differ in their effect
   on mainstream party behavior and that their impact depends on the

   lower-poverty neighborhood when young (before age 13) increases college
   attendance and earnings and reduces single parenthood rates. Moving as
   an adolescent has slightly negative impacts, perhaps because of
   disruption effects. The decline in the gains from moving with the age

   investors believe that picking an investment option is tedious as we
   have a wide variety of stocks from various sectors which witness sharp
   price movements resulting in volatility. The National Stock Exchange of
   India has formed several sectoral indices in order to provide a rational
   outlook to investors on the performance of various sectors. All these
   sectoral indices were created with high quality stocks from the
   respective sectors, which is extremely useful in identifying profitable
   investment opportunities for investors. This study is intended to form
   some investment strategies based on sectoral performance of stocks.
   Contrarian and momentum strategies are two major investment strategies
   widely debated by investment strategists across the world. All sectoral
   indices provided by NSE have been considered for the study. The period
   of study is between April 2009 and March 2015. The sectoral indices were
   studied on the notion that the test result will give a clear cut picture
   on the investment strategies to be adopted with stocks of various
   sectors. Results of the study confirm that short term contrarian effect
   exists in Metals, Auto, Banking and Energy sectors. So the investors
   should employ adequate care while investing with such sectors for the
   short term. In case of long term investments, due care should be
   employed while selecting stocks from the media sector. In addition to
   these observations, the test results produced evidence on the
   subsistence of momentum effect in the Indian stock market. Here buy
   'past winners' and sell 'past losers' can generate extra profit.

AB Why does the relationship between income and partisanship vary across
   U.S. regions? Some answers to this question have focused on economic
   context (in poorer environments, economics is more salient), whereas
   others have focused on racial context (in racially diverse areas, richer
   voters oppose the party favoring redistribution). Using 73 million
   geocoded registration records and 185,000 geocoded precinct returns, we
   examine income-based voting across local areas. We show that the
   political geography of income-based voting is inextricably tied to
   racial context, and only marginally explained by economic context.
   Within homogeneously nonblack localities, contextual income has minimal
   bearing on the income-party relationship. The correlation between income
   and partisanship is strong in heavily black areas of the Old South and
   other areas with a history of racialized poverty, but weaker elsewhere,
   including in urbanized areas of the South. The results demonstrate that
   the geography of income-based voting is inseparable from racial context.

AB Since 9/11, several states have initiated military conflicts in the name
   of fighting terrorism. However, studies indicate that the costs of
   terrorism are insignificant compared to the damage created by war. This
   raises the question: Why do states initiate costly wars when the risk
   posed by terrorism appears marginal? This study presents two
   explanations. First, we argue that while terrorists frequently fail to
   achieve their strategic objectives, terrorists can accomplish tactical
   objectives and may transition to insurgencies by seizing control of
   pockets of territory. States may respond by initiating preventive wars
   to stop terrorists from consolidating control over their strategically
   valuable territories (e.g., resource-rich areas). Second, rival states
   may opportunistically exploit terrorist violence by declaring that the
   government is a weak state. This allows rivals to seize portions of the
   government's territory under the cover of fighting terror. We test these
   hypotheses using post-Cold War African dyads from 1990 to 2006.

AB Recent research has cast doubt on the potential for various electoral
   reforms to increase voter turnout. In this article, we examine the
   effectiveness of preregistration laws, which allow young citizens to
   register before being eligible to vote. We use two empirical approaches
   to evaluate the impact of preregistration on youth turnout. First, we
   implement difference-in-difference and lag models to bracket the causal
   effect of preregistration implementation using the 2000-2012 Current
   Population Survey. Second, focusing on the state of Florida, we leverage
   a discontinuity based on date of birth to estimate the effect of
   increased preregistration exposure on the turnout of young registrants.
   In both approaches, we find preregistration increases voter turnout,
   with equal effectiveness for various subgroups in the electorate. More
   broadly, observed patterns suggest that campaign context and supporting
   institutions may help to determine when and if electoral reforms are
   effective.

AB A growing body of research suggests that authoritarian regimes are
   responsive to societal actors, but our understanding of the sources of
   authoritarian responsiveness remains limited because of the challenges
   of measurement and causal identification. By conducting an online field
   experiment among 2,103 Chinese counties, we examine factors that affect
   officials' incentives to respond to citizens in an authoritarian
   context. At baseline, we find that approximately one-third of county
   governments respond to citizen demands expressed online. Threats of
   collective action and threats of tattling to upper levels of government
   cause county governments to be considerably more responsive, whereas
   identifying as loyal, long-standing members of the Chinese Communist
   Party does not increase responsiveness. Moreover, we find that threats
   of collective action make local officials more publicly responsive.
   Together, these results demonstrate that top-down mechanisms of
   oversight as well as bottom-up societal pressures are possible sources
   of authoritarian responsiveness.

AB We investigate institutional explanations for Congress's choice to

   divided party government, which fuels legislative-executive conflict
   over control of the bureaucracy, motivates Congress to fragment
   implementation power as a strategy to enhance its control over
   implementation. We develop a novel measure of fragmentation in policy
   implementation, collect data on it over the period 1947-2008, and test
   hypotheses linking separation-of-powers structures to legislative design
   of fragmented implementation power. We find that divided party
   government is powerfully associated with fragmentation in policy
   implementation, and that this association contributed to the long-run
   growth of fragmentation in the postwar United States. We further find
   that legislative coalitions are more likely to fragment implementation
   power in the face of greater uncertainty about remaining in the

AB Why do some countries indulge in financial repression, harming economic
   development in the process, whereas others promote financial
   development? Three main explanations have been put forth. Market
   failures, due to information asymmetries, mean that credit is rationed
   even when lenders could potentially benefit from making loans readily
   available. Political failures, due to state capture, mean that credit
   will be rationed as a way of generating rents for politically powerful
   financial incumbents. The state might, however, have its own fiscal
   reasons for politicizing the supply and price of credit, since financial
   repression provides easy-to-collect revenues. I draw on the third
   approach to argue that the state's fiscal imperative is usually the
   primary reason behind financial repression, and even when private actors
   benefit, they are subordinate to this concern. A dynamic panel analysis
   that exploits instrumental variables and a case study of Mexico adduce
   strong empirical support for my fiscal transaction cost theory.

AB Why is the difference in redistribution preferences between the rich and

   argue that it has a lot to do with the rich and very little to do with
   the poor. We contend that while there is a general relative income
   effect on redistribution preferences, the preferences of the rich are
   highly dependent on the macrolevel of inequality. The reason for this
   effect is not related to immediate tax and transfer considerations but
   to a negative externality of inequality: crime. We will show that the
   rich in more unequal regions in Western Europe are more supportive of
   redistribution than the rich in more equal regions because of their
   concern with crime. In making these distinctions between the poor and
   the rich, the arguments in this article challenge some influential
   approaches to the politics of inequality.

   formal theory of signaling in the judicial hierarchy, we examine the
   role of whistleblowing dissents in triggering en banc review of
   three-judge panels by full circuits of the Courts of Appeals. The theory
   generates predictions about how dissent interacts with judicial
   preferences to influence circuits' review and reversal decisions, which
   we test using original and existing data. First, we show that judges who
   dissent counter to their preferences are more likely to see their
   dissents lead to review and reversal. Second, we show that dissents are
   most influential when the likelihood of non-compliance by a three-judge
   panel is highest. Our results underscore the importance of dissent in
   the judicial hierarchy and illustrate how judicial whistleblowers can
   help appellate courts target the most important cases for review.

AB Recently, offspring sex has been widely used as a natural experiment and
   argued to induce changes in political orientation among parents.
   However, prior results have been contradictory: in the UK, researchers
   found that having daughters led to parents favoring left-wing political
   parties and to holding more liberal views on family/gender roles,
   whereas in the United States scholars found that daughters were
   associated with more Republican (rightist) party identification and more
   conservative views on teen sexuality. We propose and examine three
   plausible explanations to account for these puzzling results using data
   from the General Social Survey and the European Social Survey;
   contextual (period/country) differences, heterogeneous treatment
   effects, and publication bias. In an analysis of thirty-six countries,
   we obtain null effects of the sex of the first child on party
   identification as well as on political ideology while ruling out country
   heterogeneity. Further, we observe no evidence of other heterogeneous
   treatment effects based on the analysis of Bayesian Additive Regression
   Tree models. As a corrective to the source of publication bias, we here
   add comprehensive null findings to the polarized canon of significant
   results.

AB Studies of clientelism typically assume that political machines
   distribute rewards to persuade or mobilize the existing electorate. We
   argue that rewards not only influence actions of the electorate, but can
   also shape its composition. Across the world, machines employ voter
   buying to import outsiders into their districts. Voter buying
   demonstrates how clientelism can underpin electoral fraud, and it offers
   an explanation of why machines deliver rewards when they cannot monitor
   vote choices. Our analyses suggest that voter buying dramatically
   influences municipal elections in Brazil. A regression discontinuity
   design suggests that voter auditswhich undermined voter buyingdecreased
   the electorate by 12 percentage points and reduced the likelihood of
   mayoral reelection by 18 percentage points. Consistent with voter
   buying, these effects are significantly greater in municipalities with
   large voter inflows, and where neighboring municipalities had large
   voter outflows. Findings are robust to an alternative research design

AB In this article the authors undertake a systematic analysis of why

   United States. They argue theoretically that border enforcement. emerged
   as a policy response to a moral panic about the perceived threat of
   Latino immigration to the United States propounded by self interested
   bureaucrats, politicians, and pundits who sought to mobilize political
   and material resources for their own benefit. The end result was a
   self-perpetuating cycle of rising enforcement and increased
   apprehensions that resulted in the militarization of the border in a way
   that was disconnected from the actual size of the undocumented flow.
   Using an instrumental variable approach, the authors show how border
   militarization affected the behavior of unauthorized migrants and border
   outcomes to transform undocumented Mexican migration from a circular
   flow of male workers going to three states into an 11 million person

   transgovernmental networks, and private transnational regulatory
   organizations (PTROs)-have expanded rapidly, while the growth of formal
   intergovernmental organizations has slowed. Organizational ecology
   provides an insightful framework for understanding these changing
   patterns of growth. Organizational ecology is primarily a structural
   theory, emphasizing the influence of institutional environments,
   especially their organizational density and resource availability, on
   organizational behavior and viability. To demonstrate the explanatory
   value of organizational ecology, we analyze the proliferation of PTROs
   compared with the relative stasis of intergovernmental organizations
   (IGOs). Continued growth of IGOs is constrained by crowding in their
   dense institutional environment, but PTROs benefit from organizational
   flexibility and low entry costs, which allow them to enter "niches" with
   limited resource competition. We probe the plausibility of our analysis

AB By the end of the twentieth century, a scholarly consensus emerged
   around the idea that oil fuels authoritarianism and slow growth. The
   natural abundance once thought to be a blessing was unconditionally, and
   then later only conditionally, a curse for political and economic
   development. We re-examine the relationship between oil wealth and
   political regimes, challenging the conventional wisdom that such natural
   resource rents lead to authoritarian outcomes. We contend that most
   efforts to examine the causal linkages between natural resource
   abundance and political regime have been complicated by the likelihood
   that both democracy and oil revenue are endogenous to the
   industrialization processes itself, particularly in its developmentalist
   form. Our quantitative results, based on an analysis of global data from
   1970 to 2006, show that both resource endogeneity and several mechanisms
   of intraregional regime diffusion are powerful determinants of
   democratic outcomes. Qualitative evidence from the history of
   industrialization in Latin America yields support for our proposed
   causal claim. Oil wealth is not necessarily a curse and may even be a
   blessing with respect to democratic development.

AB What drives leaders' decisions about whether to continue or end an
   ongoing war? The private information explanation for war holds that
   leaders fight because they believe that doing so will advance national
   interests, and they settle hostilities when new information reduces
   their optimism about the possibility of long-term success. Yet
   significant theoretical disagreement exists about both the extent to
   which and the manner in which new information, especially battlefield
   information, promotes settlement. This article unpacks the logic of the
   informational mechanism, arguing that settlement will be more likely
   when there has been more extensive fighting and that countries are more
   likely to make concessions to end wars when battlefield results have
   deteriorated; short-term spikes in war intensity by contrast do not
   promote settlement. Moreover, building on work on leadership turnover
   and settlement, I show that leader replacement is sometimes part of the
   information-updating process, especially in autocracies: new leaders
   without political ties to the person in power at the start of the war
   are more likely both to come to power when war is going poorly and to
   end wars once in office. Tests of these arguments make use of new
   participant-level data on the timing of battle deaths for all Correlates
   of War interstate wars, which allows me to examine the effects of
   changing battlefield developments across a wide range of cases in a
   manner that was previously impossible.

AB The cross-border movement of people, goods, and information frequently
   results in legal disputes that come under the jurisdiction of multiple
   states. The principle of deference-acceptance of another state's
   exercise of legal authority-is one mechanism to manage such
   jurisdictional conflicts. Despite the importance of deference in
   international law and cooperation, little is known about the causes of
   variation in its use. In this article, we develop a theory of deference
   that focuses on the role that domestic institutions and norms play in
   ensuring procedural and substantive fairness. We test this theory in an
   original data set concerning accession practices in the Hague Convention
   on International Child Abduction. Our findings offer considerable
   support for the idea that states evaluate partners on the likelihood
   that they can offer a fair legal process. Exploring empirically the
   efforts against parental child abduction, we offer a nuanced account of
   the link between domestic institutions and norms and international
   cooperation. This account suggests that greater attention should be paid
   to the use of deference as a mechanism to manage the conflicts posed by

AB What drives autocrats to default on their sovereign debt? This article
   develops the first theory of sovereign debt default in autocracies that
   explicitly investigates survival incentives of political actors in
   nondemocracies. Self-interested elites, fearful of threats to their
   tenure because of urban unrest, may be willing to endure the long-term
   borrowing costs that defaulting creates rather than risk the short-term
   survival costs of removing cheap food policies for urban consumers. I
   test my main claims that both urbanization and food imports should be
   associated with greater likelihood of autocratic default using panel
   data covering forty-three countries over fifty years, finding that
   autocracies that are more reliant on imported food and that are more
   urbanized are significantly more likely to be in default on their
   external sovereign debt. I emphasize the regime-contingent nature of
   these effects by demonstrating that they are reversed when considering

   forward in my theory through illustrative historical cases of sovereign
   debt default in Zambia and Peru, in which I demonstrate that fear of
   urban unrest in the face of rapidly increasing food prices did indeed
   drive autocratic elites to default on international debt obligations. In
   addition to providing the first political theory of debt default in
   autocracies, the article introduces two robust predictors of autocratic
   default that have been overlooked in previous work, and highlights the
   importance of urban-rural dynamics in nondemocratic regimes.

AB There is broad agreement in the literature that international courts
   (ICs) make decisions with bounded discretion in relation to state
   governments. However, the scope of this discretion, and the determinants
   of its boundaries, are highly contested. In particular, the central
   mechanism in separation-of-powers models of judicial politics - the
   possibility of legislative override-has raised controversy. We argue
   that the uncertainty that judges face regarding the political reactions
   to their decisions has important and undertheorized implications for
   their behavior. On the one hand, cautious judges are likely to be
   attentive to signals that contain information about the probability of
   an unfavorable override. On the other hand, misjudgments of the
   political risks are likely to be made. Thus, the possibility of override
   is a significant factor affecting judicial behavior, but it is also a
   fairly blunt mechanism for balancing the independence and accountability
   of courts. The empirical study focuses on the Court of Justice of the
   European Union (CJEU), which has long been at the center of theory
   development regarding the legalization of world politics and the rise of
   international courts. The results demonstrate a strong correlation
   between the CJEU's rulings and the political signals it receives, in a
   pattern that goes beyond legal merit, and that fits with the override
   mechanism. State governments are crucial parts of the broader audience
   that defines the political boundaries of judicial discretion.

AB Sensitive survey techniques (SSTs) are frequently used to study
   sensitive behaviors. However, existing strategies for employing SSTs
   lead to highly variable prevalence estimates and do not permit analysts
   to address the question of whether the use of an SST is actually
   necessary. The current article presents a survey questioning strategy
   and corresponding statistical framework that fills this gap. By jointly
   analyzing survey responses generated by an SST (the crosswise model)
   along with direct responses about the sensitive behavior, the article's
   framework addresses the question of whether the use of an SST is
   required to study a given sensitive behavior, provides an efficient
   estimate of the prevalence of the sensitive behavior, and, in its
   extended form, efficiently estimates how individual characteristics
   relate to the likelihood of engaging in the behavior. The utility of the
   approach is demonstrated through an examination of gender differences in
   proclivities towards corruption in Costa Rica.

AB Political scientists increasingly use instrumental variable (IV)
   methods, and must often choose between operationalizing their endogenous
   treatment variable as discrete or continuous. For theoretical and data
   availability reasons, researchers frequently coarsen treatments with
   multiple intensities (e.g., treating a continuous treatment as binary).
   I show how such coarsening can substantially upwardly bias IV estimates
   by subtly violating the exclusion restriction assumption, and
   demonstrate that the extent of this bias depends upon the first stage
   and underlying causal response function. However, standard IV methods
   using a treatment where multiple intensities are affected by the
   instrument-even when fine-grained measurement at every intensity is not
   possible-recover a consistent causal estimate without requiring a
   stronger exclusion restriction assumption. These analytical insights are
   illustrated in the context of identifying the long-run effect of high
   school education on voting Conservative in Great Britain. I demonstrate
   that coarsening years of schooling into an indicator for completing high
   school upwardly biases the IV estimate by a factor of three.

AB Existing methods for estimating ideal points of legislators that are
   comparable across time and chambers make restrictive assumptions
   regarding how legislators' ideal points can move over time, either by
   fixing some legislators' ideal points or by constraining their movement
   over time. These assumptions are clearly contradictory to some theories
   of congressional responsiveness to election dynamics and changes in
   constituency. Instead of using legislators as anchors, our approach
   relies on matching roll calls in one chamber and session with roll calls
   or cosponsorship decisions on identical bills introduced in a different
   chamber or session. By using these "bridge decisions" to achieve
   comparability, we can remove any assumptions about the movement of
   legislators' ideal points. We produce these estimates for both chambers
   from the 102nd (1991-92) to 111th (2009-11) Congresses, and we show that
   our estimates provide interesting insights into the nature of
   legislative behavior change.

AB Models of ideal point estimation usually build on the assumption of
   spatial preferences. This ignores legislators' non-policy incentives and
   is thus likely to produce implausible results for many legislatures. We
   study this problem in parliamentary systems and develop a model of roll
   call voting that considers both the policy and the non-policy, tactical
   incentives of legislators. We go on to show how the relative weight of
   these policy and tactical incentives is influenced by the identity of
   the mover and characteristics of the motion. Analyses of two data sets
   of 2174 roll call votes in German state legislatures and 3295 roll call
   votes in the British House of Commons result in three main findings.
   First, we show that tactical incentives may be more important than
   policy incentives, and second, that the importance of tactical
   incentives varies with the importance of motions. Third, there are
   interesting twists: backbench private members' bills may reverse
   tactical incentives whereas proposals from anti-system parties are
   virtually always rejected by moderate parties, rendering these votes
   uninformative. Our findings have implications for ideal point estimation
   in parliamentary systems, as well as for research on separation of power

AB Guessing on closed-ended knowledge items is common. Under likely-to-hold
   assumptions, in the presence of guessing, the most common estimator of
   learning, difference between pre- and postprocess scores, is negatively
   biased. To account for guessing-related error, we develop a latent class
   model of how people respond to knowledge questions and identify the
   model with the mild assumption that people do not lose knowledge over
   short periods of time. A Monte Carlo simulation over a broad range of
   informative processes and knowledge items shows that the simple
   difference score is negatively biased and the method we develop here is
   unbiased. To demonstrate its use, we apply our model to data from
   Deliberative Polls. We find that estimates of learning, once adjusted
   for guessing, are about 13% higher. Adjusting for guessing also
   eliminates the gender gap in learning, and halves the pre-deliberation
   gender gap on political knowledge.

AB A dominant trend in models with binary outcomes is to control for
   unmodeled duration dependence by including temporal dependence
   variables. A second, distinct trend is to interpret both the short- and
   longterm effects of explanatory variables in autoregressive models.
   While the first trend is nearly ubiquitous in models with binary
   outcomes, the second trend has yet to be applied consistently beyond
   models with continuous outcomes. While scholars use temporal splines and
   cubic polynomials to model the underlying hazard rate, they have
   neglected the fact that this causes the explanatory variables to have a
   long-term effect (LTE) by modifying the future values of the temporal
   dependence variables. In this article, I propose a simple technique that
   estimates a wide range of probabilistic LTEs in models with temporal
   dependence variables. These effects can range from simple LTEs for a
   one-time change in an explanatory variable to more complex scenarios
   where effects change in magnitude with time and compound across repeated
   events. I then replicate Clare's (2010, Ideological fractionalization

   of government fractionalization on conflict behavior to show that

AB In both political behavior research and voting rights litigation,
   turnout and vote choice for different racial groups are often inferred
   using aggregate election results and racial composition. Over the past
   several decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address
   this ecological inference problem. We propose an alternative method to
   reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from
   voter registration records. Building on the existing methodological
   literature, we use Bayes's rule to combine the Census Bureau's Surname
   List with various information from geocoded voter registration records.
   We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using
   approximately nine million voter registration records from Florida,
   where self-reported ethnicity is available. We find that it is possible
   to reduce the false positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6%
   and 3%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above
   80%. Moreover, we use our predictions to estimate turnout by race and
   find that our estimates yields substantially less amounts of bias and
   root mean squared error than standard ecological inference estimates. We
   provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology.

AB One of the most robust findings on political institutions is that
   compulsory voting (CV) reduces the participation gap between poorer and
   wealthier voters. We present evidence that in Brazil, the largest
   country to use such a rule, CV increases inequality in turnout. We use
   individual-level data on 140 million Brazilian citizens and two
   age-based discontinuities to estimate the heterogeneous effects of CV by
   educational achievement, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status.
   Evidence from both thresholds shows that the causal effect of CV on
   turnout among the more educated is at least twice the size of the effect
   among those with less education. To explain this result, which is the
   opposite of what is predicted by the existing literature, we argue that
   nonmonetary penalties for abstention primarily affect middle-and
   upper-class voters and thus increase their turnout disproportionately.
   Survey evidence from a national sample provides evidence for the
   mechanism. Our results show that studies of CV should consider
   nonmonetary sanctions, as their effects can reverse standard
   predictions.

AB Time series techniques see widespread use in political science. In De
   Boef and Keele (2008) we outlined a set of statistical methods for
   stationary data. Those methods have come to be widely used. Grant and
   Lebo (2015) contend that one of the methods we discussed, the error
   correction model, should generally not be used with political data. They
   argue that the error correction model leads to both interpretational and
   inferential mistakes by applied analysts. While we agree with their
   statements about equation balance, we show that the error correction
   model leads to the same inferences as the autoregressive distributed lag
   model when the data are stationary. We also demonstrate that careful use
   of an error correction model can help diagnose model misspecification
   when the equation is unbalanced. Such techniques are useful since
   pretesting for integration and fractional integration is often a highly
   uncertain process, which we demonstrate through a simulation exercise.
   We also highlight two related but often ignored complications in time
   series: low power and overfitting. We argue that the statistical tests
   used in time series analyses have little power to detect differences in
   many of the sample sizes typical in political science. Moreover, given
   small sample sizes, many analysts overfit their time series models. We
   argue that the results in the Grant and Lebo replications stem from
   inadequate sample sizes that make it difficult to conclusively use any
   time series model.*

AB The International Monetary Fund (IMF) often seeks to influence
   countries' domestic public policy via varying levels of
   conditionalitylinking financial support to borrowing governments'
   commitment to policy reforms. When does extensive conditionality
   encourage domestic economic reforms and when does it impede them? We
   argue that, rather than universally benefiting or harming reforms, the
   effects of stricter IMF conditionality depend on domestic partisan
   politics. More IMF conditions can pressure left-wing governments into
   undertaking more ambitious reforms with little resistance from partisan
   rivals on the right; under right governments, however, more conditions
   hinder reform implementation by heightening resistance from the left
   while simultaneously reducing leaders' ability to win their support
   through concessions or compromise. Using data on post-communist IMF
   programs for the period 1994-2010, we find robust evidence supporting
   these claims, even after addressing the endogeneity of IMF programs via

   model of man and of citizen, that is, the model of natural man in
   society. I argue that it provides an original way of resisting
   dependence through a combination of distance from corrupt values and
   adaptation to the mechanisms of the economic market. Emile's ultimate
   function, however, is critical in addition to being practical and
   pedagogical. By following Emile's experiences, the reader learns the
   unbearably high cost of commercial society: Freedom within it is

AB How sexuality should be regulated in a liberal political community is an
   important, controversial theoretical and empirical questionas shown by
   the recent criminalization of possession of some adult pornography in
   the United Kingdom. Supporters of criminalization argue that Mill, often
   considered a staunch opponent of censorship, would support prohibition
   due to his feminist commitments. I argue that this account
   underestimates the strengths of the Millian account of private conduct
   and free expression, and the consistency of Millian anticensorship with
   feminist values. A Millian contextual defense of liberty, however,
   suggests several other policy approaches to addressing the harms of
   pornography.

   may figure into the activation and maintenance of group categories,
   boundaries, and identities, as well as the mediating role played by
   organizations in such processes. The framework's analytical advantages
   are demonstrated in an application to southern lynchings. Findings from
   event- and community-level analyses suggest that "public" lynchings,
   carried out by larger mobs with ceremonial violence, but not "private"
   ones, perpetrated by smaller bands without public or ceremonial
   violence, fed off and into the racial group boundaries, categories, and
   identities promoted by the southern Democratic Party at the turn of the
   20th century and on which the emerging Jim Crow system rested
   Highlighting that racialized inequalities cannot be properly understood
   apart from collective processes of racial group boundary and identity
   making, the article offers clues to the mechanisms by which past racial
   domination influences contemporary race relations.

AB This study outlines a theory of social class based on workplace
   ownership and authority relations, and it investigates the link between
   social class and growth in personal income inequality since the 1980s.
   Inequality trends are governed by changes in between-class income
   differences, changes in the relative size of different classes, and
   changes in within-class income dispersion. Data from the General Social
   Survey are used to investigate each of these changes in turn and to
   evaluate their impact on growth in inequality at the population level.
   Results indicate that between-class income differences grew by about 60%
   since the 1980s and that the relative size of different classes remained
   fairly stable. A formal decomposition analysis indicates that changes in
   the relative size of different social classes had a small dampening
   effect and that growth in between-class income differences had a large
   inflationary effect on trends in personal income inequality.

   show how knowledge about biological etiology can interact with the
   "kinds of people" delineated by diagnostic categories in ways that
   "loop" or modify both over time. The authors use historical materials to
   show how "geneticization" played a crucial role in binding together
   autism as a biosocial community and how evidence from genetics research
   later made an important contribution to the diagnostic expansion of
   autism. In the second part of the article, the authors draw on
   quantitative and qualitative analyses of autism rates over time in
   several rare conditions that are delineated strictly according to
   genomic mutations in order to demonstrate that these changes in
   diagnostic practice helped to both increase autism's prevalence and
   create its enormous genetic heterogeneity. Thus, a looping process that
   began with geneticization and involved the social effects of genetics
   research itself transformed the autism population and its genetic

   data usage during the billing cycle a dynamic problem, thus generating
   variation in the (shadow) price of usage. We provide evidence that
   subscribers respond to this variation, and we use their dynamic
   decisions to estimate a flexible distribution of willingness to pay for
   different plan characteristics. Using the estimates, we simulate demand
   under alternative pricing and find that usage-based pricing eliminates

AB The U.S. Prohibition experience shows a remarkable policy reversal. In
   only 14 years, a drastic shift in public opinion required two
   constitutional amendments. I develop and estimate a model of endogenous
   law enforcement, determined by beliefs about the Prohibition-crime nexus
   and alcohol-related moral views. In turn, the policy outcomes shape
   subsequent learning about Prohibition enforcement costs. I estimate the
   model through maximum likelihood on Prohibition Era city-level data on
   police enforcement, crime, and alcohol-related legislation. The model
   can account for the variation in public opinion changes, and the
   heterogeneous responses of law enforcement and violence across cities.
   Results show that a 15% increase in the homicide rate can be attributed
   to Prohibition enforcement. The subsequent learning-driven adjustment of
   local law enforcement allowed for the alcohol market to rebound to 60%
   of its pre-Prohibition size. I conclude with counterfactual exercises
   exploring the welfare implications of policy learning, prior beliefs,
   preference polarization, and alternative political environments. Results
   illustrate the importance of incorporating the endogenous nature of law
   enforcement into our understanding of policy failure and policy success.

   convergence times for general weakly acyclic games, including
   coordination games, dominance solvable games, games with strategic
   complementarities, potential games, and many others with applications in
   economics, biology, and distributed control. If players' better replies
   are governed by idiosyncratic shocks, the convergence time can grow
   exponentially in the population size; moreover, this is true even in
   games with very simple payoff structures. However, if their responses
   are sufficiently correlated due to aggregate shocks, the convergence
   time is greatly accelerated; in fact, it is bounded for all sufficiently
   large populations. We provide explicit bounds on the speed of
   convergence as a function of key structural parameters including the
   number of strategies, the length of the better reply paths, the extent
   to which players can influence the payoffs of others, and the desired
   degree of approximation to Nash equilibrium.

   political stability. Employing a panel data set across 262 prefectures
   and exploring the variations in the quotas on the entry-level exam
   candidates, we find that higher quotas per capita were associated with a
   higher probability of revolution participation after the abolition and a
   higher incidence of uprisings in 1911 that marked the end of the 2,000
   years of imperial rule. This finding is robust to various checks
   including using the number of small rivers and short-run exam
   performance before the quota system as instruments. The patterns in the
   data appear most consistent with the interpretation that in regions with
   higher quotas per capita under the exam system, more would-be elites
   were negatively affected by the abolition. In addition, we document that
   modern human capital in the form of those studying in Japan also
   contributed to the revolution and that social capital strengthened the
   effect of quotas on revolution participation.

AB We show that firms' individually optimal liquidity management results in

   firms decide on the level of their liquid resources facing cash-flow
   shocks and time-varying investment opportunities. Firms' liquidity
   management decisions generate simultaneous waves in aggregate cash
   holdings and investment, even if technology remains constant. These
   investment waves are not constrained efficient in general, because the
   social and private value of liquidity differs. The resulting pecuniary
   externality affects incentives differentially depending on the state of
   the economy, and often overinvestment occurs during booms and
   underinvestment occurs during recessions. In general, policies intended
   to mitigate underinvestment raise prices during recessions, making
   overinvestment during booms worse. However, a well-designed
   price-support policy will increase welfare in both booms and recessions.

AB We analyze the implications of household-level adjustment costs for the
   dynamics of aggregate consumption. We show that an economy in which
   agents have consumption commitments is approximately equivalent to a
   habit formation model in which the habit stock is a weighted average of
   past consumption if idiosyncratic risk is large relative to aggregate
   risk. Consumption commitments can thus explain the empirical regularity
   that consumption is excessively sensitive and excessively smooth,
   findings that are typically attributed to habit formation. Unlike habit
   formation and other theories, but consistent with empirical evidence,
   the consumption commitments model also predicts that excess sensitivity
   and smoothness vanish for large shocks. These results suggest that
   behavior previously attributed to habit formation may be better
   explained by adjustment costs. We develop additional testable
   predictions to further distinguish the commitment and habit models and
   show that the two models have different welfare implications.

AB This paper examines how prices, markups, and marginal costs respond to
   trade liberalization. We develop a framework to estimate markups from
   production data with multi-product firms. This approach does not require
   assumptions on the market structure or demand curves faced by firms, nor
   assumptions on how firms allocate their inputs across products. We
   exploit quantity and price information to disentangle markups from
   quantity-based productivity, and then compute marginal costs by dividing
   observed prices by the estimated markups. We use India's trade
   liberalization episode to examine how firms adjust these performance
   measures. Not surprisingly, we find that trade liberalization lowers
   factory-gate prices and that output tariff declines have the expected
   pro-competitive effects. However, the price declines are small relative
   to the declines in marginal costs, which fall predominantly because of
   the input tariff liberalization. The reason for this incomplete cost
   pass-through to prices is that firms offset their reductions in marginal
   costs by raising markups. Our results demonstrate substantial
   heterogeneity and variability in markups across firms and time and
   suggest that producers benefited relative to consumers, at least
   immediately after the reforms.

AB The question of whether and how mutual fund managers provide valuable
   services for their clients motivates one of the largest literatures in
   finance. One candidate explanation is that funds process information
   about future asset values and use that information to invest in
   high-valued assets. But formal theories are scarce because information
   choice models with many assets are difficult to solve as well as
   difficult to test. This paper tackles both problems by developing a new
   attention allocation model that uses the state of the business cycle to
   predict information choices, which in turn, predict observable patterns
   of portfolio investments and returns. The predictions about fund
   portfolios' covariance with payoff shocks, cross-fund portfolio and
   return dispersion, and their excess returns are all supported by the
   data. These findings offer new evidence that some investment managers
   have skill and that attention is allocated rationally.

AB Propensity score matching estimators (Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)) are
   widely used in evaluation research to estimate average treatment
   effects. In this article, we derive the large sample distribution of
   propensity score matching estimators. Our derivations take into account
   that the propensity score is itself estimated in a first step, prior to
   matching. We prove that first step estimation of the propensity score
   affects the large sample distribution of propensity score matching
   estimators, and derive adjustments to the large sample variances of
   propensity score matching estimators of the average treatment effect
   (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET). The
   adjustment for the ATE estimator is negative (or zero in some special
   cases), implying that matching on the estimated propensity score is more
   efficient than matching on the true propensity score in large samples.
   However, for the ATET estimator, the sign of the adjustment term depends
   on the data generating process, and ignoring the estimation error in the
   propensity score may lead to confidence intervals that are either too
   large or too small.

AB We present a methodology for estimating the distributional effects of an
   endogenous treatment that varies at the group level when there are
   group-level unobservables, a quantile extension of Hausman and Taylor,
   1981. Because of the presence of group-level unobservables, standard
   quantile regression techniques are inconsistent in our setting even if
   the treatment is independent of unobservables. In contrast, our
   estimation technique is consistent as well as computationally simple,
   consisting of group-by-group quantile regression followed by two-stage
   least squares. Using the Bahadur representation of quantile estimators,
   we derive weak conditions on the growth of the number of observations
   per group that are sufficient for consistency and asymptotic zero-mean
   normality of our estimator. As in Hausman and Taylor, 1981, micro-level
   covariates can be used as internal instruments for the endogenous
   group-level treatment if they satisfy relevance and exogeneity
   conditions. Our approach applies to a broad range of settings including
   labor, public finance, industrial organization, urban economics, and
   development; we illustrate its usefulness with several such examples.
   Finally, an empirical application of our estimator finds that low-wage
   earners in the United States from 1990 to 2007 were significantly more
   affected by increased Chinese import competition than high-wage earners.

AB The basic argument in this article is that sociology and social science
   more generally are today severely hampered by the lack of attention
   being paid to theory. Methods - qualitative as well as quantitative
   methods - have proven to be very useful in practical research (as
   opposed to theory); and as a result they dominate modern social science.
   They do not, however, do the job that belongs to theory. One way to
   redress the current imbalance between methods and theory, it is
   suggested, would be to pay more attention to theorizing, that is, to the
   actual process that precedes the final formulation of a theory; and in
   this way improve theory. Students of social science are today primarily
   exposed to finished theories and are not aware of the process that goes
   into the production and design of a theory. Students need to be taught
   how to construct a theory in practical terms (theorizing'); and one good
   way to do so is through exercises. This is the way that methods are
   being taught by tradition; and it helps the students to get a hands-on
   knowledge, as opposed to just a reading knowledge of what a theory is
   all about. Students more generally need to learn how to construct a
   theory while drawing on empirical material. The article contains a
   suggestion for the steps that need to be taken when you theorize. Being
   trained in what sociology and social science are all about - an
   important precondition! - students may proceed as follows. You start out
   by observing, in an attempt to get a good empirical grip on the topic
   before any theory is introduced. Once this has been done, it may be time
   to name the phenomenon; and either turn the name into a concept as the
   next step or bring in some existing concepts in an attempt to get a
   handle on the topic. At this stage one can also try to make use of
   analogies, metaphors and perhaps a typology, in an attempt to both give
   body to the theory and to invest it with some process. The last element
   in theorizing is to come up with an explanation; and at this point it
   may be helpful to draw on some ideas by Charles Peirce, especially his
   notion of abduction. Before having been properly tested against
   empirical material, according to the rules of the scientific community,
   the theory should be considered unproven. Students who are interested in
   learning more about theorizing may want to consult the works of such
   people as Everett C. Hughes, C. Wright Mills, Ludwig Wittgenstein and
   James G. March. Many of the issues that are central to theorizing are
   today also being studied in cognitive science; and for those who are
   interested in pursuing this type of literature, handbooks represent a
   good starting point. The article ends by arguing that more theorizing
   will not only redress the balance between theory and methods; it will
   also make sociology and social science more interesting.

AB One of the on-going consequences of recent financial crises seems to be
   that the conventional anchor' measures of global finance (such as the US
   dollar, treasury bonds and AAA rated securities) are no longer playing
   the anchoring role once believed of them. LIBOR now needs to be added to
   this list and not just because it has been tarnished by illegal
   practices, but because it is looking increasingly surpassed by financial
   market practices. LIBOR was believed to provide a risk-free rate of
   interest, but has been revealed to be risk-laden. Moreover, LIBOR is a
   measure of the costs of borrowing, whilst market concern is increasingly
   with measures of interest rate volatility. This paper looks at why, in
   the context of crisis, financial market focus on interest rates is
   turning towards other benchmarks, notably the overnight indexed swap
   (OIS) market, and what this shift might be telling us about the
   anchoring requirements of global financial markets.

AB This paper notes the contemporary emergence of morality' in both
   sociological argument and political rhetoric, and analyses its
   significance in relation to ongoing UK welfare reforms. It revisits the
   idea of moral economy' and identifies two strands in its contemporary
   application; that all economies depend on an internal moral schema, and
   that some external moral evaluation is desirable. UK welfare reform is
   analysed as an example of the former, with reference to three distinct
   orientations advanced in the work of Freeden (), Laclau (), and Lockwood
   (). In this light, the paper then considers challenges to the reform
   agenda, drawn from third sector and other public sources. It outlines
   the forms of argument present in these challenges, based respectively on
   rationality, legality, and morality, which together provide a basis for
   evaluation of the welfare reforms and for an alternative moral economy'.

AB This article argues against the assumption that agency and reflexivity
   disappear in an age of algorithmic power' (Lash 2007). Following the
   suggestions of Beer (2009), it proposes that, far from disappearing, new
   forms of agency and reflexivity around the embedding in everyday
   practice of not only algorithms but also analytics more broadly are
   emerging, as social actors continue to pursue their social ends but
   mediated through digital interfaces: this is the consequence of many
   social actors now needing their digital presence, regardless of whether
   they want this, to be measured and counted. The article proposes social
   analytics' as a new topic for sociology: the sociological study of
   social actors' uses of analytics not for the sake of measurement itself
   (or to make profit from measurement) but in order to fulfil better their
   social ends through an enhancement of their digital presence. The
   article places social analytics in the context of earlier debates about
   categorization, algorithmic power, and self-presentation online, and
   describes in detail a case study with a UK community organization which
   generated the social analytics approach. The article concludes with
   reflections on the implications of this approach for further
   sociological fieldwork in a digital world.

AB Counterrevolutions have received far less scholarly attention than
   revolutions, despite their comparable importance in shaping the modern
   political world. This article defines counterrevolutions as collective
   and reactive efforts to defend the status quo and its varied range of
   dominant elites against a credible threat to overturn them from below.
   Unlike analysts who see the origins of political order lying in
   mass-mobilizing revolutionary parties, the authors illuminate the
   distinctive order-producing attributes of elite-protecting
   counterrevolutionary parties. A comparative-historical analysis of five
   former British colonies in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa
   elaborates the causal mechanisms through which counterrevolutions can
   produce exceedingly durable, although not invincible, political orders.

AB This paper proposes a re-thinking of the relationship between sociology
   and the biological sciences. Tracing lines of connection between the
   history of sociology and the contemporary landscape of biology, the
   paper argues for a reconfiguration of this relationship beyond popular
   rhetorics of biologization' or medicalization'. At the heart of the
   paper is a claim that, today, there are some potent new frames for
   re-imagining the traffic between sociological and biological research -
   even for revitalizing' the sociological enterprise as such. The paper
   threads this argument through one empirical case: the relationship
   between urban life and mental illness. In its first section, it shows
   how this relationship enlivened both early psychiatric epidemiology, and
   some forms of the new discipline of sociology; it then traces the
   historical division of these sciences, as the sociological investment in
   psychiatric questions waned, and the social' become marginalized within
   an increasingly biological' psychiatry. In its third section, however,
   the paper shows how this relationship has lately been revivified, but
   now by a nuanced epigenetic and neurobiological attention to the links
   between mental health and urban life. What role can sociology play here?
   In its final section, the paper shows how this older sociology, with its
   lively interest in the psychiatric and neurobiological vicissitudes of
   urban social life, can be our guide in helping to identify intersections
   between sociological and biological attention. With a new century now
   underway, the paper concludes by suggesting that the relationship
   between urban life and mental illness may prove a core testing-ground
   for a revitalized' sociology.

AB Virtually every discussion of secularization asserts that high levels of
   religiosity in the United States make it a decisive counterexample to
   the claim that modern societies are prone to secularization. Focusing on
   trends rather than levels, the authors maintain that, for two
   straightforward empirical reasons, the United States should no longer be
   considered a counterexample. First, it has recently become clear that
   American religiosity has been declining for decades. Second, this
   decline has been produced by the generational patterns underlying
   religious decline elsewhere in the West: each successive cohort is less
   religious than the preceding one. America is not an exception. These
   findings change the theoretical import of the United States for debates
   about secularization.

AB A lack of collective efficacy in neighborhoods is associated with social
   and physical disorder and related anti-social actions. It is less clear,
   however, whether collective efficacy in neighborhoods also enhances
   prosocial, other-regarding behavior. We studied this association by
   employing the Lost Letter Technique in a large-scale field experiment.
   Our data stem from 1,240 letters dropped in a representative sample of
   110 Dutch neighborhoods, combined with neighborhood data based on a
   survey of residents (SSND2, n = 996) and information provided by
   Statistics Netherlands. We distinguish between two conditions: (1)
   location of the lost letter, that is, behind a car's windshield wiper or
   on the sidewalk; and (2) type of addressee, that is, a Dutch name or a
   Turkish/Moroccan name. When we decompose collective efficacy into social
   cohesion and shared expectations of social control, we find that shared
   control expectations clearly matter for the rate of posted letters.
   Social cohesion has no effect. Furthermore, a high percentage of
   non-Western residents, high residential mobility, and a relatively low
   local income level are negatively related to the rate of posted letters.

AB Does contentious collective action matter? Whereas most social movement
   literature has addressed this question in the US context for policy
   change outcomes, this paper takes a different approach by bringing the
   question to a global context and examines democratization as a
   structural outcome. Accordingly, we test several hypotheses about the
   ephemeral, positive, and negative influences of contentious collective
   action on the democratization process in a given country, as well as the
   cross-border effect of the contention. To go beyond the limitations of
   previous studies, this paper uses a monthly time-series, cross-national
   model to examine potential liberalizing or deliberalizing effects of
   protest activities. Using data from 103 non-democratic countries from
   1990 to 2004, we find that protests and riots increase the probability
   that a country will liberalize in a given month. We find that while
   contentious events in other countries do not directly increase the risk
   of liberalization, external contentious events, especially those that
   lead to political liberalization, increase the count of contentious
   events, thus indirectly boosting liberalization. We find no evidence
   that protest significantly increases the chances of deliberalization.
   Together, our findings show a key role for non-elite political actors to
   influence political liberalization.

AB Gaining attention in the mass media is a key goal of many social
   movement organizations (SMOs). The dominant explanation of media
   attention to SMOs is that the media act like a filter, selecting some
   types of SMOs and events for attention, and ignoring others based on
   characteristics of these SMOs, events, and their political environment.
   In contrast to this "bias model," I argue that some media attention to
   SMOs is characterized by positive feedback, or rich-get-richer
   processes: past media attention increases the likelihood of future media
   attention through its effect on the SMO and on other media outlets. Like
   other positive feedback systems, media attention can be path dependent,
   is routinely punctuated by large cascades of attention to previously
   obscure SMOs, and can be contingent on "accidents" of history: at
   critical junctures, individuals, organizations, and events have the
   potential to radically impact the extent of media attention to their
   movements and organizations. Media attention to SMOs can also become
   decoupled from the types of events that initially sparked their media
   attention, becoming spokes-organizations for their movements and
   receiving media attention for events and stories that they themselves
   are not involved. In support of this theory, I first show that media
   attention is, similar to other positive feedback processes, power-law
   distributed across SMOs using two national (US) data sets. I then
   illustrate the process of positive feedback in media attention through a
   case study of the Black Panther Party's rise to prominence in media
   attention.

AB Activists seek attention for their causes and want to win sympathy from
   the broader public. Why do some citizens but not others approve when
   activists use protest tactics? This is a crucial but poorly understood
   aspect of social movements. While most prior research has focused on the
   personal determinants of attitudes toward movements, we argue that
   proximity to protest may cultivate positive views about a movement.
   Individuals living near centers of movement activity may become more
   favorable to protest because they become more sympathetic to the demands
   of activists. We investigate public support about protest tactics among
   white Southerners during the early stages of the civil rights movement.
   To do so, we employ a representative survey conducted in 1961 with
   nearly 700 white adults living in the South. These survey data are
   combined with contextual data measuring local protest, political
   behavior, and civic organizations. Most scholars have focused on the
   ways that civil rights activity propelled white counter-mobilization,
   but protest also won sympathy from a small subset of white Southerners,
   thereby fracturing the dominant consensus in support of Jim Crow
   segregation. We also find that local racial political context matters:
   individuals living in counties with weaker support for segregationist
   politics, where white moderates were active, and outside the Deep South
   were generally more favorable. At the individual level, our strongest
   findings indicate that sit-in support was more likely from those with
   greater educational attainment, less frequent church attendance, and
   exposure to discussions about race relations from the pulpit.

AB Previous research suggests that increasing job mobility leads to

   in job mobility can be inequality reducing, depending on the
   macro-structural context in which job changes become more frequent. I
   demonstrate empirical evidence by applying a new analytical approach to
   data from the South Korean economic crisis of the late 1990s. I find
   that rates of job transitions increased significantly during and after
   the economic crisis, and that more frequent movements between jobs
   ameliorated the rising trend in inequality: in other words, inequality
   in occupational status after the crisis would have been even greater had
   it not been for changes in the pattern of transitions between jobs.

AB Why are only some violent political actors designated as terrorists? To
   answer this question, I examine formal terrorism designations made by
   the US government. Conceptualizing terrorism designation as a marker of
   organizational illegitimacy, I hypothesize that groups that appear more
   like a state-effective, representative, and secular-are more likely to
   be seen as legitimate contenders for political power. As a result, these
   groups have a lower risk of being designated as terrorists. Conversely,
   groups that target more legitimate states have a higher risk of being
   designated as terrorists. Empirically, I demonstrate several facts in
   support of these hypotheses. First, the United States has
   disproportionately labeled weak and politically non-representative
   groups as terrorists. Second, it has disproportionately labeled groups
   in countries with greater state capacity as terrorists. Third,
   especially in recent years, it has disproportionately labeled Islamist
   groups as terrorists.

AB Immigrants' racial/ethnic status has profound implications for their

   financial well-being-wealth or net worth-and consider how both skin tone
   and race/ethnicity contribute to wealth inequality. To assess these dual
   influences, we use the New Immigrant Survey and the recently developed
   preference for whiteness hypothesis to argue that darker-skinned
   immigrants will have lower levels of wealth and will be less likely to
   own certain assets. Results generally support the hypothesis with the
   strongest evidence apparent in the full sample and among Asian
   immigrants. Overall, the results illuminate how immigrants with a

   forms of disadvantage relative to white and/or lighter-skinned
   immigrants.

AB Since the emergence of Mexico's secretariat for public education
   following the revolution (1910-1920), reducing indigenous inequality in
   educational mobility has been a state objective. Recently, findings have
   been mixed, with some finding that indigeneity no longer limits
   educational mobility and others showing evidence of persistent in
   equality net of socioeconomic background. We draw from modernization
   theory and the theory of Maximally Maintained Inequality (MMI) to assess
   six decades of education policy. Using the Mexican Family Life Survey (n
   = 88,547), we find that indigenous disadvantage in terms of educational
   mobility, which marked cohorts immediately after the revolution, shifts
   to near parity in more recent cohorts. Contrary to what MMI would
   predict, indigenous disadvantage declines for lower secondary
   transitions, despite nearly a third of eligible students failing to
   transition. Rather than a single, targeted policy period, we observe a
   somewhat monotonic decline in inequality by indigeneity across all
   levels of schooling, even if saturation has yet to be attained.
   Modernization theory, rather than MMI, is a more reasonable match for
   the observed pattern. Although not the case in earlier decades, for
   recent cohorts we conclude that socioeconomic inequality rather than
   ethnicity per se has become the main source of indigenous inequality in
   educational mobility.

AB In the past four decades, women have made major inroads into occupations
   previously dominated by men. This paper examines whether occupational
   feminization is accompanied by a decline in wages: Do workers suffer a
   wage penalty if they remain in, or move into, feminizing occupations? We
   analyze this question over the 1990s and 2000s in Britain, Germany, and
   Switzerland, using longitudinal panel data to estimate individual fixed
   effects for men and women. Moving from an entirely male to an entirely
   female occupation entails a loss in individual earnings of 13 percent in
   Britain, 7 percent in Switzerland, and 3 percent in Germany. The impact
   of occupational feminization on wages is not linear, but sets apart
   occupations holding more than 60 percent of women. Moving into such
   female occupations incurs a wage penalty. Contrary to the prevailing
   idea in economics, differences in productivity-human capital,
   job-specific skills, and time investment-do not fully explain the wage
   gap between male and female occupations. The wage penalty associated
   with working in a female occupation is also much larger where employer
   discretion is greater-in the private sector-than where wage-setting is
   guided by formal rules-the public sector. These findings suggest that
   wage disparities across male and female occupations are due to gender
   devaluation.

   Yet, we also find comparable relationships between PhD program and both

AB This paper bridges insights from theories of collective action, power,
   and influence to address the conditions under which group leaders solve
   collective action problems. We show how leaders' behaviors impact the
   success of collective action groups as a whole via both power and
   influence processes. In a laboratory experiment, groups first completed
   a baseline measure of cooperation in a public good dilemma without
   punishment. In a second phase, the capacity to punish was introduced.
   One condition, the "peer-sanctioning condition," was equivalent to the
   prevailing solution in the experimental literature on collective action,
   where the ability to punish others is distributed equally among all
   group members. In the other two conditions, only a single group "leader"
   could punish; we varied whether the person assigned to lead was
   other-regarding (prosocial) or self-regarding (proself). The results
   support our prediction that prosocial leaders increase their
   contributions to the group after ascending to leadership, while proself
   leaders reduce their contributions. Further, as expected, rank-and-file
   group members are influenced by leaders' contribution behaviors; as a
   result, prosocial-led groups as a whole were substantially more
   productive than proself-led groups. Indeed, as predicted, prosocial
   leaders were even more effective in maintaining large group
   contributions than the standard peer-sanctioning system. These findings
   suggest that putting power and influence in the right hands solves
   collective action problems and promotes collective welfare.

AB The tension between individual and collective interests and the
   provision of sanctioning mechanisms have been identified as important
   building blocks of a theory of norm emergence. Correspondingly, most
   investigations focus on how social norms emerge through explicit
   bargaining and social exchange to overcome this tension, and how
   sanctions enforce norm compliance. However, sanctioning presupposes the
   existence of the behavior at which it is directed, and the question of
   how behavior worth sanctioning can emerge tacitly if communication is
   not possible has hitherto received little attention. Here, we argue that
   game theory offers an ideal framework for theorizing about emergent
   behavioral regularities and show how latent norms can emerge from
   actors' recurring encounters in similar social dilemmas. We conduct two
   experiments in which small groups of subjects interact repeatedly in a
   volunteer's dilemma. We vary the heterogeneity of group members in terms
   of their costs of cooperation and the way they encounter each other in
   subsequent interactions. Our results show that subjects in homogeneous
   groups take turns at cooperating, whereas in heterogeneous groups mostly
   the subjects with the lowest costs cooperate. The emergence of solitary
   cooperation is moderated by the way subjects encounter each other again
   and their other-regarding preferences.

AB The Latin Americanization thesis posits that the racial hierarchy in the
   United States is now composed of Whites, Honorary Whites, and Collective
   Blacks, with skin tone being the primary determinant of one's placement
   within this tripartite system of social status. Extant research mostly
   examines this approach at the macro level; relatively little is known
   about the thesis at the micro level. By examining goal-oriented task
   groups, our experiment tests whether Whites exhibit transitive levels of
   influence, a behavioral indicator of social status, in a manner
   consistent with this three-tier system. Furthermore, with applications
   of graph-theoretic models from status characteristics and status cue
   theories, we assess the social psychological mechanisms buttressing the
   proposed racial hierarchy by comparing propositions from four theories
   put forth by scholars of race/ethnicity (we translate their propositions
   into graphs and mathematical calculations). In so doing, we pose the
   question: In our experimental setting, which matters more, skin tone or
   ethnic background, or do both have equal effects on behavior? Our
   results support the purported racial hierarchy of the Latin
   Americanization thesis. On average, Whites were influenced the most by
   White confederates; Whites were influenced less by their light-skinned
   Latino/a confederates, and even less by dark-skinned Latino/a
   confederates. Model fit statistics for the propositions translated into
   graphs and values demonstrate that ethnic distinctions and skin tone are
   independent stratifiers in the form of status characteristics. This
   finding supports the notion that skin tone and ethnic background have
   the equivalent capacity to invoke processes to create the tripartite
   system of racial/ethnic inequality.

AB Increases in women's labor-force participation and the time families
   spend at work have reduced the time families have available to care for
   one another. Recent evidence suggests that responses to these challenges
   vary for different types of care. While time spent on housework has
   declined, time devoted to care of children has increased. This paper
   examines cohort changes in another form of unpaid work, care for ill or
   disabled friends or family members, and assesses the influence of
   employment, attitudes, and need for care on age and cohort trends in
   carework. Using data from the National Longitudinal Surveys, we estimate
   age and cohort differences in carework among women born between 1922 and
   1952. We find a decline in overall levels of carework among more recent
   birth cohorts of women. However, we do not find cohort changes in the
   probability that women will provide more intense levels of care, defined
   as nine or more hours of care per week. The amount of illness and
   disability among family members partially reduces differences between
   cohorts, but women's employment and attitudes about work and family do
   little to clarify changing patterns of care. Overall, our findings
   suggest that, even after the large-scale social changes of the twentieth
   century, women will continue to provide carework when necessary. Thus,
   the real concern for families is not whether ill or disabled members
   will have care, but rather, whether their careworkers receive the
   institutional support required to successfully balance paid and unpaid
   work.

AB The comparative study of immigrants' legal rights has become a key focus
   of sociological inquiry in recent decades. However, research in this
   vein has focused primarily on the highest levels of European
   judiciaries. As a result, we know comparatively little about the
   implementation of immigrant rights in the lower courts that are charged
   with enforcing the legal protections of foreigners. Using prosecution
   data from German criminal courts between 1998 and 2010, this study
   addresses this gap by investigating (1) the punishment consequences of
   lacking national membership; (2) sentencing differences between EU and
   non-EU immigrants; and (3) how the punishment of noncitizens has changed
   over time. The findings suggest that foreigners punished in German
   courts receive harsher penalties than comparable German citizens. This
   punishment gap is observed for both EU and non-EU immigrants; however,
   there is clear evidence that the punishment gap between German and
   non-German citizens has waned over the past decade. Taken together,
   these findings inform ongoing debates on the continued significance of
   national membership in Western societies and have important implications
   for understanding contemporary trends in sociolegal inequality.
