AB Behavioral IR faces a fundamental challenge. The actors in most IR
   models and theories are not individuals-they are aggregates like states,
   ministries, interest groups, political parties, and rebel factions.
   There are two broad approaches to attempting to integrate behavioral
   research about individuals. The first, a quasi-behavioral approach,
   makes nonstandard assumptions about the preferences, beliefs, or
   decision- making processes of aggregate actors. The second tries to
   build theories in which the key actors are individuals. Pursuing the
   former means that the assumptions about actors will be only weakly
   linked to the empirical findings propelling behavioral research. The
   second approach faces formidable obstacles that international relations
   theory has confronted for a long time and for the most part has not
   overcome.

AB Psychology is traditionally used in political science to explain
   deviations from rationality. Lost in the debate between rationalists and
   their critics, however, is a sense of whether the kinds of strategic
   self-interested behavior predicted by these models has psychological
   microfoundations: what would homo economicus look like in the real
   world? We argue that strategic rationality varies across individuals and
   is characterized by a pro-self social-value orientation and a high level
   of epistemic motivation. Testing our argument in the context of
   international relations, we employ a laboratory bargaining game and
   integrate it with archival research on German foreign policy-making in
   the 1920s. We find in both contexts that even among those interested in
   maximizing only their own egoistic gains, those with greater epistemic
   motivation are better able to adapt to the strategic situation,
   particularly the distribution of power. Our results build a bridge
   between two approaches often considered to be antithetical to one
   another.

AB While emotions are widely regarded as integral to the "behavioral
   approach" to International Relations (IR), a host of fundamental
   problems have delayed the integration of affective influences into
   traditional models of IR. We aim to integrate affect by focusing on
   commitment problems, a body of work that contains strong theoretical
   predictions about how individual decision makers will and should act.
   Across two lab experiments, we use a novel experimental protocol that
   includes a psychophysiological measure of emotional arousal (skin
   conductance reactivity) to study how individuals react to changes in
   bargaining power. While we find support for one key pillar of IR
   theory-individuals do reject offers when they expect the opponent's
   power to increase-we also find that physiological arousal tampers with
   individuals' ability to think strategically in the manner predicted by
   canonical models. Our followup experiment mimics the elements of
   institutional solutions to commitment problems and finds support for
   their efficacy on the individual level. Our novel findings suggest that
   when individuals face large power shifts, emotional arousal
   short-circuits their ability to "think forward and induct backwards,"
   suggesting that emotionally aroused individuals are less prone to
   commitment problems.

AB The dominant approach to the study of international political economy
   assumes that the policy preferences of individuals and groups reflect
   economic self-interest. Recent research has called this assumption into
   question by suggesting that voters do not have economically
   self-interested preferences about trade policy. We investigate one
   potential explanation for this puzzling finding: economic ignorance. We
   show that most voters do not understand the economic consequences of
   protectionism. We then use experiments to study how voters would respond
   if they had more information about how trade barriers affect the
   distribution of income. We find that distributional cues generate two
   opposing effects: they make people more likely to express self-serving
   policy preferences, but they also make people more sensitive to the
   interests of others. In our study both reactions were evident, but
   selfish responses outweighed altruistic ones. Thus, if people knew more
   about the distributional effects of trade, the correlation between
   personal interests and policy preferences would tighten. By showing how
   the explanatory power of economic self-interest depends on beliefs about
   causality, this research provides a foundation for more realistic,
   behaviorally informed theories of international political economy.

AB Despite advances in the study of individuals in international relations,
   we still know little about how the traits and biases of individuals
   aggregate. Most foreign policy decisions are made in groups, usually by
   elites with varying degrees of experience, which can have both positive
   and negative psychological effects. This paper addresses the aggregation
   problem by exploring how the balance of foreign policy experience among
   leaders and advisers affects decision making in war, using a
   principal-agent framework that allows the relative experience of leaders
   and advisers to vary. A leader's experience affects decision making and,
   ultimately, the risks associated with conflict, through three
   mechanisms. First, experience influences a leader's ability to monitor
   advisers. Second, a leader's experience affects the credibility of
   delegation to experienced advisers and, in turn, the nature and extent
   of information gathering. Third, experience affects whether leaders are
   able to diversify advice, as well as their preference for policies that
   appear certain. I illustrate the argument using two cases that hold an
   unusual number of factors constant: the 1991 and 2003 Iraq Wars. George
   W. Bush's inexperience exacerbated the biases of his advisers, whereas
   his father's experience cast a long shadow over many of the same
   officials. Understanding the experience and biases of any one individual
   is insufficient-the balance of experience within a group is also
   important. Experience is therefore not fungible: a seasoned team cannot
   substitute for an experienced leader.

AB A prominent explanation of war claims that international conflict can
   result when shifts in bargaining power induce the declining power to
   behave aggressively today because the rising power cannot credibly
   commit to not behave aggressively tomorrow. This paper asks whether
   individuals respond to shifting power in ways assumed by these models.
   Rather than use abstract laboratory-based bargaining games as in other
   work, I use vignettes describing the United States in an international
   bargaining situation to explore the microfoundations of power
   transitions models empirically. The vignettes vary whether the
   individual is a member of a declining or a rising power and whether
   there are previous public commitments to the status quo division of
   territory. Subjects propose a response the United States should make and
   then explain their decision in their own words. I apply new methods for
   analyzing these open-ended responses. Consistent with predictions from
   the behavioral literature, I find important asymmetries in behavior
   across these conditions as well as substantial heterogeneities in
   individuals' motivations for their decisions. The results of the
   experiments suggest potential ways that power-transition models should
   be refined to have a firmer behavioral basis.

   central benefits of this under-utilized approach from a perspective
   uncommon in the existing literature: we focus on how predictive modeling
   can be used to complement and augment standard associational analyses.
   Second, we advance the state of the literature by laying out a simple

AB Over the past decade, a number of new measures have been developed that
   attempt to capture the political orientation of both incumbent and
   nonincumbent candidates for Congress, as well as other offices, on the
   same scale. These measures pose the possibility of being able to answer
   a host of fundamental questions about political accountability and
   representation. In this paper, we examine the properties of six recent
   measures of candidates' political orientations in different domains.
   While these measures are commonly viewed as proxies for ideology, each
   involves very different choices, incentives, and contexts. Indeed, we
   show that there is only a weak relationship between these measures
   within party. This suggests that these measures are capturing
   domain-specific factors rather than just candidates' ideology. Moreover,
   these measures do poorly at distinguishing between moderate and extreme
   roll call voting records within each party. As a result, they fall short
   when it comes to facilitating empirical analysis of theories of
   accountability and representation in Congress. Overall, our findings
   suggest that future research should leverage the conceptual and
   empirical variation across these measures and avoid assuming they are
   synonymous with candidates' ideology.

   using existing frequency-based methods, allowing for the analysis of

   regression context, whether survey respondents provide one response to a

   reveal that belief openly in response to a direct question. As an
   empirical application, the method is applied to an original large-scale

AB Do natural disasters help or hurt politicians' electoral fortunes?
   Research on this question has produced conflicting results. Achen and
   Bartels (2 0 0 2, 2 0 1 6) find that voters punish incumbent politicians
   indiscriminately after such disasters. Other studies find that voters
   incorporate the quality of relief efforts by elected officials. We argue
   that results in this literature may be driven, in part, by a focus on
   contemporary cases of disaster and relief. In contrast, we study a case
   of catastrophic flooding in the American South in 1 9 2 7, in which
   disaster aid was broadly and fairly distributed and Herbert Hoover (the
   1 9 2 8 Republican presidential candidate) was personally responsible
   for overseeing the relief efforts. Despite the distribution of
   unprecedented levels of disaster aid, we find that voters punished
   Hoover at the polls: in affected counties, Hoover's vote share decreased
   by more than 1 0 percentage points. Our results are robust to the use of
   synthetic control methods and suggest that-even if voters distinguish
   between low-and high-quality responses-the aggregate effect of this
   disaster remains broadly negative. Our findings provide some support for
   Achen and Bartels' idea of blind retrospection, but also generate
   questions about the precise mechanisms by which damage and relief affect

   on the concept of risk inherent in the Breen-Goldthorpe model of

   to downward mobility-this article estimates the risk of university
   dropout in terms of future labour market exclusion, where dropouts are
   compared to never entrants of tertiary education. To rule out unobserved
   differences between the groups, sibling fixed effects are paired with
   controls for ability, non-cognitive skills, and life course events. The

AB Support for radical right parties has grown rapidly in many Western
   countries over the past few decades. In recent years, many studies have
   addressed the relationship between the presence of ethnic minorities in
   people's living environment and their support for a radical right party,
   but consensus is hard to find as to how ethnic minority density is
   related to support for the radical right, let alone why. In this
   contribution, we demonstrate that in The Netherlands, ethnic minority
   density is positively related to the likelihood to vote for the Party
   for Freedom. This is particularly the case when the size of the minority
   group exceeds 15 per cent of the total neighbourhood population. We
   could establish this relationship by using the Dutch 1Vandaag Opinion
   Panel data set, a unique large-scale, individual-level data set
   comprising 21,200 native Dutch respondents living in 3,068 different
   neighbourhoods. We enriched this data set with contextual information
   derived from Statistics Netherlands. The reason why ethnic minority
   density is linked to support for the radical right is that these
   residents see non-Western migrants as a threat for their neighbourhood.
   This is particularly true for residents who do not mingle with their
   non-coethnic neighbours.

AB How does labour market insecurity influence generalized social trust?
   And what role does the welfare state play in moderating this
   relationship? While the widespread impact of labour market insecurity
   has become increasingly recognized, its effect on workers' social
   attitudes remains under-explored. In particular, little is known about
   the influence that job insecurity has on generalized social trust.
   Understanding the relationship between employment insecurity and social
   trust is important not only because reductions in trust can have
   important downstream consequences, but also because trust is in itself
   an important resource for dealing with periods of uncertainty.
   Investigating the relationship between labour market insecurity and
   trust also opens up a new perspective on the relationship between
   welfare states and trust. Social policies such as unemployment benefits
   and active labour market policies insulate workers from the effects of
   insecurity, lessening the effect of insecurity on trust. The interaction
   between individual insecurity, national unemployment support, and social
   trust attitudes thus provides a new perspective on the often posited
   link between trust and welfare states. Using multi-level modelling, this
   article addresses both questions directly. Combining data from the first
   six waves of the European Social Survey with measures of workers' labour
   market insecurity, this article demonstrates that labour market
   insecurity does has a strong and persistent negative effect on social
   trust. Moreover, by embedding individual workers in national contexts,
   this article also shows that social policy can play an important role in

AB In the United Kingdom, new sources of administrative social science data
   are unfolding rapidly but the quality of these new forms of data for
   sociological research is yet to be established. We investigate the
   quality and consistency of the parental occupational information that is
   officially recorded on administrative birth records by undertaking a
   comparison with information collected from the same parents in the UK
   Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). We detect a large amount of missing
   information in the birth records and a range of inconsistencies. We
   present an empirical analysis of MCS data using parental social class
   measures derived both from the birth records and the survey to assess
   the effects of these discrepancies. We conclude that parental
   occupational information from administrative birth records should not be
   assumed, a priori, to be suitable for sociological analyses and that
   further research should be undertaken into their consistency and
   accuracy.

AB This article investigates how employers interpret participation in
   labour market programmes when assessing job candidates. We hypothesize
   that employers use programme participation to sort applicants. On the
   basis of a factorial survey experiment, we simulated the recruitment
   process for two positions requiring different skills in the hotel
   sector. Recruiters were asked to evaluate fictitious candidates who
   differ in their participation in active labour market programmes. Our
   results show that employers take programme participation into account
   when assessing a candidate. Its impact can be positive or negative
   depending on the candidate's distance from the labour market. Candidates
   more distant from the labour market are evaluated better if they have
   participated in a programme. For stronger candidates, instead,
   participation can act as a stigma and worsen the assessment made by the
   recruiter.

AB In this article we pursue, using appropriate British birth cohort data,
   various issues that arise from recent research into the 'direct' effect
   of social origins on individuals' social mobility chances: i.e. the
   effect that is not mediated by education and that can be seen as giving
   rise to non-meritocratic 'glass floors' and 'glass ceilings'. We show
   that if educational level is determined at labour market entry, class
   destinations are significantly associated with class origins
   independently of education. However, we go on to investigate how far the
   direct effect may be underestimated by an insufficiently comprehensive
   treatment of social origins, and also how far it may be overestimated by
   a failure to take into account the effects of later-life education and
   resulting changes in individuals' relative qualification levels.
   Finally, having arrived at our best estimates of the extent of the
   direct effect, we seek to identify factors that mediate it. While
   individuals' cognitive ability and sense of locus of control prove to
   play some part, reported parental help in the labour market does not
   appear to be of any great importance. Some implications of our findings
   both for further research and for the ideal of an education-based
   meritocracy are considered.

AB This study describes the association between having children and the
   risk of union disruption, and whether this association has changed over
   time. We expand upon previous research by including data on cohabiting
   as well as married couples, and by studying change over four decades. We
   use data from the Norwegian Gender and Generation Study (2007) (N =
   14,892). Combining self-reported union histories with register data on
   fertility histories, we construct a data set of person months for all
   individuals at risk of union dissolution in the period 1970-2007.
   Results from the event history analysis confirm that couples with
   children have lower union dissolution risk. Union dissolution risk is
   lowest when children are young, and also varies by number of children.
   There is little change over historical time in the correlation between
   having children and the risk of union dissolution. However, the monthly
   risk of dissolving unions increases substantially over time among
   childless as well as parental couples.

AB Neighbourhoods with high ethnic concentrations are argued to steer
   immigrants into lives separate from the native population. Taking
   adolescent immigrants in Germany as an example, this article argues and
   shows why the link between the ethnic composition of immigrants'
   neighbourhoods and their friendships depends on immigrants'
   socio-economic status (i.e. SES-specific neighbourhood effects on
   interethnic friendships); why high-SES immigrants living around more
   natives have more native friends, whereas for low-SES immigrants, this
   association is weaker. Introducing a formal account of interethnic
   friendship formation, the article proposes four potential explanations,
   three being empirically corroborated. First, SES differences are partly
   an artefact because of model misspecification. Second, low-SES
   immigrants attend more concentrated meeting contexts (i.e. schools) than
   high-SES immigrants, yielding different opportunities for native friends
   even when neighbourhood compositions are identical. Third, SES-specific
   friendship preferences may also be responsible. There is no indication
   that SES groups differ in how much they rely on their neighbourhoods
   when making friends. Additional analyses conducted on adolescent
   immigrants in the Netherlands confirm these patterns. All presented
   analyses make use of ego-network data from the first wave of the CILS4EU
   data, accompanied by small-scale neighbourhood information from an
   external data source.

AB This article investigates associations between couples' divisions of
   time spent on employment and household chores and respondents'
   satisfaction with their partner relationship. Theoretical notions of
   specialization and equity were used to derive hypotheses. Specialization
   relates to differentiation in the content of tasks, whereas equity in
   hours indicates similarity in time devoted to family needs. We study
   direct effects of hours-equity and specialization with relationship
   satisfaction, but more importantly we investigate to what extent
   associations differ for people with egalitarian gender role attitudes,
   and for people with young children. We analysed dyadic data from the
   British Household Panel Survey. Surprisingly, no main effects of
   hours-equity and specialization on relationship satisfaction were found.
   Our results did show that for men with egalitarian gender role
   attitudes, equity in hours positively affected relationship
   satisfaction. Moreover, specialization was related to lower relationship
   satisfaction for men with egalitarian gender role attitudes. Conditional
   effects were not found for women or for the presence of children.

AB In Europe, almost half of all jobs are found through personal contacts
   such as colleagues, family, or friends. We analyse whether personal
   contacts facilitate access to jobs for the middle or the working class.
   We do not treat informal ties as a homogeneous category, but distinguish
   work-related contacts from communal contacts such as family, friends,
   and acquaintances. Our analysis is based on a longitudinal survey of
   unemployed jobseekers in Switzerland that we match with administrative
   data. We find that work-related ties are disproportionately used by
   individuals with favourable employment prospects: middle-aged jobseekers
   with high prior earnings. In contrast, communal contacts chiefly help
   jobseekers with poor employability, notably the low-skilled working
   class and workers dismissed for non-economic reasons. Communal contacts
   thus compensate for the difficulty of finding a job through other
   channels. However, the different search methods do not affect how wages
   evolve from pre- to post-unemployment jobs. The unemployed who found a
   job via communal ties were earning less than those using a work tie or a
   formal method to begin with.

AB Although structural determinants have been emphasized for explaining
   wage differences between men and women, the role of regional opportunity
   structures still warrants research. This investigation focuses on the
   relevance of urban labour markets and agglomeration effects for the
   spatial variation in the gender wage gap and provides comprehensive
   insights into the underlying mechanisms by combining sociological,
   economic, and geographical approaches. It is argued that partnership
   ties impose severe restrictions on women's labour mobility, confining
   them to the labour markets of their partners and the local conditions of
   their residential area. According to labour market theory, women's lower
   responsiveness to better job offers will translate into lower earnings.
   However, the size of the wage penalty varies with urban size and will be
   considerably lower in large labour markets. Empirical evidence is
   provided using data from the German Socio-economic Panel (1992-2012).
   Methodologically, the study adds to the literature by estimating hybrid,
   within- and between-effect wage regressions that also take into account
   dynamic selection into employment. Results indicate that male-female
   wage differentials narrow with urban size up to 9 per cent, thereby
   prompting the increasingly discussed importance of agglomeration effects
   for women's employment outcomes. Moreover, the study reveals and
   discusses pitfalls in interpreting results from fixed-effects models.

   toward narratives, whether factual or not, to justify ongoing actions,
   even such basic actions as spending and investing. Stories motivate and
   connect activities to deeply felt values and needs. Narratives "go
   viral" and spread far, even worldwide, with economic impact. The
   1920-1921 Depression, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the so-called
   Great Recession of 2007-2009, and the contentious political-economic
   situation of today are considered as the results of the popular
   narratives of their respective times. Though these narratives are deeply
   human phenomena that are difficult to study in a scientific manner,
   quantitative analysis may help us gain a better understanding of these

   Previous research highlights that some form of ideological compromise on

   which to measure such presidential give-and-take, the extent to which
   presidents make use of such policy compromise, and under what conditions
   this is a viable strategy, remains unknown. Applying quantitative text
   analysis to 305 annual state of the union addresses of 73 presidents in
   13 Latin American countries, we remedy this situation and provide
   comparable time-series data for Latin American presidential movements in
   a one-dimensional issue space between 1980 and 2014. Our results
   indicate that presidents will compromise in response to changes in the
   median party, although this effect will be mediated by the institutional
   context within which the president operates.

AB Where organized religion begins, democratic rights end. Or so it is
   often assumed. Traditionally, most political philosophers have agreed
   that democratic norms should not directly regulate the internal
   governance of nonpolitical organizations. And while a growing number of
   scholars have recently argued in favor of democratizing some
   nonpolitical organizations, most notably business firms, religious
   associations continue to be regarded as paradigmatic cases of
   democracy-free zones. Contrary to this view, I defend a pro tanto right
   to democracy within large and hierarchical churches. I then explain
   that, once appropriately qualified, this right is not overruled by
   claims to freedom of religious association and church autonomy. Testing
   the extension of democratic rights to churches provides an opportunity
   to tackle, at once, a series of broader normative issues, including the
   scope of democracy below the state, the limits of freedom of
   association, and the putatively special status of religion.

   combining data from a new survey of over 2,800 in- and out-of-state
   donors associated with the 2012 Senate elections, FEC data on
   contributors' professions, and legislative records. Three major findings
   emerge. First, policy agreement between a donor's positions and a
   senator's roll calls significantly influences the likelihood of giving,
   even for same-party contributors. Second, there is a significant effect
   of committee membership corresponding to a donor's occupation; this
   holds even for donors who claim that other motivations dominate, but it
   does not appear to be motivated by an expectation of access. Third,
   conditional upon a donation occurring, its size is determined by factors

AB This article develops a theory of the administration and effectiveness
   of government programs. In the model, a bureaucrat chooses a mechanism
   for assigning a good to clients with uncertain qualifications. The
   mechanism applies a costly means test to verify the client's
   eligibility. A politician exercises oversight by limiting the
   bureaucrat's testing resources and the number of clients to be served.
   The model predicts the incidence of common administrative pathologies,
   including inefficient and politicized distribution of resources,
   inflexibility, program errors, and backlogs. When the politician favors
   marginally qualified clients, per capita spending is low and error rates
   are high. When the politician favors highly qualified clients, per
   capita spending is higher and error rates are lower. In the latter case,
   the bureaucrat may also use discriminatory testing, which allows the
   politician to target favored clients. Such targeted programs increase
   budgets and reduce backlogs, but they also increase error rates.

AB It has long been observed that centralized social control requires some
   level of cooperation from the populace. Without such assistance, control
   agents are unable to acquire the local knowledge necessary to locate and
   prosecute deviants. Yet why citizens cooperate with authorities,
   especially in the most repressive regimes, remains a puzzle. This
   article develops two models of such cooperation: in the first,
   authorities actively use incentives to elicit denunciations from the
   populace, through either coercion or the promise of rewards. In the
   second, authorities passively gain access to local negative networks, as
   individuals denounce to harm others whom they dislike and to gain
   relative to them. Using internal variation in the early years of the
   Spanish Inquisition (1486 to 1502) and Romanov Russia (1613 to 1649), I
   demonstrate the differing effects of each model on patterns of
   denunciations. Paradoxically, social control is most effective when
   authorities provide individuals maximum freedom to direct its coercive
   power.

   Specifically, Chou disregards that SISTER exploits cultural variation

   identification. I argue that SISTER can comply with the IV assumptions
   precisely because it is a multiple-origin method that conceptualizes

AB There has been a remarkable shift in the relationship between market and
   state responsibilities for public services like health care and
   education. While these services continue to be financed publicly, they
   are now often provided through the market. The main argument for this
   new institutional division of labor is economic: while (public) ends
   stay the same, (private) means are more efficient. Markets function as
   mere means' under the continued responsibility of the state. This
   article investigates and rejects currently existing egalitarian liberal
   theories about this division of labor and it presents and defends a new
   theory of marketization, in which social rights and democratic
   decision-making occupy center-stage.

   with high levels of concentration in media coverage of groups, more
   extensive coverage of economic groups than citizen groups, and
   differential patterns of group appearances across policy areas and

AB The effect of new International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending
   announcements on capital markets depends on the lender's political
   motivations. There are conditions under which lending reduces the risk
   of a deepening crisis and the risk premium demanded by market actors.
   Yet the political interests that make lenders willing to lend may weaken
   the credibility of commitments to reform, and the act of accepting an
   agreement reveals unfavorable information about the state of the
   borrower's economy. The net 'catalytic' effect on the price of private
   borrowing depends on whether these effects dominate the beneficial
   effects of the liquidity the loan provides. Decomposing the
   contradictory effects of crisis lending provides an explanation for the
   discrepant empirical findings in the literature about market reactions.
   This study tests the implications of the theory by examining how
   sovereign bond yields are affected by IMF program announcements, loan
   size, the scope of conditions attached to loans and measures of the
   geopolitical interests of the United States, a key IMF principal.

AB Voters in US elections receive markedly different representation
   depending on which candidate they elect, and because of incumbent
   advantages, the effects of this choice persist for many years. What are
   the long-term consequences of these two phenomena? Combining electoral
   and legislative roll-call data in a dynamic regression discontinuity
   design, this study assesses the long-term consequences of election
   results for representation. Across the US House, the US Senate and state
   legislatures, the effects of 'coin-flip' elections persist for at least
   a decade in all settings, and for as long as three decades in some.
   Further results suggest that elected officials do not adapt their

   reveals that the impact of ethnic diversity and electoral systems on the

   this study reveals that ethnic diversity spurs party proliferation in
   countries with both majoritarian and proportional electoral systems,
   though the effect is stronger in the latter. The insights gained here
   provide a theoretically derived measure of ethnic diversity that is
   useful for estimating its effect on specifically political phenomena and
   generating an improved holistic measure of the impact of electoral
   systems. More crucially, the results indicate that electoral system
   designers have a greater capacity to structure electoral outcomes. The

AB Why do political parties join coalitions to support other parties'
   presidential candidates if presidents, once elected, are not bound to
   their pre-electoral pledges? This article argues that policy agreements
   made publicly between coalition partners during the campaign help
   parties pursue policy goals. However, parties cannot use pre-electoral
   coalitions to secure access to patronage, pork and government benefits
   under the control of presidents because they cannot hold presidents
   accountable to these agreements. Quantitative analysis of Latin American
   electoral coalitions demonstrates that political parties are more likely
   to form presidential electoral coalitions as the ideological distance
   between them decreases. Yet presidential electoral coalitions tend not
   to include non-programmatic political parties, even though such
   office-oriented parties are unconstrained by ideological considerations.

AB This article examines the relationship between candidate names as they
   appear on the ballot paper and voting patterns in British local
   elections. Specifically, it explores whether some voters favour
   candidates with British-sounding names over those whose names suggest
   either European or non-European ethnic origins. Name classification
   software identifies three categories of candidate: British, other
   European and non-European. Separate analyses of aggregate voting data
   are undertaken of multi-member and single-member electoral districts.
   Data cover the period 1973-2012, and votes for more than 400,000
   candidates are examined. In multi-member districts, after comparing
   within-party slates and finishing order generally, candidates whose
   surnames suggest a British ethnic origin perform best, while
   non-Europeans attract fewer votes. The analysis of single-member
   districts focuses on a party's vote share after taking into account the
   pattern of candidate recruitment across electoral cycles. It shows that
   vote share is adversely affected when British candidates are replaced by
   those with European and non-European surnames, while the opposite
   pattern of succession is associated with a boost in votes. It is clear
   that the outcome of some elections has been determined by the parties'
   choice of candidates.

AB The notion that cultural characteristics influence political regimes
   remains popular, despite mixed supporting evidence. In particular,
   democracy is argued to emerge and thrive in countries where liberal or
   freedom-oriented values (so-called self-expression values) are
   widespread. Inglehart and Welzel, for instance, report such an effect,
   mainly drawing inferences from cross-country comparisons. Yet
   cross-country correlations between self-expression values and democracy
   could stem from different processes. Reinvestigating this relationship,
   this article finds no empirical support when employing models accounting
   for sample-selection bias, country-specific effects and the endogeneity
   of values to democracy. Self-expression values do not enhance democracy
   levels or democratization chances, and neither do they stabilize
   existing democracies. In contrast, this study finds indications that a
   country's experience with democracy enhances self-expression values.

AB In this issue, Dahlum and Knutsen (D&K) claim to disprove the
   emancipatory theory of democracy proposed by Inglehart and Welzel (I&W).
   1 This theory posits that rising emphasis on universal freedoms, or what
   I&W call 'emancipative values', is a major force driving the emergence
   and survival of democracy.
   To support their claim, D&K impute country scores to emancipative values
   for years in which real data are absent. 2 These imputations allow them
   to produce a time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) database, consisting of
   some 2,000 country-year observations. 3 Running panel regressions over
   these data, D&K find that a population's emphasis on emancipative values
   in a given year has no effect on its level of democracy in the next
   year. D&K believe that this result invalidates I&W's theory, in which
   case the values of a population are irrelevant for whether it attains
   and sustains democracy.
   We appreciate this contribution because it provides a welcome
   opportunity to pinpoint some pitfalls of TSCS frameworks. To do so, we
   proceed in three steps. First, we describe the problem with TSCS data in
   conceptual terms; then we illustrate the problem with a simulation;
   finally we demonstrate what real data say about I&W's theory. We
   conclude that the evidence supports the emancipatory theory of democracy
   as powerfully as it did in I&W's original analyses.

AB The formal institutional constraints that Congress and the courts impose
   on presidential unilateral action are feeble. As a result, recent
   scholarship suggests that public opinion may be the strongest check
   against executive overreach. However, little is known about how the
   public assesses unilateral action. Through a series of five survey
   experiments embedded in nationally representative surveys, we examine
   the extent to which Americans evaluate unilateral action based on
   constitutional, partisan, and policy concerns. We find that Americans do
   not instinctively reject unilateral action as a threat to our system of
   checks and balances, but instead evaluate unilateral action in terms of
   whether it accords or conflicts with their partisan and policy
   preference priors. Our results suggest that the public constraint on
   presidential unilateral action is far from automatic. Rather, the
   strength and scope of this check are variable products of political
   contestation in the public sphere.

AB We propose a simplified approach to matching for causal inference that

   the matched sample size and maximize balance or fix balance and maximize
   sample size, leaving analysts to settle for suboptimal solutions or
   attempt manual optimization by iteratively tweaking their matching
   method and rechecking balance. To jointly maximize balance and sample
   size, we introduce the matching frontier, the set of matching solutions
   with maximum possible balance for each sample size. Rather than
   iterating, researchers can choose matching solutions from the frontier
   for analysis in one step. We derive fast algorithms that calculate the
   matching frontier for several commonly used balance metrics. We
   demonstrate this approach with analyses of the effect of sex on judging
   and job training programs that show how the methods we introduce can

AB This article examines housing insecurity within manufactured housing-the
   single largest source of unsubsidized affordable housing in the United
   States, home to about 18 million low-income residents. A large portion
   of manufactured housing is installed in mobile home parks, which can
   legally close at any time, displacing entire communities. Based on two
   years living within and being evicted from closing mobile home parks in
   two states, this comparative ethnography of mass eviction juxtaposes
   sites of distinctive state practices for managing the forced relocation
   of park residents. I analyze the experience of eviction in Florida, a
   site of explicit intervention and "model" legislation for mobile home
   park closures, in light of the experience in Texas, where the state has
   adopted a hands-off approach. I describe the paradoxical effects of
   Florida's protective, yet market-oriented, state housing interventions,
   which produced both a cottage industry of mobile home relocation
   services and a more protracted, pernicious eviction for displaced
   residents. I outline the specific mechanisms through which this paradox
   of state intervention occurred and consider the implications not only
   for mobile home parks but also for a variety of other state programs
   that are currently being delivered through an adaptive reliance on the
   private sector.

AB While poor families experience high residential instability, they also
   stay put for extended periods of time before moving. When they do move,
   they are likely to move laterally to a similarly disadvantaged place.
   These two processes-staying in place and churning-amount to "horizontal
   immobility." Why do people get stuck in disadvantaged environments?
   Prevailing understandings focus on constraints to residential choice,
   but even under limitations, families make active residential decisions.
   Drawing on fieldwork with 50 renters in a low-income, high-crime
   Baltimore neighborhood, this article proposes that neighborhoods
   themselves shape narratives governing residential decision-making. In
   high-crime neighborhoods, renters stay put as long as they can craft a
   story that justifies remaining. But when the narrative is ruptured by
   violent events, residents are pushed to action, often a move. The logic
   behind these moves is motivated by a desire to restore a sense of
   safety. The concept of "narrative rupture" sheds light on when a family
   decides to move, representing a mechanism for how residential decisions
   are shaped by neighborhood forces to reproduce poverty. This concept
   also contributes to theories of how culture shapes action: we are most
   likely to act when the narratives supporting our current course of
   action break down.

AB A core claim of sociological theory is that modern institutions fall
   short of their meritocratic ideals, whereby rewards should be allocated
   based on achievement-related criteria. Instead, high-status actors often
   experience a "status advantage": they are rewarded disproportionately to
   the quality of their performance. We develop and test a theory of status
   advantage in meritocratic settings. The most influential model in past
   research derives status advantage from decision-makers' tendency to
   infer quality from status when quality is uncertain. The theory
   developed here integrates and extends this and other theories to explain
   the emergence of status advantage in the many meritocratic contexts
   where the decision-maker's personal, first-order sense of quality is
   less important to the decision. We argue that in such contexts,
   decision-makers must often coordinate with others to make the "best"
   decision, and thus they focus on the "third-order inference" problem of
   discerning who or what "most people" think is higher quality, as encoded
   in status beliefs. Three experiments demonstrate that under such
   conditions, status advantages can emerge even though (1) status
   information does not resolve uncertainty about quality; (2) the status
   belief is illegitimate; and (3) no party to the decision personally
   prefers the higher-status option. The theory implies that status
   hierarchies are resilient in the face of significant dissent but may be
   subject to public challenge.

AB How do public opinion signals affect political representatives' opinion
   formation? To date, we have only limited knowledge about this essential
   representative process. In this article, we theorize and examine the
   signaling strength of one type of societal signal: protest. We do so by
   means of an innovative experiment conducted among Belgian national and
   regional politicians. Elected officials were exposed to manipulated
   television news items covering a protest demonstration. Following
   Tilly's previously untested WUNC claim, four features of the event were
   manipulated: the demonstrators' worthiness, unity, numerical strength,
   and commitment. We argue that these protest features present elected
   officials with useful cues about what (a segment of) the public wants.
   We find that these cues affect elected officials' beliefs. The salience
   they attach to the protest issue, the position they take, and their
   intended actions all change as a consequence of exposure. The size of a
   protest event (numbers) and whether the protesters agree among
   themselves (unity) are the most persuasive protest factors. The effects
   of the protest signals come on top of strong receiver effects. We find
   no evidence that elected officials' predispositions moderate the effects
   of the protest features.

AB A long line of research documents the essential role of social networks
   in mediating the recruitment and retention of members in organizations.
   But organizations also comprise a primary context where people form
   social ties. We investigate how the network structure an organization
   creates among its members influences its ability to grow and reproduce.
   In particular, we propose that two dimensions of organizational strategy
   influence affiliation dynamics: (1) the extent to which an organization
   induces social interaction among its members (social encapsulation), and
   (2) the time and energy that an organization demands of its members
   (time and energy demand). We examine membership dynamics in an ecology
   where competitor organizations deploying varied strategies vie for the
   same pool of members. Results show a curvilinear relationship between
   membership growth and the rate of social encapsulation. Furthermore, we
   find that time and energy demand mediates the effect of social
   encapsulation by shaping its members' opportunities for maintaining
   external affiliations. Different opportunity structures result in
   different levels of network turnover, thus either reinforcing or
   dissolving intra-organizational ties. For most types of organizations,
   attaining sustained growth requires a balance between open networks (for
   recruitment) and network closure (for retention).

AB This article explores belief in political rumors surrounding the health
   care reforms enacted by Congress in 2010. Refuting rumors with
   statements from unlikely sources can, under certain circumstances,
   increase the willingness of citizens to reject rumors regardless of
   their own political predilections. Such source credibility effects,
   while well known in the political persuasion literature, have not been
   applied to the study of rumor. Though source credibility appears to be
   an effective tool for debunking political rumors, risks remain. Drawing
   upon research from psychology on 'fluency' - the ease of information
   recall - this article argues that rumors acquire power through
   familiarity. Attempting to quash rumors through direct refutation may
   facilitate their diffusion by increasing fluency. The empirical results
   find that merely repeating a rumor increases its power.

AB Despite the prevalence of anti-government rumors in authoritarian
   countries, little is currently known about their effects on citizens'
   attitudes toward the government, and whether the authorities can
   effectively combat rumors. With an experimental procedure embedded in
   two surveys about Chinese internet users' information exposure, this
   study finds that rumors decrease citizens' trust in the government and
   support of the regime. Moreover, individuals from diverse socio-economic
   and political backgrounds are similarly susceptible to thinly evidenced
   rumors. Rebuttals generally reduce people's belief in the specific
   content of rumors, but often do not recover political trust unless the
   government brings forth solid and vivid evidence to back its refutation
   or win the endorsement of public figures broadly perceived to be
   independent. But because such high-quality and strong rebuttals are hard
   to come by, rumors will erode political support in an authoritarian
   state. These findings have rich implications for studies of rumors and
   misinformation in general, and authoritarian information politics in
   particular.

AB Sociology traditionally accounts for eating in terms of the social
   organization of meals, their provision and consumption. A recurrent
   public concern is that the meal is being subverted. This paper examines
   meal arrangements in British households in 2012, drawing on an online
   survey in the format of a food diary administered to 2784 members of a
   supermarket consumer panel. It charts the organization of contemporary
   eating occasions, paying attention to socio-demographic variation in
   practice. Especially, it explores companionless meals, putting them in
   contexts of food provisioning and temporal rhythms. Findings show that
   eating alone is associated with simpler, quicker meals, and that it
   takes place most commonly in the morning and midday. Those living alone
   eat alone more often, but at similar meal times, and they take longer
   over their lone meals. Comparison with a similar study in 1955-6
   suggests some fragmentation or relaxation in collective schedules. The
   implications are not straightforward, and the causes probably lie more
   in institutional shifts than personal preferences. Declining levels of
   commensality are, however, associated with a reduction in household size
   and, especially in households with children, difficulties of
   coordinating family members' schedules.

AB This review examines several recent books that deal with the impact of

   predict that the current phase of digital technology will create massive
   job loss in an unprecedented way, that is, that this wave of automation
   is different from previous waves. Uniquely digital technology is said to
   automate professional occupations for the first time. This review
   critically examines these claims, puncturing some of the hyperbole about
   automation, robotics and Artificial Intelligence. The review argues for
   a more nuanced analysis of the politics of technology and provides some
   critical distance on Silicon Valley's futurist discourse. Only by
   insisting that futures are always social can public bodies, rather than
   autonomous markets and endogenous technologies, become central to
   disentangling, debating and delivering those futures.

AB This paper empirically investigates how sentences to be assigned at

   bargaining with asymmetric information by Bebchuk (1984). I provide
   conditions for the nonparametric identification of the model, propose a
   consistent nonparametric estimator, and implement it using data on
   criminal cases from North Carolina. Employing the estimated model, I
   evaluate how different sentencing reforms affect the outcome of criminal
   cases. My results indicate that lower mandatory minimum sentences could
   greatly reduce the total amount of incarceration time assigned by the
   courts, but may increase conviction rates. In contrast, the broader use
   of non-incarceration sentences for less serious crimes reduces the
   number of incarceration convictions, but has a very small effect over
   the total assigned incarceration time. I also consider the effects of a
   ban on plea bargains. Depending on the case characteristics, over 20
   percent of the defendants who currently receive incarceration sentences
   would be acquitted if plea bargains were forbidden.

AB The impact of insurer competition on welfare, negotiated provider
   prices, and premiums in the U.S. private health care industry is
   theoretically ambiguous. Reduced competition may increase the premiums
   charged by insurers and their payments made to hospitals. However, it
   may also strengthen insurers' bargaining leverage when negotiating with
   hospitals, thereby generating offsetting cost decreases. To understand
   and measure this trade-off, we estimate a model of employer-insurer and
   hospital-insurer bargaining over premiums and reimbursements, household
   demand for insurance, and individual demand for hospitals using detailed
   California admissions, claims, and enrollment data. We simulate the
   removal of both large and small insurers from consumers' choice sets.
   Although consumer welfare decreases and premiums typically increase, we
   find that premiums can fall upon the removal of a small insurer if an
   employer imposes effective premium constraints through negotiations with
   the remaining insurers. We also document substantial heterogeneity in
   hospital price adjustments upon the removal of an insurer, with
   renegotiated price increases and decreases of as much as 10% across
   markets.

   varies stochastically over time. Under some conditions including no
   entry, an anti-folk theorem holds: when firms are patient, so that
   strength levels change relatively quickly, every Nash equilibrium
   involves an immediate price war that lasts until at most one firm
   remains. Surprisingly, the possibility of entry may facilitate

AB We consider forecasting with uncertainty about the choice of predictor

   investigate the distributional properties of a number of different
   schemes for model choice and parameter estimation, including: in-sample
   model selection using the Akaike information criterion; out-of-sample
   model selection; and splitting the data into subsamples for model
   selection and parameter estimation. Using a weak-predictor local
   asymptotic scheme, we provide a representation result that facilitates
   comparison of the distributional properties of the procedures and their
   associated forecast risks. This representation isolates the source of
   inefficiency in some of these procedures. We develop a simulation

   asymptotic risk of the estimators and their associated forecasts.
   Numerically, we find that for many values of the local parameter, the
   out-of-sample and split-sample schemes perform poorly if implemented in
   the conventional way. But they perform well, if implemented in
   conjunction with our risk-reduction method or bagging.

AB Limited overlap between the covariate distributions of groups with
   different treatment assignments does not only make estimates of average
   treatment effects rather imprecise, but can also lead to substantially
   distorted confidence intervals. This paper argues that this is because
   the coverage error of traditional confidence intervals is driven by the
   number of observations in the areas of limited overlap. Some of these
   "local sample sizes" can be very small in applications, up to the point
   that distributional approximations derived from classical asymptotic
   theory become unreliable. Building on this observation, this paper
   constructs confidence intervals based on classical approaches to small
   sample inference. The approach is easy to implement, and has superior
   theoretical and practical properties relative to standard methods in
   empirically relevant settings.

   We consider a robust version of the principal's problem, in which she

   its worst-case expected profit, over all joint distributions consistent

AB This paper develops a theory of socially determined aspirations, and the

   interaction is bidirectional: economy-wide outcomes determine individual
   aspirations, which in turn determine investment incentives and social
   outcomes. Thus aspirations, income, and the distribution of income
   evolve jointly. When capital stocks lie in some compact set, steady
   state distributions must exhibit inequality and are typically clustered
   around local poles. When sustained growth is possible, initial histories
   matter. Either there is convergence to an equal distribution (with
   growth) or there is perennial relative divergence across clusters, with
   within-cluster convergence. A central feature that drives these results
   is that aspirations that are moderately above an individual's current
   standard of living tend to encourage investment, while still higher
   aspirations may lead to frustration.

AB Persistent school segregation may allow advantaged groups to hoard
   educational opportunities and consign minority students to lower-quality
   educational experiences. Although minority students are concentrated in
   low-achieving schools, relatively little previous research directly
   links segregation to measures of school quality based on student
   achievement growth, which more plausibly reflect learning opportunities.
   Using a dataset of public elementary schools in California, this study
   provides the first analysis detailing the distribution of a growth-based
   measure of school quality using standard inequality indices, allowing
   disparities to be decomposed across geographic and organizational
   scales. We find mixed support for the school opportunity hoarding
   hypothesis. We find small White and Asian advantages in access to
   high-growth schools, but most of the inequality in exposure to school
   growth is within racial groups. Growth-based disparities both between
   and within groups tend to be on a more local scale than disparities in
   absolute achievement levels, focusing attention on within-district
   policies to mitigate school-based inequalities in opportunities to
   learn.

AB This study adjudicates between two competing perspectives regarding the
   importance of manufacturing employment for economic growth with the
   onset of the most recent round of economic globalization. Established
   economic theories link shifts toward industrial activities to higher
   growth due to increases in aggregate productivity. While some scholars
   argue that the global restructuring of manufacturing in the era of
   globalization presents novel opportunities for development in the South,
   others suggest that the importance of manufacturing employment for
   economic growth in less developed countries declines during this period
   as competitive pressures increase and barriers to entry decline. I use
   difference models and a broad sample of both developed and less
   developed countries in the time period 1970-2010 to examine the effects
   of manufacturing share of employment on economic growth and how these
   effects have changed over time. First, I find that manufacturing
   employment has strong positive effects on economic growth net of
   neoclassical controls for all countries. Second, I find that for less
   developed countries, the importance of manufacturing share of employment
   for growth has declined through the course of the time period studied,
   particularly after 1990. In contrast, my results do not show a similar
   decline for developed countries. These findings are robust across
   alternative estimation strategies. I conclude by considering the
   theoretical implications of these results.

   on four aspects of sex laws, 1965 to 2005: (1) maximum prison terms for
   rape, (2) ages of sexual consent, (3) the existence of sodomy
   prohibitions, and (4) gender neutrality in adultery regulations. Our

   women in society-play lesser roles in explaining formal content
   differences. In supplementary analyses, we explore counterpoint
   variations, that is, sex-law reforms that flout global standards,
   illustrated here by sodomy-law expansions during the period. We find
   exogenous imprints even in these cases.

AB This paper studies how socioeconomic attainments of parents in intact
   two-parent families, non-residential parents, single parents, and
   parents in stepfamilies affect children's attainments. In doing so, we
   draw together two lines of research: one on the inheritance of social
   status that consistently reports that children benefit from greater
   maternal and paternal resources, and another on family instability that
   argues that parental separation is associated with children's lower
   socioeconomic achievement in adulthood. The analyses are based on
   Finnish Census Panel data and sibling models, and socioeconomic statuses
   are measured by occupation-based ISEI scores. The results suggest that
   in terms of socioeconomic inheritance, fathers are replaceable: the
   influence of a non-residential father was very weak and was compensated
   by the strengthened effect of the single mother and by the further
   strong influence of a stepfather. The socioeconomic status of
   non-residential mothers and stepmothers contributed very little to a
   child's status. The socioeconomic attainments of children who had lived
   in single-parent families were lower than those of children who had been
   raised in intact two-parent families, but the differences were modest
   and varied with parental status. In absolute terms, the outcomes were
   poorest for children who lived with a low-status single parent, but the
   loss associated with parental separation was greatest for those who had
   high-status non-residential fathers. The total family background effect,
   measured as sibling similarities in socioeconomic attainment, was weaker
   in single-mother families than in other family types.

AB Optimistic assessments of life chances can positively influence life
   outcomes, but conflicting theories suggest these assessments either
   reflect structural privilege or develop as a result of childhood
   hardship. In addition, competing hypotheses suggest that these
   assessments may matter differently depending on who holds them. We
   examine whether family socioeconomic status shapes adolescents'
   expectations about how successful their lives will turn out. We
   distinguish generalized life expectations (GLE), capturing anticipated
   success in life across multiple domains, from intergenerational
   comparative expectations (ICE), which register expectations about
   improvement relative to observed success within the respondent's family
   lineage. We find that adolescents from higher socioeconomic status
   families are simultaneously more optimistic about their likely success
   in life (GLE) but less likely to anticipate relative improvement in life
   success across generations (ICE). Holding high GLE in combination with
   low ICE predicted doing better in adulthood across a range of health,
   attainment, and well-being outcomes, though in most cases high GLE,
   regardless of ICE, was the key. These beneficial patterns are, for the
   most part, at least as beneficial for socioeconomically disadvantaged
   youth as they are for advantaged youth.

AB Prior research on stratification beliefs has investigated individuals'

   studies have uncovered demographic characteristics associated with
   individualist and structuralist explanations for poverty. In the current
   study, we will argue that Americans, like social scientists, envision
   poverty as a heterogeneous and complex phenomenon. We utilize a cultural
   cognition theoretical approach to conceptualize these understandings of
   poverty as schemas. We contend that a schema of poverty contains a set
   of unique associations regarding both demographic beliefs (who the poor
   are) and causal attributions (why they are poor). Using original data in
   a mixed-methods design that incorporates inductive and experimental
   components, we find that people differentiate between two key types of
   poverty: intergenerational poverty and downward mobility. People
   perceive each type of poverty as caused by a different set of factors
   and as experienced by a different group of people. The type of poverty
   envisioned is, in most cases, as important as or more important than a
   respondent's own demographic characteristics in predicting what type of
   causal attributions he or she makes for poverty. These findings
   underscore the importance of investigating different schemas of poverty
   in future stratification beliefs research.

AB American public schools experienced a substantial reduction of
   black-white segregation after the Supreme Court ordered the immediate
   desegregation of Mississippi schools in 1969. Past research has shown
   that progress slowed by the 1990s, with some arguing that segregation
   actually began to rebound. This study is the first to examine enrollment
   data for each decade between 1970 and 2010 for a comprehensive set of
   districts across the country and also the first to include data for 1980
   for a national sample of districts. It provides definitive evidence that
   most desegregation occurred in the 1970s, with little subsequent change.
   It also addresses two questions about the desegregation process. First,
   how closely was it tied to court orders for a particular school district
   or for a neighboring district? Desegregation was greatest in response to
   a legal mandate, but it also extended to districts that never faced
   court action. Second, what was the effect of mandates on white flight?
   White student enrollment declined generally in these decades but more in
   districts that faced a mandate in the immediate past decade. White
   flight contributed to a modest increase in segregation between school
   districts, but desegregation within districts was sufficient to result
   in a large net decline at a metropolitan level.

   This article draws on feminist theories of the state to analyze how the
   routine practices of low-level state bureaucrats impact women's
   experiences navigating legal institutions in urban Nicaragua. Drawing on
   ten months of ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews, I show
   how, contrary to theories of representative bureaucracy, the increased
   presence of women officials within state institutions does not improve
   most women's treatment by police or prosecutors. Rather, only when women
   have access to specific forms of social capital are their cases granted
   legitimacy by state actors. This article illustrates the routine
   practices by which gendered governance operates, as well as how feminist
   organizations disrupt patterns of bureaucratic indifference by assuming
   the banner of legitimacy that is rarely afforded to women victims
   themselves. These findings raise critical questions about the efficacy
   of traditional legal and bureaucratic strategies for eliminating

   others in local contexts generates conflict that mobilizes individuals
   to vote (mobilization theory), diminishes social cohesion that in turn
   makes voters likely to withdraw from voting (marginalization theory), or
   does not impact turnout at all. This study is one of the first to
   investigate the question using individual-level longitudinal data, which
   adds substantially to the causal leverage of the analysis. In
   particular, we use a panel dataset with validated turnout data for 1.9
   million Danish voters combined with detailed data regarding the ethnic
   composition of individuals' proximate residential neighborhood. The
   results suggest that increasing shares of immigrants does not affect
   natives' propensity to vote to any substantive extent, irrespective of

AB From town halls to public forums, disadvantaged neighborhoods appear
   more "participatory" than ever. Yet increased participation has not
   necessarily resulted in increased influence. This article, drawing on a
   four-year ethnographic study of redevelopment politics in Boston,
   presents an explanation for the decoupling of participation from the
   promise of democratic decision-making. I find that poor urban residents
   gain the appearance of power and status by invoking and policing
   membership in "the community"-a boundary sometimes, though not always,
   implicitly defined by race. But this appearance of power is largely an
   illusion. In public meetings, government officials can reinforce their
   authority and disempower residents by exploiting the fact that the
   boundary demarcating "the community" lacks a standardized definition.
   When officials laud "the community" as an abstract ideal rather than a
   specific group of people, they reduce "the community process" to a
   bureaucratic procedure. Residents appear empowered, while officials
   retain ultimate decision-making authority. I use the tools of cultural
   sociology to make sense of these findings and conclude with implications
   for the study of participatory governance and urban inequality.

   Findings also indicate that as local damages accrue over time, so does
   residential instability, net of other factors. This pattern is

AB Automobile travel is a major contributor to US greenhouse gas emissions.
   Reducing car travel could slow climate change, but this goal is made
   difficult by the constellation of economic, political, cultural, and
   infrastructural forces that form a mutually reinforcing "system of
   automobility." This complexity suggests the need for an approach that
   attends to both the reciprocal relationship between infrastructure and
   practice and the moderating influence of cultural factors, but policies
   to encourage sustainable practices rely on asocial conceptions of
   behavior. With longitudinal data on bicycle-commuting in sixty-two large
   US cities from 2000 to 2014, I use fixed-effects regression and
   structural equation modeling to perform two strong tests of whether the
   expansion of bikeway facilities induces more bicycling, and whether this
   effect depends on the strength of environmentalism in a city. I also use
   structural equation modeling to perform a preliminary test of the
   reverse causal effect-whether bicycle-commuting can spur bikeway
   creation, again allowing for a moderating effect of environmentalism. My
   results add to existing evidence that bikeways induce bicycling, and
   provide preliminary support for the reverse effect, but also indicate
   that both effects are moderated by local environmentalism. Implications
   for the persistence of auto-dominance are discussed.

AB Research on violence in US prisons frequently finds higher rates of
   violence among ethnic minorities compared to whites. Explanations focus
   on a "subculture of violence," sometimes referred to as an honor culture
   or code of the street, whereby minorities import a deeply internalized,
   violent subculture into prison. Subcultural theories of violence have
   been challenged by scholarship that views culture as providing a
   "toolkit" of frames and scripts that individuals draw upon in different
   social contexts. According to this model, the importation of violence is
   far from inevitable, because violence results from the interplay between
   social context and cultural toolkits. We assess the ability of these two
   cultural models to explain ethnic differences in prison violence in a
   different national context by comparing rates of violence among Arab
   Muslim and Jewish criminal prisoners in Israel. Subcultural models lead
   us to expect higher rates of violence among Arab Muslim prisoners, while
   a toolkit-based explanation that draws on social identity research
   predicts lower rates of violence. We test these hypotheses using both
   logistic regression and propensity score matching on data covering over
   16,000 prisoners, supplemented by in-depth interviews with prisoners and
   staff. Our results conflict with the expectations of subcultural
   theories and lend support to culture-as-toolkit explanations. We
   conclude by discussing the relevance of our findings for research on
   prison violence, theories of the relationship between culture and
   violence, and the usefulness of incorporating social identity into
   toolkit theory.

AB Residential mobility is often implicated as a risk factor for
   delinquency. While many scholars attribute this to causal processes
   spurred by moving, recent research suggests that much of the
   relationship is due to differences between mobile and non-mobile
   adolescents. However, studies in this area often operationalize mobility
   as a single move, limiting researchers to comparing outcomes between
   mobile and non-mobile adolescents. This approach is rather broad,
   considering heterogeneity in mobility frequency as well as variation in
   sending and receiving neighborhood characteristics. We propose a more
   nuanced framework to help anticipate how characteristics of mobility
   experiences may mitigate, exacerbate, or fail to influence adolescent
   behavior. Drawing on data from the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) and the National Longitudinal
   Study of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), we demonstrate that "hypermobility" has
   detrimental behavioral consequences, increases in neighborhood
   disadvantage between sending and receiving neighborhoods are associated
   with reductions in self-reported offending, and long-distance moves
   reduce delinquency,but only among adolescents with prior behavioral
   problems. These results underscore the complex association between
   residential mobility and delinquency during adolescence.

AB This article develops the concept of infrastructural exclusion as a form
   of urban inequality through the case of the origins of the food desert
   in Philadelphia. Infrastructural exclusion refers to the reorganization
   of spatial and material interdependence into a semi-autonomous and
   path-dependent force that separates resources from those reliant on
   them. Building on archival research, it emphasizes how social problems
   arise out of taken-for-granted relationships between urban development,
   population settlements, and distribution systems. Grocery chains were
   interdependent with urban neighborhoods in the early 1900s, but they
   came to participate in a fiercely competitive industry during a
   precarious period of urban decline, suburban growth, and changes in
   transportation systems. New industry conventions about profitability,
   involving higher-volume supplies and lower transaction costs, became
   embedded into the sociotechnical infrastructure. The reorganization of
   infrastructural interdependence as a semi-autonomous force constrained
   local business decision-making, led to high rates of financial
   insolvency, and contributed to the overall decline of urban grocery
   markets. This approach to infrastructural exclusion provides insights
   into the causes of a unique form of urban inequality.

AB Does the International Criminal Court's (ICC) pursuit of justice
   facilitate peace or prolong conflict? This paper addresses the "peace
   versus justice" debate by examining the ICC's impact on civil conflict
   termination. Active ICC involvement in a conflict increases the threat
   of punishment for rebel and state leaders, which, under certain
   conditions, generates incentives for these leaders to continue the
   conflict as a way to avoid capture, transfer to the Hague, and
   prosecution. The impact of ICC involvement is conditional upon the
   threat of domestic punishment that leaders face; as the risk of domestic
   punishment increases, the conflict-prolonging effects of ICC involvement
   diminish. I test these theoretical expectations on a data set of all
   civil conflict dyads from 2002 to 2013. Findings support the
   hypothesized relationship. Even after addressing potential selection and
   endogeneity concerns, I find that active involvement by the ICC
   significantly decreases the likelihood of conflict termination when the
   threat of domestic punishment is relatively low.

AB International organizations (IOs) have long been a central focus of
   scholarship in international relations, yet we know remarkably little
   about their performance. This article offers an explanation for
   differences in the performance of IOs and tests it using the first
   quantitative data set on the topic. I argue that the primary obstacle to
   effective institutional performance is not deviant behavior by IO
   officials-as conventional "rogue-agency" analyses suggest-but the
   propensity of states to use IOs to promote narrow national interests
   rather than broader organizational objectives. IOs that enjoy policy
   autonomy vis-a-vis states will thus exhibit higher levels of
   performance. However, in the international context policy autonomy
   cannot be guaranteed by institutional design. Instead, it is a function
   of (1) the existence of (certain types of) institutionalized alliances
   between IOs and actors above and below the state; and (2) the technical
   complexity of IO activities. I provide empirical evidence for the
   argument by constructing and analyzing a cross-sectional data set on IO
   performance-based in part on a new wave of official government
   evaluations of IOs and in part on an original survey of IO staff-and
   conducting a comparative case study in the realm of global food
   security.

AB Why have peace-building and reconstruction efforts so frequently failed

   violence in volatile sites of cyclical conflict? Extant theory predicts
   that new institutions can help overcome violence and mitigate commitment
   problems in postconflict contexts by reducing uncertainty in inherently
   uncertain environments. By contrast, this article argues that
   postconflict institutions often prove limited in their abilities to
   contribute to durable peace because they offer wartime elites new venues
   in which to pursue conflict-era agendas. Through a micro-analysis of
   efforts to build the rule of law in eastern Democratic Republic of
   Congo, I demonstrate that wartime elites capture and instrumentalize new
   legal institutions to maximize their intra-and inter-organizational
   survival; to pursue economic, military, and political agendas behind the

AB Do normative arguments change what political actors do and if so, how?
   Rather than using the pure force of abstract moral reasoning, states
   often try to move the locus of contestation to an arena where they can
   make practical progress-the evidence or the empirical facts in support
   of their argument. This paper analyzes how states try to bolster their
   position first by constructing an argument in which an action represents
   part of their argument and then by performing that action to make the
   argument seem more convincing. I call this mechanism rhetorical
   adduction. The paper challenges theories of communication that deny a
   causal role to the content of normative arguments and diverges from a
   leading view on argumentation that arguments have their effects through
   persuasion. Integrating strategic argumentation theory with theory from
   psychology about how people make choices based on compelling reasons
   rather than cost-benefit analysis, I also use theory from sociology on
   how people resolve morally complex situations through the performance of
   "reality tests." I illustrate the mechanism using a case from the
   Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 when initial resistance to recognizing the
   putative state of Bangladesh after India's invasion of East Pakistan was
   reversed as a result of an argument that Indian troop withdrawal meant
   that international norms were not violated.

AB The international tax system is a complex regime composed of thousands
   of bilateral tax treaties. These agreements coordinate policies between
   countries to avoid double taxation and encourage international
   investment. I argue that by solving this coordination problem on a
   bilateral basis, states have inadvertently created opportunities for
   treaty shopping by multinationals. These opportunities, in turn, reduce
   the potency of fiscal policy, put pressure on governments to change
   their domestic tax laws, and ultimately constrain state autonomy. This
   constraint is theoretically distinct from the usual race-to-the-bottom
   story and it generates different testable implications. I use a
   motivating case study to show how multinationals leverage the structure
   of the treaty network to reduce their tax burden. Then, I develop a new
   measure of treaty-shopping opportunities for firms in 164 countries.
   Where the proliferation of tax treaties allows multinationals to engage
   in treaty shopping, states' fiscal autonomy is limited, and governments
   tend to maintain lower tax rates.

AB While increasing trade and foreign direct investment, international

   most productive multinationals by lowering preferential tariffs. We
   examine data covering the near universe of US foreign direct investment
   and disaggregated tariff data from PTAs signed by the United States. Our
   results indicate that US preferential tariffs increase sales to the
   United States from the most competitive subsidiaries of multinational
   corporations operating in partner countries. We also find increases in
   market concentration in partner countries following preferential
   liberalization with the United States. By demonstrating that the gains
   from preferential liberalization are unevenly distributed across firms,
   we shed new light on the firm-level, economic sources of political
   mobilization over international trade and investment policies.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), more popularly known as "drones," have
   become emblematic of twenty-first century military technologies but
   scholars have yet to convincingly explain the drivers of UAV
   proliferation. Using the first systematic data set of UAV proliferation,
   this research note examines the spread of UAVs in the context of
   scholarly debates about interests versus capacity in explaining policy
   adoption. The results yield important insights for both IR scholarship
   and the policy-making community. While countries that experience
   security threats-including territorial disputes and terrorism-are more
   likely to seek UAVs, drone proliferation is not simply a function of the
   threat environment. We find evidence that democracies and autocracies
   are more likely than mixed regimes to develop armed UAV programs, and
   suggest that autocracies and democracies have their own unique
   incentives to acquire this technology. Moreover, supply-side factors
   play a role in the UAV proliferation process: a state's technological
   capacity is a strong predictor of whether it will obtain the most
   sophisticated UAVs. The theories and evidence we present challenge
   emerging views about UAV proliferation and shed useful light on how and
   why drones spread.

AB The concept of embedded autonomy speaks to the importance of
   coordination and bidirectional information exchange between Weberian
   bureaucrats and their private sector interlocutors. It has proven
   influential in the sociology of development, where it originated, and in
   the broader discipline. But the prospects for bidirectional information
   exchange depend upon the structure and nature of the private sector,
   which has been all but overlooked by the literature on embedded
   autonomy. This article therefore encourages scholars to take private
   sector structure seriously by bringing existing network analytic methods
   to bear on the embedded autonomy debate. Specifically, I identify a
   tension between the requisites of information gathering, which is
   facilitated by nonredundant ties among actors, and information
   diffusion, which requires redundant ties; demonstrate how one Mexican
   agency has resolved this tension in assisting the upgrading of the
   artisanal ceramics sector; and conclude that the strategic filling of
   social network holes lies at the heart of effective bureacrats' efforts
   to promote development.

AB Many accounts of political belief systems conceive of them as networks
   of interrelated opinions, in which some beliefs are central and others
   peripheral. This article formally shows how such structural features can
   be used to construct direct measures of belief centrality in a network
   of correlations. This method is applied to the 2000 ANES data, which
   have been used to argue that political beliefs are organized around
   parenting schemas. This structural approach instead yields results
   consistent with the central role of political identity, which
   individuals may use as the organizing heuristic to filter information
   from the political field. In light of recent accounts of belief system
   heterogeneity, a search for population heterogeneity in this organizing
   logic was undertaken first by comparing 44 demographic subpopulations
   and then using inductive techniques. Contra these recent accounts, the
   study finds that belief systems of different groups vary in the amount
   of organization but not in the logic that organizes them.

   they investigate the multidimensional nature of gender-role attitudes in
   17 postindustrial European countries. They identify three distinct
   varieties of egalitarianism that they designate as liberal
   egalitarianism, egalitarian familism, and flexible egalitarianism. They
   show that while traditional gender-role attitudes have precipitously and
   uniformly declined in accordance with the rising tide narrative toward
   greater egalitarianism, the relative prevalence of different
   egalitarianisms varies markedly across countries. Furthermore, they find
   that European nations are not converging toward one dominant egalitarian
   model but rather, remain differentiated by varieties of egalitarianism.

   framework focuses on how community attributes, particularly the relative

   moral reform activism by affecting both the convictions and motivations
   of potential supporters. The theory is applied in an analysis of
   county-level variation in the presence of antiabortion pregnancy centers
   (PCs). The authors find that the proportion of individuals affiliated
   with Roman Catholicism or evangelical denominations has a curvilinear
   relationship with PC establishment, reflecting the way in which group
   size can affirm convictions that are the lifeblood of moral reform but
   can also reduce motivation to act when the size of the group surpasses
   majority status. The authors also find that PCs are more likely to be
   found in communities where gender roles are relatively egalitarian.

AB This article uses sequence analysis to examine how gender inequality in
   work-family trajectories unfolds from early adulthood until middle age
   in two different welfare state contexts. Results based on the National
   Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the German National Education Panel
   Study demonstrate that in Germany, all work-family trajectories are
   highly gender-specific irrespective of social class. In contrast,
   patterns of work-family interplay across the life course in the United
   States are, overall, less gendered, but they differ widely by social
   class. In fact, work-family patterns characterized by high occupational
   prestige are fairly equally accessible for men and women. However, women
   are far more likely than men to experience the joint occurrence of
   single parenthood and unstable low-prestige work careers in the United
   States. The authors contribute to the literature by bringing in a
   longitudinal, process-oriented life course perspective and
   conceptualizing work-family trajectories as interlocked,
   multidimensional processes.

AB Credence goods markets suffer from inefficiencies caused by superior
   information of sellers about the surplus-maximising quality. While
   standard theory predicts that equal mark-up prices solve the credence
   goods problem if customers can verify the quality received, experimental
   evidence indicates the opposite. We identify a lack of robustness with
   respect to heterogeneity in social preferences as a possible cause of
   this and conduct new experiments that allow for parsimonious
   identification of sellers' social preference types. Our results confirm
   the assumed heterogeneity in social preferences and provide strong
   support for our explanation of the failure of verifiability to increase
   efficiency.

AB Several recent macroeconomic models assume that real wages are rigid.
   The wage rigidity of newly hired workers assumes a crucial role in these
   models, as the decision of whether to open a vacancy is primarily
   influenced by real hiring wages. This article analyses the cyclical
   behaviour of real wages in Germany. It considers recent concerns that
   not controlling for cyclical job up and downgrading leads to biased
   results. The results indicate that wages are not rigid - neither for all
   workers nor for newly hired workers - but instead respond considerably
   to business cycle conditions.

AB We estimate a model of illicit drugs markets using data on purchases of
   crack cocaine. Buyers are searching for high-quality drugs, but they
   determine drugs' quality (i.e., their purity) only after consuming them.
   Hence, sellers can rip off first-time buyers or can offer-higher-quality
   drugs to induce buyers to purchase from them again. In equilibrium, a
   distribution of qualities persists. The estimated model implies that if
   drugs were legalized, in which case purity could be regulated and hence
   observable, the average purity of drugs would increase by approximately
   20 percent and the dispersion would decrease by approximately 80
   percent. Moreover, increasing penalties may raise the purity and
   affordability of the drugs traded by increasing sellers' relative
   profitability of targeting loyal buyers versus first-time buyers.

AB Economic sociologists have studied how social relationships shape market
   prices by focusing mostly on vertical interactions between buyers and
   sellers. In this article, we examine instead the price consequences of
   horizontal relationships that arise from intergroup processes among
   sellers. Our setting is the market for Champagne grapes. Using
   proprietary transaction-level data, we find that female grape growersa
   minority in the growers' communitycharge systematically higher prices
   than do male grape growers. We argue that the underlying mechanism for
   this unexpected pattern of results involves the relationships developed
   and maintained by minority members. Specifically, in-depth fieldwork
   reveals that female growers get together to compensate for their
   isolation from the majority. This behavior enables them to overcome
   local constraints on the availability of price-relevant information,
   constraints that stem from prevailing norms of market behavior:
   individualism and secrecy. We discuss the implications of these findings
   for the study of how relationships shape price-setting processes, for
   the sociological literature on intergroup relations, and for our
   understanding of inequality in markets.

   (FFS) Physician Utilization and Payment Data in 2012 and 2013 released
   by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we construct
   estimates for physicians' hours spent on Medicare beneficiaries. We find
   that about 2,300 physicians, representing about 3 percent of those with
   20 or more hours of Medicare Part B FFS services, have billed Medicare
   over 100 hours per week. We consider these implausibly long hours.

AB Using local administrative data from 1826 to 1936, we document the
   evolution of crime rates in nineteenth century France and we estimate
   the impact of a negative income shock on crime. Our identification
   strategy exploits the phylloxera crisis. Between 1863 and 1890,
   phylloxera destroyed about 40% of French vineyards. We use the
   geographical variation in the timing of this shock to identify its
   impact on property and violent crime rates, as well as minor offences.
   Our estimates suggest that the phylloxera crisis caused a substantial
   increase in property crime rates and a significant decrease in violent
   crimes.

   income have lower health risks and are better insured. We show that
   income differences between risk types lead to a violation of single
   crossing in an insurance model where people choose treatment intensity.
   We analyse different market structures and show the following: if
   insurers have market power, the violation of single crossing caused by
   income differences and endogenous treatment choice can explain the
   empirically observed outcome. Our results do not rely on differences in
   risk aversion between types.

   Sociological Review between 2000-2004 and 2010-2014 that use regression
   models (N = 356). Our main aim is to determine whether the authors
   discuss the effect size of their findings and distinguish substantive
   from statistical significance. We apply a five-item questionnaire to
   each article and find that about half of the articles erroneously
   interpret a statistically insignificant coefficient as a zero effect,
   while only one in three engage in a discussion of the substantive
   meaning of the effect sizes. Moreover, our findings show a negative
   trend in the practice of significance testing over the past 15 years.
   These results are similar to those of the comparable review in the field
   of economics. We conclude by providing a set of recommendations on how
   to reduce the misuse of significance testing in sociological research,
   through an informed benchmarking of the findings.

AB Previous research has documented that unemployed job applicants have
   problems re-entering the labour market, commonly referred to as scarring
   effects of unemployment. Studies have also documented ethnic
   discrimination in the labour market. Yet, we do not know how these
   categories jointly shape employers hiring decisions. Thus, we do not
   know if unemployed minorities face an additive or a multiplicative
   disadvantage in hiring processes. Building on experimental data from two
   waves of a randomized field experiment, we test whether we find an
   ethnic scarring effect, which would imply that contemporary long-term
   unemployment is particularly harmful to native-born ethnic minorities.
   As expected, our experiment documents scarring effects of contemporary
   long-term unemployment. We also found, as expected, systematically lower
   call-backs for applicants with Pakistani/Muslim names. Also, our results
   show that unemployed minorities face an additive disadvantage in the
   labour market. Thus, we find no evidence of an ethnic scarring effect of
   unemployment, which would imply different consequences of unemployment
   for minority and majority applicants.

AB The field of neighbourhood effects studies on individual socio-economic
   outcomes has two main shortcomings. Most studies (i) ignore the impact
   of the neighbourhood on the duration of inactivity and timing of
   entering the labour market and, (ii) disregard the heterogeneity of
   these neighbourhood effects for different household configurations over
   the life course. Yet, it is likely that the neighbourhood influences its
   residents in heterogeneous ways. This study analyses the differential
   impact of the neighbourhood on the individual transition rates from
   inactivity to work from a life course perspective. It applies a discrete
   time event history analysis with unique individual-level population
   panel data from 2004 to 2011 in the Netherlands, covering a random
   sample of over 30,000 individuals with changes in employment status,
   household position, and neighbourhoods over time. The models suggest
   that residing in a deprived neighbourhood only hampers the transition to
   work for women, above and beyond their individual characteristics and
   household resources, as well as that this association hinges on their
   household composition: our findings show that only for partnered mothers
   with the youngest child below 4 years and single mothers with the
   youngest child between 4 and 12 years a higher level of neighbourhood
   deprivation results in a statistically significant reduction in the odds
   of making the transition to work. These conditional neighbourhood
   effects reveal unexplored mechanisms and generate different kinds of
   policy implications from the ones we usually see.

AB Mafias move across territories. Recent research identifies push and pull

   testing of the structural determinants of mafia activity in
   non-traditional territories is still lacking. By using new data on >
   1,500 municipalities of a Northern Italian region, coupled with recently
   developed statistical techniques, this study looks at how social,
   economic, and political factors contribute to explaining the presence of
   mafias in a given area of a non- traditional region. The study finds
   that the presence of business sectors with low entry barriers
   significantly increases the probability of mafia activity, and that low
   levels of civic culture constitute facilitating conditions as well.
   Moreover, findings show that geography is important, and suggest that
   spatial spillover mechanisms are at work.

AB When are donations to non-profit organizations responsive to changes in
   government funding? This article examines relations between government
   financial support and charitable donations in an innovative
   mixed-methods design. A unique data set is obtained, matching
   individual-level survey data from the Giving in the Netherlands Panel
   Survey with media coverage of government support from LexisNexis and
   organizational-level information from the Dutch Central Bureau on
   Fundraising from 2002 to 2014. An interpretative analysis shows the ways
   in which people are informed about changes in public funding, which is
   assumed to be a prerequisite for donors to change their donations. Media
   coverage often does not reflect actual changes in government support.
   Additionally, regression analyses are deployed to examine how changes in
   government support and media reports are associated with changes in
   donations. The results show that responses to public funding are
   dependent on the non-profit context. Donations in the fields of social
   services, health, and nature are displaced by government support, while
   crowding-out does not occur in the field of international development.
   Even in fields where crowding-out is more likely to occur, the increase
   in donations does not offset the decrease in public support. The
   conclusions nuance popular beliefs about the direct consequences that
   policy changes have for public awareness and participation.

AB In contemporary Western Europe, both scholars and the public discuss the
   consequences of a rising share of a comparatively religious Muslim
   population for societal coexistence. Yet we know surprisingly little
   about how religion and religiosity shape social relationships. Focusing
   on adolescents' friendship networks, we examine how religion and
   religiosity affect intra-and inter-group friendship choices. While youth
   should generally prefer to befriend peers of the same religion, this
   religious homophily should be more pronounced for highly than for less
   religious youth. Against the background of rising anti-Muslim attitudes
   in Europe, Christian and non-religious youth further may be particularly
   hesitant to befriend Muslim peers, and especially highly religious ones.
   We analysed three waves of German longitudinal friendship network data
   from ethnically diverse schools. Regarding intra-group friendships,
   while Muslim youth indeed preferred to befriend Muslim peers, Christian
   youth displayed no evidence of religious homophily. For Muslims, higher
   levels of religiosity further increased this preference. Regarding
   inter-group friendships, irrespective of their individual religiosity,
   Muslim youth were socially divided from their non-Muslim peers, as both
   Christian and nonreligious youth were reluctant to befriend Muslim
   peers. In sum, in the German context, religion itself rather than
   religiosity seems to matter most for adolescents' friendship choices.

AB Our article assesses the role of information barriers for patterns of

   Higher Education (HE). Using longitudinal data, we investigate student
   expectations about the profitability of HE, their evolution over time
   and their correlation with study plans among Italian high school
   seniors. We find that student believes are highly inaccurate,
   systematically biased and poorly updated. Then, we present estimates of
   the causal effect of information barriers on educational plans based on
   a large-scale clustered randomized experiment. We designed a counseling
   intervention to correct student misperceptions of the profitability of
   HE and assessed whether treated students' plans changed differentially
   relative to a control group. The intervention was quite effective in
   correcting student misperceptions, but this did not translate into
   increased intentions to enroll in university education. However, the
   treatment affected preferences between fields of study, between short
   and long university paths, and between university and vocationally
   oriented programs. Hence, information barriers affect substantially the
   internal differentiation of HE and the related horizontal inequalities
   by gender and family background.

AB We examine changes in higher education (HE) participation in the four
   major Nordic countries-Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Sweden-from 1985 to
   2010, a period characterized by widespread expansion of HE. We set up a
   methodological framework suitable for making country comparisons, and we
   profit from having unique administrative data in all four countries. We
   ask (i) whether HE expansion in the Nordic countries has been followed
   by a similar closing of the social gap in HE participation, and (ii)
   whether privileged groups have been able to maintain their advantage in
   HE participation. The results did not reveal similar trends in decrease
   in HE inequality despite expansion in all four countries. While Finland
   and Norway display the most substantial drop in overall HE inequality,
   the decrease in Denmark is more modest; Sweden shows no signs of
   decreasing inequality as HE expands. In short, expansion does not seem
   to be a universal remedy for narrowing the social gap in HE
   participation in the Nordic countries. Examining upper tertiary
   education by field of study, we find great disparities in selectivity,
   but we also find that the vast majority of fields have moved towards
   more equalization. However, prestigious professional university
   programmes such as law and medicine continue to favour more socially
   privileged children, albeit the social gap is narrowed substantially in
   Finland and Norway. These two countries also display the most
   substantial decrease in overall HE inequality.

   literature, we formulate two opposing hypotheses suggesting a positive
   and a negative relationship between income inequality and
   status-seeking. To test these hypotheses, we use repeated
   cross-sectional micro-data from the European Social Survey, which was
   collected biannually from 2002 to 2014, and use it in combination with
   income inequality data from Eurostat. With this data we complement
   existing studies by focusing on both between-and within-country
   over-time variability in income inequality and status-seeking. We find
   evidence of a negative relationship between income inequality and
   status-seeking. This supports the hypothesis that with higher levels of
   economic inequality people have less incentives and less motivation to
   strive for heightened social status.

AB A long-standing hypothesis in the sociology of education is that the
   timing of ability tracking impacts the inequality of educational
   opportunity. While earlier studies mainly focused on how early tracking
   impacts the primary effect of social origin (systematic performance
   differences due to social background), the impact of early tracking on
   the secondary effect of social origin (class-specific educational
   decision-making) has been neglected. Recently, the idea has been put
   forward that late tracking decreases uncertainty in educational
   decision-making, thus enabling more rational decision-making by
   lower-class individuals. Extending this idea, we propose the uncertainty
   reduction mechanism (URM) as a theoretical foundation; this mechanism
   can be derived from a decision-theoretic model on educational
   decision-making based on prospect theory. Moreover, we perform a first
   empirical test of the URM by means of a computerized laboratory
   experiment. The evidence is in line with the model predictions and the
   results support the intuition that a postponement of tracking could
   reduce the negative bias of lower-class individuals in educational
   decision-making, thereby reducing educational inequality with respect to
   social background.

AB The European Social Survey (ESS) is a biennial, academically driven,
   cross-sectional, pan-European social survey that charts and explains the
   interactions between Europe's changing institutions and the attitudes,
   beliefs, and behaviour patterns of its diverse populations. As part of
   the seventh round of the ESS, we successfully developed a rotating
   module that provides a comprehensive and comparative pan-European data
   set on the social determinants of health and health inequalities. In
   this article, we present the rationale for the module, the health
   outcomes, and social determinants that were included, and some of the
   opportunities that the module provide for advancing research into
   explaining the distribution and aetiology of social inequalities in
   health in Europe. Thus far, no health survey has had sufficient data on
   the stratification system of societies, including rich data on living
   conditions, and there is no sociological survey with sufficient variety
   of lifestyle factors and health outcomes. By including unhealthy
   lifestyle behaviours, childhood conditions, housing conditions, working
   conditions, and variables describing access to healthcare, together with
   an extensive set of mental and physical health outcomes, the ESS has
   strengthened its position tremendously as a data source for sociologists
   wanting to perform European cross-national analyses of health
   inequalities.

AB Building on Karl Mannheim's theory of generations, this address argues
   that U.S. Millennials comprise a new political generation with lived
   experiences and worldviews that set them apart from their elders. Not
   only are they the first generation of digital natives, but, although
   they are more educated than any previous U.S. generation, they face a
   labor market in which precarity is increasingly the norm. And despite
   proclamations to the contrary, they confront persistent racial and
   gender disparities, discrimination against sexual minorities, and
   widening class inequalityall of which they understand in the framework
   of intersectionality. This address analyzes the four largest social
   movements spearheaded by college-educated Millennials: the young
   undocumented immigrant Dreamers, the 2011 Occupy Wall Street uprising,
   the campus movement protesting sexual assault, and the Black Lives
   Matter movement. All four reflect the distinctive historical experience
   of the Millennial generation, but they vary along two cross-cutting
   dimensions: (1) the social characteristics of activists and leaders, and
   (2) the dominant modes of organization and strategic repertoires.

AB The differentiation of occupations is of central concern to
   stratification scholars studying class and mobility, yet little is known
   about how individuals actually see the occupational landscape.
   Sociologists have long collected data on individual perceptions of where
   occupations stand relative to one another, but these data are rarely
   used to study the logics that individuals employ when categorizing
   occupations. Using the 1989 GSS occupational prestige module, we
   investigate how cognitive maps of the occupational hierarchy vary in
   terms of content and structure. The results show that maps are more
   homogeneous among individuals with more versus less education. This
   increased consensus arises, in part, because better educated respondents
   are more likely to set aside training-intensive occupations as a
   relatively elite set of occupations at the top of the hierarchy. In
   contrast, less educated respondents generate more gradational
   classification systems that are significantly less sensitive to training
   intensiveness as a basis for categorical distinction. This study
   contributes to our empirical knowledge of valuation and raises new
   questions about how individuals organize and navigate social structures.

AB The molecularization of race thesis suggests geneticists are gaining
   greater authority to define human populations and differences, and they
   are doing so by increasingly defining them in terms of U.S. racial
   categories. Using a mixed methodology of a content analysis of articles
   published in Nature Genetics (in 1993, 2001, and 2009) and interviews,
   we explore geneticists' population labeling practices. Geneticists use
   eight classification systems that follow racial, geographic, and ethnic
   logics of definition. We find limited support for racialization of
   classification. Use of quasi-racial continental terms has grown over
   time, but more surprising is the persistent and indiscriminate blending
   of classification schemes at the field level, the article level, and
   within-population labels. This blending has led the practical definition
   of population to become more ambiguous rather than standardized over
   time. Classificatory ambiguity serves several functions: it helps
   geneticists negotiate collaborations among researchers with competing
   demands, resist bureaucratic oversight, and build accountability with
   study populations. Far from being dysfunctional, we show the ambiguity
   of population definition is linked to geneticists' efforts to build
   scientific authority. Our findings revise the long-standing theoretical
   link between scientific authority and standardization and social order.
   We find that scientific ambiguity can function to produce scientific
   authority.

AB While influential across a wide variety of subfields, cultural analysis
   in sociology continues to be hampered by coarse-grained
   conceptualizations of the different modes in which culture becomes
   personal, as well as the process via which persons acquire and use
   different forms of culture. In this article, I argue that persons
   acquire and use culture in two analytically and empirically distinct
   forms, which I label declarative and nondeclarative. The mode of
   cultural acquisition depends on the dynamics of exposure and encoding,
   and modulates the process of cultural accessibility, activation, and
   use. Cultural knowledge about one domain may be redundantly represented
   in both declarative and nondeclarative forms, each linked via
   analytically separable pathways to corresponding public cultural forms
   and ultimately to substantive outcomes. I outline how the new
   theoretical vocabulary, theoretical model, and analytic distinctions
   that I propose can be used to resolve contradictions and improve our
   understanding of outstanding substantive issues in empirically oriented
   subfields that have recently incorporated cultural processes as a core
   explanatory resource.

AB Research on the gender division of family labor largely focuses on
   housework and childcare in spousal couples. This article advances
   scholarship by examining the gender division of elderly parent care in
   sibling groups. Using the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally
   representative survey of elderly Americans, I find that caregiving to
   elderly parents varies not only by an adult child's own gender, but also
   by the gender of the siblings with whom caregiving is shared and by the
   gender of the parent to whom care is provided. The salience of an adult
   child's gender manifests in two primary ways: not only do daughters
   provide more care than do sons to their elderly parents, but daughters'
   caregiving is also more elastic with respect to their own and their
   parents' attributes than is sons' caregiving. With respect to the gender
   of the siblings, sons provide relatively less care if they have sisters,
   whereas daughters provide relatively more care if they have brothers.
   With respect to the gender of the parent, sons provide relatively more
   care to fathers, and daughters provide relatively more care to mothers.
   Finally, analyses did not reveal changes over time.

AB Gender pay gaps likely persist in Western societies because both men and
   women consider somewhat lower earnings for female employees than for
   otherwise similar male employees to be fair. Two different theoretical
   approaches explain legitimate wage gaps: same-gender referent theory and
   reward expectations theory. The first approach states that women compare
   their lower earnings primarily with that of other underpaid women; the
   second approach argues that both men and women value gender as a status
   variable that yields lower expectations about how much each gender
   should be paid for otherwise equal work. This article is the first to
   analyze hypotheses contrasting the two theories using an experimental
   factorial survey design. In 2009, approximately 1,600 German residents
   rated more than 26,000 descriptions of fictitious employees. The labor
   market characteristics of each employee and the amount of information
   given about them were experimentally varied across all descriptions. The
   results primarily support reward expectations theory. Both men and women
   produced gender pay gaps in their fairness ratings (with the mean ratio
   of just female-to-male wages being .92). Respondents framed the just pay
   ratios by the gender inequalities they experienced in their own
   occupations, and some evidence of gender-specific evaluation standards
   emerged.

AB Numerous studies have revealed a seemingly paradoxical pattern in which,
   despite cultural differences, unfamiliarity with the educational system,
   and possible language difficulties, children of immigrants outperform
   their peers with native-born parents in the U.S. educational system. We
   problematize the notion of an immigrant paradox in education by
   broadening our conceptualization of social class background, and
   introducing the concept of contextual attainment to capture the
   geographic and historical contexts in which education is completed.
   Analyzing nationally representative longitudinal survey data combined
   with international educational data, we show that, for immigrant
   parents, contextual attainments vary between and within countries of
   origin and often diverge from post-migration socioeconomic statuses.
   Parental contextual attainment helps explain why, net of standard family
   socioeconomic status measures, most groups of immigrants' children
   complete more years of schooling than do White Americans with
   native-born parents. Moreover, considering parental contextual
   attainment leads to a rethinking of intergenerational educational
   mobility patterns for adults with immigrant parents. We argue that
   contextual attainment captures the noneconomic benefits of higher class
   background that help explain how intergenerational educational
   inequalities are reproduced.

AB This article integrates insights from the sociology of the body and the
   sociology of immigration to examine the role of the body in the
   immigrant incorporation process. Drawing on three years of participant
   observation in a West African immigrant community, I show how immigrants
   from a predominantly agrarian society must adapt and retrain their
   bodies, often under great pressure, to meet the demands of American
   social institutions. Immigrants' ability to move their bodies in
   socially prescribed ways affects three crucial aspects of the
   incorporation process: identity formation, economic mobility, and
   transnational practices. Immigrants who struggle to execute the host
   society's normative bodily movements (1) interpret their bodily
   challenges as evidence of their outsider identity, (2) struggle to
   acquire the material resources necessary to achieve more traditionally
   studied forms of economic incorporation, and (3) face limitations in
   their ability to maintain transnational networks even as those networks
   play an increasingly important social role in the face of their blocked
   mobility. These findings indicate that bodily incorporation is a
   critical precursor to full incorporation into the host society.

AB Over the past two decades, two dominant themes have emerged in the study
   of desistance from crime: desistance is a gradual process, and embedded
   in the desistance process are important life events or turning points.
   Yet sociological and criminological empirical studies of desistance tend
   to focus on these two processes separately. Using a panel of serious
   offenders, we examine the progression over age of the probability of
   participation in legal employment and offending, and consider how past
   participation in one regime is associated with the decision to remain in
   or switch regimes. We model desistance from crime as a discrete-time
   Markovian process, which allows us to trace the process of desistance
   prospectively and to embed within it participation in legal work or not.
   We find that the conditional probabilities of being in certain states
   (e.g., legal employment, crime) are heavily dependent on one's prior
   state. Furthermore, we find that this process has inertia-or memory-in
   that the probability of legal employment increases and the probability
   of crime decreases, based on accumulated legal employment.

AB We draw on panel data from a randomized field experiment to assess the
   effects of a flexibility/supervisor support initiative called STAR on
   turnover intentions and voluntary turnover among professional technical
   workers in a large firm. An unanticipated exogenous shock-the
   announcement of an impending merger-occurred in the middle of data
   collection. Both organizational changes reflect an emerging employment
   contract characterized by increasing employee temporal flexibility even
   as employers wield greater flexibility in reorganizing their workforces.
   We theorized STAR would reduce turnover intentions and actual turnover
   by making it more attractive to stay with the current employer. We found
   being in a STAR team (versus a usual practice team) lowered turnover
   intentions 12 months later and reduced the risk of voluntary turnover
   over almost three years. We also examined potential mechanisms
   accounting for the effects of these two organizational changes; STAR
   effects on reducing turnover intentions are partially mediated by
   reducing work-to-family conflict, family-to-work conflict, burnout,
   psychological distress, perceived stress, and increasing job
   satisfaction. The effect of learning about the merger on increasing
   turnover intentions is fully mediated by increased job insecurity. STAR
   also moderates the negative effects of learning about the merger on
   turnover intentions for different subgroups. Findings provide insights
   into the effectiveness of an organizational intervention, the dynamics
   of organizations, and how competing logics of two organizational changes
   affect employees' labor market expectations and behavior.

AB Since the Kyoto Protocol, and prior to the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown in

   its promise to meet energy demands while mitigating the risks of global
   warming. The Fukushima nuclear disaster and humanitarian crisis caused
   by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011 called the entire nuclear
   industry into question. However, the silence among established
   environmental organizations continued. Based on an extensive study of
   Japanese environmental organizations, we investigate why Japanese
   environmental organizations were relatively silent on one of the largest
   environmental crises in the country's history. We address this question
   historically and quantitatively, incorporating survey data on a national
   sample of Japanese environmental organizations. This research also
   quantitatively operationalizes the effects of board of director
   composition on the behavior of a subsample of environmental
   organizations (EOs). The statistical analyses show that environmental
   groups with government and corporate board members are significantly
   less likely to publicly denounce nuclear energy following the Fukushima
   meltdown. The political- organizational embeddedness of these EOs are
   illustrated with a network heuristic of overlapping industry,
   government, and environmental organizations.

   whether exposure to multiple forms of discrimination (e.g., race and

   youth. We study a program called Becoming a Man (BAM), developed by the
   nonprofit Youth Guidance, in two RCTs implemented in 2009-2010 and
   2013-2015. In the two studies participation in the program reduced total
   arrests during the intervention period by 28-35%, reduced violent-crime
   arrests by 45-50%, improved school engagement, and in the first study
   where we have follow-up data, increased graduation rates by 12-19%. The
   third RCT tested a program with partially overlapping components carried
   out in the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC), which
   reduced readmission rates to the facility by 21%. These large behavioral
   responses combined with modest program costs imply benefit-cost ratios
   for these interventions from 5-to-1 up to 30-to-1 or more. Our data on
   mechanisms are not ideal, but we find no positive evidence that these
   effects are due to changes in emotional intelligence or social skills,
   self-control or "grit," or a generic mentoring effect. We find
   suggestive support for the hypothesis that the programs work by helping
   youth slow down and reflect on whether their automatic thoughts and
   behaviors are well suited to the situation they are in, or whether the
   situation could be construed differently.

   away export platforms-that is, they do not allow foreign affiliates of
   multinationals to export-or by ignoring fixed costs associated with
   foreign investment. I develop a quantifiable multicountry general
   equilibrium model, which tractably handles multinational firms that
   engage in export platform sales and that face fixed costs of foreign
   investment. I first estimate the model using German firm-level data to
   uncover the size and nature of costs of multinational enterprise and
   show that the fixed costs of foreign investment are large. Second, I
   calibrate the model to data on trade and multinational production for
   twelve European and North American countries. Counterfactual analysis
   reveals that multinationals play an important role in transmitting
   technological improvements to foreign countries and that the pending
   Canada-EU trade and investment agreement could divert a sizable fraction
   of the production of EU multinationals from the U.S. to Canada.

AB By exploiting a commuting policy that led to a sharp and unexpected
   inflow of Czech workers to areas along the German-Czech border, we
   examine the impact of an exogenous immigration-induced labor supply
   shock on local wages and employment of natives. On average, the supply
   shock leads to a moderate decline in local native wages and a sharp
   decline in local native employment. These average effects mask
   considerable heterogeneity across groups: while younger natives
   experience larger wage effects, employment responses are particularly
   pronounced for older natives. This pattern is inconsistent with
   standardmodels of immigration but can be accounted for by a model that
   allows for a larger labor supply elasticity or a higher degree of wage
   rigidity for older than for young workers. We further show that the
   employment response is almost entirely driven by diminished inflows of
   natives into work rather than outflows into other areas or
   nonemployment, suggesting that "outsiders" shield "insiders" from the
   increased competition.

AB Technological advances and the development of social media have made
   petitions, public protests, and other form of spontaneous activism
   increasingly common tools for individuals to influence decision makers.
   To study these phenomena, in this article I present a theory of
   petitions and public protests that explores their limits as mechanisms
   to aggregate information. The key assumption is that valuable
   information is dispersed among citizens. Through petitions and protests,
   citizens can signal their private information to the policy maker, who
   can then choose to use it or not. I first show that if citizens'
   individual signals are not sufficiently precise, information aggregation
   is impossible, no matter how large is the population of informed
   citizens, even if the conflict with the policy maker is small. I then
   characterize the conditions on conflict and the signal structure that
   guarantee information aggregation. When these conditions are satisfied,
   I show that full information aggregation is possible as the population
   grows to infinity. When they are not satisfied, I show that information
   aggregation may still be possible if social media are available.

   our model, the effects of taxation on growth are highly nonlinear. Low

   rates rise, their negative impact on growth rises dramatically. The

   prices follow Medicare's lead. A $1.00 increase in Medicare's fees
   increases corresponding private prices by $1.16. A second set of
   Medicare fee changes, which generates area-specific payment shocks, has
   a similar effect on private reimbursements. Medicare's influence is
   strongest in areas with concentrated insurers and competitive physician
   markets, consistent with insurer-doctor bargaining. By echoing
   Medicare's pricing changes, these payment spillovers amplify Medicare's
   impact on specialty choice and other welfare-relevant aspects of

   We identify the impact of access to broadband Internet on affective
   polarization by exploiting differences in broadband availability brought
   about by variation in state right-of-way regulations (ROW). We merge
   state-level regulation data with county-level broadband penetration data
   and a large-N sample of survey data from 2004 to 2008 and find that
   access to broadband Internet increases partisan hostility. The effect
   occurs in both years and is stable across levels of political interest.
   We also find that access to broadband Internet boosts partisans'

AB We formalize and examine two overlapping models that show how rising
   inequality combined with ethnic and racial heterogeneity can explain why
   many advanced industrial countries have experienced a drop in support
   for redistribution as inequality has risen. One model, based on altruism
   and homophily, focuses on the effect of increasing social distance
   between the poor and the middle class, especially when minorities are
   increasingly overrepresented among the very poor. The other, based on
   self-interest, combines an insurance model of preferences for
   redistribution with increasingly segmented labor markets, in which
   immigration of workers without recognized skills leaves most native
   workers better off but intensifies competition for low-end jobs.
   Empirically, when we estimate parameters from the two models using data
   from multiple waves of ISSP surveys, we find that labor market
   segmentation, previously omitted in this literature, has more consistent
   effects than social distance.

   learn more. We find that: (1) policymakers who are ideologically
   predisposed against the described policy are relatively unwilling to
   learn from others, but (2) such ideological biases can be overcome with
   an emphasis on the policy's success or on its adoption by co-partisans
   in other communities. We also find a similar partisan-based bias among
   traditional ideological supporters, who are less willing to learn from
   those in the opposing party. The experimental approach offered here

AB How does multinational corporation (MNC) activity affect corruption in

   economic integration helps reduce corruption, as it increases market
   competition and efficiency and promotes the diffusion of good
   governance. In this article, I argue that such a generalization
   oversimplifies the consequences of MNC activity in host countries. The
   entry and presence of MNCs may contribute to rent creation in developing
   countries, thereby leading to a high level of corruption. To test this
   argument, I conduct a case study on China and draw from original data of
   filed corruption cases to construct measures of corruption. I find that
   provinces with more MNC activity are strongly associated with more
   corruption. The results are robust and consistent when possible
   endogeneity, law enforcement, and alternative measures of corruption are
   considered. This finding has important implications for domestic
   governance in developing countries.

   observe substantial differences in email tone. Hispanic housing
   applicants were 20 percentage points less likely to be greeted by name

   immigration effects persist even in the face of statistical controls for
   attitudes toward African Americans and attitudes toward the poor;
   indeed, in our models, the magnitude of the effects of immigration
   attitudes surpasses the magnitude of effects of attitudes toward blacks.
   Further, our findings of immigration effects withstand a range of

   Evidence from a variety of identification strategies suggests that this

   it presents evidence from three original American surveys using

   firm-based egocentric variation: Individuals whose employer does most of
   its business in overseas markets have a lesser preference for domestic
   monetary autonomy. It also presents evidence from a survey experiment to
   show how the strength of this egocentric relationship depends on the

   vignette produces a stronger relationship between overseas business
   activity and a preference against domestic monetary autonomy.

   framework, problems of agency loss and time inconsistency leave citizens
   uncertain about whether promised policy benefits will be delivered.
   Citizen support for public investments thus depends on whether the

   consider hypotheses about how the institutional allocation of authority
   and the institutional rules governing implementation affect citizen
   support for public investment, and we find broad support for the
   framework in three survey experiments administered to representative

   theories, we conducted unique field experiments in cooperation with

   official communications with randomly assigned content. The legislators
   sometimes stated their issue positions in these letters, sometimes
   supported by extensive arguments but sometimes minimally justified; in

AB The last decade has seen substantial advances in statistical techniques
   for the analysis of network data, as well as a major increase in the
   frequency with which these tools are used. These techniques are designed
   to accomplish the same broad goal, statistically valid inference in the
   presence of highly interdependent relationships, but important
   differences remain between them. We review three approaches commonly
   used for inferential network analysisthe quadratic assignment procedure,
   exponential random graph models, and latent space network
   modelshighlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques
   relative to one another. An illustrative example using climate change
   policy network data shows that all three network models outperform
   standard logit estimates on multiple criteria. This article introduces
   political scientists to a class of network techniques beyond simple
   descriptive measures of network structure, and it helps researchers
   choose which model to use in their own research.

AB This article examines the mutually constitutive relationship between
   global institutions and local social movements. First, drawing on social
   movement theories and the world society approach, it develops a
   theoretical framework for understanding the transformative impact of
   global human rights on local activism. Using interviews and archival and
   other data sources, the empirical analysis demonstrates that global
   human rights galvanized (1) the politically dormant Ainu into a thriving
   indigenous rights movement, (2) the politically active but factious
   resident Koreans into a more united and successful social movement, and
   (3) an established Burakumin movement into an international human rights
   organization. The fundamental similarity of rising activism for all
   three groups supports the world society thesis, but in-depth examination
   of concrete mechanisms unpacks complex global-local interplay and
   reveals intranational diversity in the impact of global human rights.
   Second, drawing on organizational institutionalism, I examine how local
   activism feeds back to global institutions. The empirical analysis
   details how local actors consolidate and expand global human rights.

AB Since Durkheim, sociologists have believed that actors in dense network
   structures experience fewer norm violations. Coleman proposed one
   explanatory mechanism, arguing that dense networks provide an
   opportunity structure to reward those who punish norm violators, leading
   to more frequent punishment and in turn fewer norm violations. Despite
   ubiquitous scholarly references to Coleman's theory, little empirical
   work has directly tested it in large-scale natural settings with
   longitudinal data. The authors undertake such a test using records of
   norm violations during the editing process on Wikipedia, the largest
   user-generated online encyclopedia. These data allow them to track all
   three elements required to test Coleman's mechanism: norm violations,
   punishments for such violations, and rewards for those who punish
   violations. The results support Coleman's mechanism.

AB Actors and associates often match on a few dimensions that matter most
   for the relationship at hand. In so doing, they are exposed to
   unanticipated social influences because counterparts have broader
   attitudes and preferences than would-be contacts considered when they
   first chose to pair. The authors label as partially deliberate social
   matching that occurs on a small set of attributes, and they present
   empirical methods for identifying causal social influence effects when
   relationships follow this generative logic. A data set tracking the
   training and professional activities of academic biomedical scientists
   is used to show that young scientists adopt their advisers' orientations
   toward commercial science as evidenced by adviser-to-advisee
   transmission of patenting behavior. The authors demonstrate this in
   two-stage models that account for the endogeneity of matching, using
   both inverse probability of treatment weights and an instrumental
   variables approach. They also draw on qualitative methods to support a
   causal interpretation. Overall, they present a theory and a
   triangulation of methods to establish evidence of social influence when
   tie formation is partially deliberate.

   or personality type, and does not take into account the situational and
   fluctuating nature of attitudes. In this study, a survey experiment,
   subjects are presented with a mock news article designed to induce
   conspiracy belief. Subjects are randomly assigned three manipulations
   hypothesized to heighten conspiracy perceptions: a prime to induce
   anxiety; information about the putative conspirator; and the number and
   identifiability of the victim(s). The results indicate that
   conspiratorial perceptions can emerge from both situational triggers and
   subtle contextual variables. Conspiracy beliefs emerge as ordinary

AB Arrangements for sharing political power serve three purposes: to give
   all relevant groups access to important political decisions; to
   partition the policy process, thereby granting groups relevant autonomy;
   and to constrain holders of political power from abusing authority. A
   new global dataset of political power sharing institutions, 1975-2010,
   is introduced here, disaggregated these along three institutional
   dimensions: inclusive, dispersive, and constraining. Existing literature
   associates power sharing with democracy and civil conflict resolution.
   Unlike the existing literature, this dataset shows inclusive
   institutions are common in post-conflict states, though least strongly
   associated with electoral democracy. Conversely, constraining
   institutions, though comparatively rare in states with current or recent
   civil conflicts, are highly correlated with electoral democracy.

   relative to separate sales, bundling raises market prices, benefits
   firms, and harms consumers when the number of firms is above a threshold
   (which can be small). This is in contrast to the findings in the duopoly
   case on which the existing literature often focuses. Our analysis also
   sheds new light on how consumer valuation dispersion affects price

AB We develop econometric tools for studying jump dependence of two
   processes from high-frequency observations on a fixed time interval. In
   this context, only segments of data around a few outlying observations
   are informative for the inference. We derive an asymptotically valid
   test for stability of a linear jump relation over regions of the jump
   size domain. The test has power against general forms of nonlinearity in
   the jump dependence as well as temporal instabilities. We further
   propose an efficient estimator for the linear jump regression model that
   is formed by optimally weighting the detected jumps with weights based
   on the diffusive volatility around the jump times. We derive the
   asymptotic limit of the estimator, a semiparametric lower efficiency
   bound for the linear jump regression, and show that our estimator
   attains the latter. The analysis covers both deterministic and random
   jump arrivals. In an empirical application, we use the developed
   inference techniques to test the temporal stability of market jump
   betas.

   system states. In addition, we used different levels of visual salience
   to highlight the current unit and provided a list of execution history
   records. A laboratory experiment, with 42 students performing a
   simulated procedure to deal with unexpected high pressuriser level, was

   selected 1,381 households and randomly sampled 475 women between the

   about their sexual histories. More than half of them had engaged in
   transactional sex, a large majority of them (more than 75 percent) with
   UN personnel. We estimate that each additional battalion of UN
   peacekeepers caused a significant increase in a woman's probability of
   engaging in her first transactional sex. Our findings raise the concern
   that the private actions of UN personnel in the field may set back the
   UN's broader gender-equality and economic development goals, and raise
   broader questions about compliance with international norms.

   typically focus exclusively on government spending. This article
   explores how one determinant of social spendingracial
   compositioninfluences preferences for, and the structure of, tax
   systems. First, analyses of state and local tax burden data indicate
   that an increasing proportion of Latinos within states is associated
   with more regressive tax systems. Second, evidence from a nationally
   representative survey experiment suggests that individual preferences
   for taxation may be influenced by changes in the racial composition of
   communities. Finally, analyses reveal that in-group solidarity is a key
   mechanism through which racial threat shapes preferences for taxation.
   In demonstrating a relationship between racial change, tax preferences,

   the set of traded contracts is determined by free entry. Crucially for
   applications, contract characteristics are endogenously determined,
   consumers may have multiple dimensions of private information, and an
   equilibrium always exists. Equilibrium corresponds to the limit of a
   differentiated products Bertrand game. We apply the model to establish
   theoretical results on the equilibrium effects of mandates. Mandates can
   increase efficiency but have unintended consequences. With adverse
   selection, an insurance mandate reduces the price of low-coverage
   policies, which necessarily has indirect effects such as increasing
   adverse selection on the intensive margin and causing some consumers to
   purchase less coverage.

AB We explore the impact of private information in sealed-bid first-price
   auctions. For a given symmetric and arbitrarily correlated prior
   distribution over values, we characterize the lowest winning-bid
   distribution that can arise across all information structures and
   equilibria. The information and equilibrium attaining this minimum leave
   bidders indifferent between their equilibrium bids and all higher bids.
   Our results provide lower bounds for bids and revenue with asymmetric
   distributions over values. We also report further characterizations of
   revenue and bidder surplus including upper bounds on revenue. Our work
   has implications for the identification of value distributions from data
   on winning bids and for the informationally robust comparison of
   alternative auction mechanisms.

AB The availability of high frequency financial data has generated a series
   of estimators based on intra-day data, improving the quality of large
   areas of financial econometrics. However, estimating the standard error
   of these estimators is often challenging. The root of the problem is
   that traditionally, standard errors rely on estimating a theoretically
   derived asymptotic variance, and often this asymptotic variance involves
   substantially more complex quantities than the original parameter to be
   estimated.
   Standard errors are important: they are used to assess the precision of
   estimators in the form of confidence intervals, to create "feasible
   statistics" for testing, to build forecasting models based on, say,
   daily estimates, and also to optimize the tuning parameters.
   The contribution of this paper is to provide an alternative and general
   solution to this problem, which we call Observed Asymptotic Variance. It
   is a general nonparametric method for assessing asymptotic variance
   (AVAR). It provides consistent estimators of AVAR for a broad class of
   integrated parameters Theta = integral theta(t) dt, where the spot
   parameter process. can be a general semimartingale, with continuous and
   jump components. The observed AVAR is implemented with the help of a
   two-scales method. Its construction works well in the presence of
   microstructure noise, and when the observation times are irregular or
   asynchronous in the multivariate case.
   The methodology is valid for a wide variety of estimators, including the
   standard ones for variance and covariance, and also for more complex
   estimators, such as, of leverage effects, high frequency betas, and
   semivariance.

AB In this paper, we provide efficient estimators and honest confidence
   bands for a variety of treatment effects including local average (LATE)
   and local quantile treatment effects (LQTE) in data-rich environments.
   We can handle very many control variables, endogenous receipt of
   treatment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and function-valued
   outcomes. Our framework covers the special case of exogenous receipt of
   treatment, either conditional on controls or unconditionally as in
   randomized control trials. In the latter case, our approach produces
   efficient estimators and honest bands for (functional) average treatment
   effects (ATE) and quantile treatment effects (QTE). To make informative
   inference possible, we assume that key reduced-form predictive
   relationships are approximately sparse. This assumption allows the use
   of regularization and selection methods to estimate those relations, and
   we provide methods for post-regularization and post-selection inference
   that are uniformly valid (honest) across a wide range of models. We show
   that a key ingredient enabling honest inference is the use of orthogonal
   or doubly robust moment conditions in estimating certain reduced-form
   functional parameters. We illustrate the use of the proposed methods
   with an application to estimating the effect of 401(k) eligibility and
   participation on accumulated assets.
   The results on program evaluation are obtained as a consequence of more
   general results on honest inference in a general moment-condition
   framework, which arises from structural equation models in econometrics.
   Here, too, the crucial ingredient is the use of orthogonal moment
   conditions, which can be constructed from the initial moment conditions.
   We provide results on honest inference for (function-valued) parameters
   within this general framework where any high-quality, machine learning
   methods (e.g., boosted trees, deep neural networks, random forest, and
   their aggregated and hybrid versions) can be used to learn the
   nonparametric/high-dimensional components of the model. These include a
   number of supporting auxiliary results that are of major independent
   interest: namely, we (1) prove uniform validity of a multiplier
   bootstrap, (2) offer a uniformly valid functional delta method, and (3)
   provide results for sparsity-based estimation of regression functions
   for function-valued outcomes.

AB We introduce a Bayesian method, LASSOplus, that unifies recent
   contributions in the sparse modeling literatures, while substantially
   extending pre-existing estimators in terms of both performance and
   flexibility. Unlike existing Bayesian variable selection methods,
   LASSOplus both selects and estimates effects while returning estimated
   confidence intervals for discovered effects. Furthermore, we show how
   LASSOplus easily extends to modeling repeated observations and permits a
   simple Bonferroni correction to control coverage on confidence intervals
   among discovered effects. We situate LASSOplus in the literature on how
   to estimate subgroup effects, a topic that offen leads to a
   proliferation of estimation parameters. We also offer a simple
   preprocessing step that draws on recent theoretical work to estimate
   higher-order effects that can be interpreted independently of their
   lower-order terms. A simulation study illustrates the method's
   performance relative to several existing variable selection methods. In
   addition, we apply LASSOplus to an existing study on public support for
   climate treaties to illustrate the method's ability to discover
   substantive and relevant effects. Soffware implementing the method is
   publicly available in the R package sparsereg.

AB I develop a novel method to detect election fraud from irregular
   patterns in the distribution of vote-shares. I build on a widely
   discussed observation that in some elections where fraud allegations
   abound, suspiciously many polling stations return coarse vote-shares
   (e.g., 0.50, 0.60, 0.75) for the ruling party, which seems highly
   implausible in large electorates. Using analytical results and
   simulations, I showthat sheer frequency of such coarse vote-shares is
   entirely plausible due to simple numeric laws and does not by itself
   constitute evidence of fraud. To avoid false positive errors in fraud
   detection, I propose a resampled kernel density method (RKD) to measure
   whether the coarse vote-shares occur too frequently to raise a
   statistically qualified suspicion of fraud. I illustrate the method on
   election data from Russia and Canada as well as simulated data. A
   software package is provided for an easy implementation of the method.

AB Difference-in-differences (DID) is commonly used for causal inference in
   time-series cross-sectional data. It requires the assumption that the
   average outcomes of treated and control units would have followed
   parallel paths in the absence of treatment. In this paper, we propose a
   method that not only relaxes this offen-violated assumption, but also
   unifies the synthetic control method (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2
   0 1 0) with linear fixed effects models under a simple framework, of
   which DID is a special case. It imputes counterfactuals for each treated
   unit using control group information based on a linear interactive fixed
   effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with
   time-varying coefficients. This method has several advantages. First, it
   allows the treatment to be correlated with unobserved unit and time
   heterogeneities under reasonable modeling assumptions. Second, it
   generalizes the synthetic control method to the case of multiple treated
   units and variable treatment periods, and improves efficiency and
   interpretability. Third, with a built-in cross-validation procedure, it
   avoids specification searches and thus is easy to implement. An
   empirical example of Election Day Registration and voter turnout in the
   United States is provided.

AB Scholars of representation are increasingly interested in mass-elite

   because they ignore information in the data, require arbitrary decisions
   about quantization, and limit researchers to comparing masses and elites
   on a single dimension. We introduce a new measure of congruence-borrowed
   from computer science-that addresses all of these problems: the Earth
   Mover's Distance (EMD). We demonstrate its conceptual advantages and
   apply it to two debates in research on mass-elite congruence:
   ideological congruence in majoritarian and proportional systems and the
   determinants of congruence across countries in Latin America. We find
   that improving measurement using the EMD has important implications for
   inferences regarding both empirical debates. Even beyond studies of
   congruence, the EMD is a useful and reliable way for political
   scientists to compare distributions.

AB Researchers studying discrimination and bias frequently conduct

   ability of these experiments to speak to racial discrimination depends
   on the excludability assumption that subjects' responses to these names
   are driven by their reaction to the individual's putative race and not
   some other factor. We use results from an audit study with a large
   number of aliases and data from detailed public records to empirically
   test the excludability assumption undergirding the use of racially
   distinctive names. The detailed public records allow us to measure the
   signals about socioeconomic status and political resources that each
   name used in the study possibly could send. We then reanalyze the audit
   study to see whether these signals predict legislators' likelihood of
   responding. We find no evidence that politicians respond to this other
   information, thus providing empirical support for the excludability
   assumption.

AB Validly measuring sensitive issues such as norm violations or
   stigmatizing traits through self-reports in surveys is often
   problematic. Special techniques for sensitive questions like the
   Randomized Response Technique (RRT) and, among its variants, the recent
   crosswise model should generate more honest answers by providing full
   response privacy. Different types of validation studies have examined
   whether these techniques actually improve data validity, with varying
   results. Yet, most of these studies did not consider the possibility of
   false positives, i.e., that respondents are misclassified as having a
   sensitive trait even though they actually do not. Assuming that
   respondents only falsely deny but never falsely admit possessing a
   sensitive trait, higher prevalence estimates have typically been
   interpreted as more valid estimates. If false positives occur, however,
   conclusions drawn under this assumption might be misleading. We present
   a comparative validation design that is able to detect false positives
   without the need for an individual-level validation criterion - which is
   often unavailable. Results show that the most widely used
   crosswise-model implementation produced false positives to a
   nonignorable extent. This defect was not revealed by several previous
   validation studies that did not consider false positives - apparently a
   blind spot in past sensitive question research.

AB Parametric and nonparametric duration models assume proportional
   hazards: The effect of a covariate on the hazard rate stays constant
   over time. Researchers have developed techniques to test and correct
   nonproportional hazards, including interacting the covariates with some
   function of time. Including this interaction term means that the
   specification now involves time-varying covariates, and the model
   specification should reflect this feature. However, in situations with
   no time-varying covariates initially, researchers often continue to
   model the duration with only time-invariant covariates. This error
   results in biased estimates, particularly for the covariates interacted
   with time. We investigate this issue in over forty political science
   articles and find that of those studies that begin with time-invariant
   covariates and correct for nonproportional hazards the majority suffer
   from incorrect model specification. Proper estimation usually produces

   authoritarian elites own a high share of economic assets, this
   aggravates the economic loss of both the business class and the masses

AB This article tests contextual and individual-level explanations of the
   gender gap in political knowledge in Latin American countries. It
   suggests that this gap is impacted by political and economic settings
   through two interrelated mechanisms: gender accessibility (that is, the
   extent of available opportunities for women to influence the political
   agenda) and gender-bias signaling (that is, the extent to which women
   play important roles in the public sphere). Analyzing data from the 2008
   Americas Barometer survey, this study shows that the gender gap in
   political knowledge is smaller among highly educated citizens, in rural
   areas (where both men and women know little about politics) and in
   bigger cities (where women's levels of political knowledge are higher).
   More importantly, the magnitude of the gap varies greatly across
   countries. Gender differences in income, party system
   institutionalization and the representation of women in national
   parliaments are all found to play a particularly important role in

TI The Incumbency Bonus Revisited: Causes and Consequences of Media
   Dominance

AB The literature on political actors' media appearances has repeatedly
   documented the so-called incumbency bonus (that parties and politicians
   in government have more media coverage than those in the opposition).
   This bias is normally attributed to news criteria that reflect political
   power, such as relevance and the elite status of actors. Supplementing
   existing perspectives, this study puts forward a new explanation of the
   incumbency bonus. The article argues that variations in the media
   dominance of incumbents are the result of the interplay between
   journalistic norms and political context. Outside election campaigns,
   political news is driven by the 'watch dog' norm. Thus the media focus
   on societal problems, which produces a critical emphasis on incumbent
   actors. But when party competition intensifies, either during campaigns
   or when issues become salient, the norm of objective and impartial
   journalism results in a more balanced coverage where challengers
   increase their presence. The argument receives support through
   multivariate models of incumbent and challenger appearances in Danish
   radio news broadcasts over a twenty-year period. Finally, in terms of
   democratic implications, the importance of the watchdog norm challenges
   the assumption that the incumbency bonus constitutes an electoral asset.
   Since media dominance is closely related to government responsibility
   for all kinds of problems, incumbent support is found to dwindle with
   increased media appearances.

AB How do electoral rules affect the composition of governments? It is a
   robust finding that countries with majoritarian rules more often elect
   conservative governments than those with proportional representation
   (PR) electoral systems. There are three explanations for this pattern.
   The first stresses the impact of voting behaviour: the middle class more
   often votes for right-wing parties in majoritarian electoral systems,
   anticipating governments' redistributive consequences. The second
   explanation is based on electoral geography: the regional distribution
   of votes may bias the vote-seat translation against the Left in
   majoritarian systems due to the wide margins by which the Left wins core
   urban districts. The third explanation refers to party fragmentation: if
   the Right is more fragmented than the Left in countries with PR, then
   there is less chance of a right-wing party gaining formateur status.
   This study tests these three hypotheses for established democracies over
   the entire post-war period. It finds the first two mechanisms at work in
   the democratic chain of delegation from voting via the vote-seat
   translation to the formation of cabinets, while party fragmentation does
   not seem to co-vary as much as expected with electoral rules. These
   findings confirm that majoritarian systems have a substantive
   conservative bias, whereas countries with PR show more differentiated
   patterns.

AB If deeply divided societies are to make the move from conflict to peace
   and democracy, their communities must pull together. While togetherness
   can be construed in different ways, its basic logic can be spelt out in
   terms of the notion of a 'shared intention'. Accordingly, the burden of
   this article is to argue that developing shared intentions between
   conflicting communities is important for overcoming their conflict and
   to explain why deliberation is a better instrument than bargaining for
   developing them. Deliberation involves and promotes more extensive and
   robust shared intentions than bargaining and hence enables a stronger
   sense of togetherness between communities to emerge.

   systematic review of the state of the art and outlines an agenda for a
   comparative analysis of the warfare-welfare state nexus that is informed
   by an explicit consideration of the underlying causal mechanisms. By
   distinguishing between three different phases (war preparation, warfare
   and post-war period) it provides a systematic overview of possible
   causal mechanisms linking war and the welfare state and a discussion of
   likely effects of war for belligerent, occupied and neutral countries in
   the age of mass warfare stretching approximately from the 1860s to the
   1960s.

AB In many markets, goods flow from initial producers to final customers
   travelling through many layers of intermediaries and information is
   asymmetric. We study a dynamic model of bargaining in networks that
   captures these features. We show that the equilibrium price demanded
   over time is non-monotonic, but the sequence of transaction prices
   declines over time, with the possible exception of the last period. The
   price dynamic is, therefore, reminiscent of fire-sales and hot-potato
   trading. Traders who intermediate the object arise endogenously and make
   a positive profit. The profit-earning intermediaries are not necessarily
   traders with many connections; for the case of multilayer networks, they
   belong to the path that reaches the maximum number of potential buyers
   using the minimal number of intermediaries. This is not necessarily the
   path of the network that maximizes the probability of consumption by
   traders who value the most the object (i.e. welfare).

AB We study a principal-agent setting in which both sides learn about
   future profitability from output, and the project can be
   abandoned/terminated if profitability is too low. With learning,
   shirking by the agent both reduces output and lowers the principal's
   estimate of future profitability. The agent can exploit this belief
   discrepancy and earn information rents, reducing his incentives to exert
   effort. The optimal contract controls information rents to improve
   incentives by distorting the termination decision. Our results capture
   the transition from a young, financially constrained firm to a mature
   firm that pays dividends. For young firms, poor performance permanently
   raises the termination threshold, as doing so lowers information rents.
   Mature firms pay smoothed dividends and have a fixed termination
   threshold. Dividend smoothing occurs because earnings surprises are used
   to adjust financial slack in line with profitability. When profitability
   only reflects the agent's private ability, a simple equity contract is
   optimal.

AB Theories of rebellion and revolution neglect short-run processes within
   state structures that can undermine their internal cohesion. These
   processes are evident in the rapid unraveling of the Chinese state early
   in the Cultural Revolution. Portrayed in past accounts as a culmination
   of student and worker insurgencies, an early 1967 wave of power seizures
   was in fact accelerated by an internal rebellion of bureaucrats against
   their own superiors. These led to the widespread collapse of local
   governments, diverting the course of the Cultural Revolution and forcing
   intervention by the armed forces. An event-history analysis of the
   diffusion of power seizures across a hierarchy of 2,215 government
   jurisdictions portrays a top-down cascade that spread deeply into rural
   regions with few students and workers and little popular protest. The
   internal rebellions were generated endogenously by events during the
   course of these upheavals, as individual officials reacted to shifting
   circumstances that threatened their positions.

AB Why do states make claims to some border areas and not others? We
   articulate three models of territorial claims and test them using a
   novel geospatial data set that precisely maps disputed and undisputed
   border segments in post-independence Africa. The geospatial approach
   helps eliminate problems of aggregation by permitting an analysis of
   variation both within and between dyadic borders. We find that ethnic
   political considerations are the most important driver of territorial
   claims in Africa, while institutional features of the border play a
   secondary role. Border segments that partition ethnic groups are at
   greatest risk of being challenged when the partitioned groups are
   politically powerful in ethnically homogeneous societies. Border
   segments that follow well-established and clear focal principles such as
   rivers and watersheds are significantly less likely to be disputed,
   while changes to the border in the colonial period created opportunities
   for later disputes to arise. Power considerations or resources play only
   a minor role in explaining the location of territorial claims.

AB This paper challenges the long-standing belief that changes in patterns
   of war and war making caused the emergence of large territorial states.
   Using new data describing the universe of European states between 1100
   and 1790, I find that small political units continued to thrive well
   into the age of the territorial state. Some scholars have argued that
   changes in the production of violence led to the dominance of
   geographically large political units during this era. In contrast, I
   find evidence that variation in patterns of economic development and
   urban growth caused fragmented political authority in some places and
   the construction of geographically large territorial states in others.
   Exploiting random climatic deviations in the propensity of certain
   geographical areas to support large populations, I show via an
   instrumental-variables approach that the emergence of towns and cities
   caused the formation of small and independent states.

AB This paper argues that the climate came to take on a geophysical rather
   than a bioecological form in global governance because it emerged from a
   dynamic, interactive process between states and scientists. In the
   1950s, state agencies, especially elements of the US military, steered
   and accelerated the development of the geophysical sciences, which set
   the discursive frame within which climate politics now plays out. In the
   1990s, scientists and IO experts responded to states' requests to study
   carbon sinks by expanding the climate to include new greenhouse gases
   and land-use practices. Drawing on Science and Technology Studies as
   well as discursive theories of global governance, I theorize object
   constitution as a process of co-production in which states steer the
   development of scientific knowledge and scientists assemble epistemic
   objects. This contingent interaction of political and scientific actors
   shapes the form and content of global governance objects. The argument
   extends and challenges the epistemic communities literature and theories
   of the global governance life cycle that focus on how problems end up on
   the agenda of states rather than the processes of problem construction.

AB It remains contested whether peacekeeping works. The impact of
   peacekeepers' actions at the local subnational level for overall mission
   success has lately received critical attention. Local peacekeeping is
   expected to matter because it reassures local actors, deters resumption
   of armed hostilities, coerces parties to halt fighting, and makes
   commitment to agreements credible. Thus peacekeepers affect the
   relations between central and local elites and avoid the emergence of
   local power vacuums and areas of lawlessness. This study uses new
   subnational data on the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers. It
   uses matching and recursive bivariate probit models with exogenous
   variables for temporal and spatial variation to deal with possible
   nonrandom assignment of the treatment. We demonstrate that conflict
   episodes last for shorter periods when peacekeepers are deployed to
   conflict-prone locations inside a country, even with comparatively
   modest deployment. The effect of peacekeeping on the onset of local
   conflict is, however, less clear cut.

AB It is often said that the only constant is change itself. As time
   passes, the population grows, new technologies are invented, and the
   skills, demographics, and norms of the populace evolve. These changes,
   whether in isolation or in aggregate, influence the effectiveness of
   policy. In particular, policies designed for today's world are unlikely
   to provide a perfect fit tomorrow. We develop a notion of policy decay
   that captures this impact formally. We introduce policy decay into a
   paradigmatic model of legislative policymaking and show that it leads to
   a starkly different perspective on legislative politics. Our results
   upend the classic notion of gridlock and bear implications more broadly
   for the practice of politics. We show how a changing world impacts the
   power of agenda control, how it drives the dynamic path of legislation,
   how it reveals a novel conception of policy expertise, and how it,
   ultimately, provides a foundational logic to the design of bureaucracy.

AB Citizens' social policy opinions are strongly influenced by a simple
   heuristic: Are the recipients of social benefits deserving or not?
   Adding to this growing literature, we provide evidence that the
   deservingness heuristic does not treat all social benefits alike.
   Already at the level of preconscious processing, the heuristic displays
   a bias toward tagging the recipients of health carethat is, sick
   individualsas deserving. This powerful, implicit effect overrides other
   opinion factors and produces broad-based support among the public for
   health careacross levels of self-interest, media frames, ideological
   divides, and national cultures. In contrast, when the deservingness
   heuristic is utilized for reasoning about unemployment benefits,
   implicit psychological constraints are fewer and political conflict
   erupts depending on differences in interest and worldviews. Using a
   variety of methodologies, we track this fundamental difference between
   the politics of health care and unemployment benefits from the level of
   implicit processing to the level of political attitudes.

   the kin group in the irredentist state, its coethnic enclave, and the
   host state, and provides new data on all actual and potential
   irredentist cases from 1946 to 2014. The results indicate that
   irredentism is more likely when the kin group is near economic parity
   with other groups in its own state, which results in status
   inconsistency and engenders grievances. It is also more likely in more
   ethnically homogeneous countries with winner-take-all majoritarian
   systems where the kin group does not need to moderate its policy to win
   elections by attracting other groups. These conditions generate both the
   grievance and opportunity for kin groups to pursue irredentism.

   may craft different messages to target different winning coalitions in
   order to influence the outcome. If access to legislators is costly, then
   interest groups prefer to coordinate with allied legislators by
   providing them with information that helps them to persuade less
   sympathetic legislators. The model reconciles informational theories of
   lobbying with empirical evidence suggesting that interest groups
   predominantly lobby those who already agree with them. The model also
   makes new predictions about the welfare effects of interest group
   influence: From an ex ante perspective, informational lobbying
   negatively affects the welfare of legislators. The results highlight the

AB In contemporary Confucian political theory, there is surprisingly little
   effort among the theorists to illuminate the value of democracy. When
   they do on rare occasions, their focus is largely on democracy's
   instrumental contribution to Confucian goods. In this paper, I argue
   that, given democracy's dual aspects as a political system and as a way
   of life, it has both instrumental and intrinsic values, and insomuch as
   it is a kind of democracy, Confucian democracy, too, ought to possess
   both values. Central to my argument is that, once introduced and
   justified instrumentally as a political system, democracy in a Confucian
   society attains its noninstrumental value as it becomes consolidated as
   a democratic-Confucian way of life in which democratic institutions,
   rights, and practices are socially mediated by and negotiated with
   Confucian values, civilities, and moral sentiments. I present my
   overarching normative framework in terms of pragmatic Confucian
   democracy.

AB Latino immigrant presence in urban neighborhoods has been linked with
   reduced neighborhood cohesion in social disorganization-based ethnic
   heterogeneity hypotheses and enhanced cohesion in immigration
   revitalization approaches. Using the 2000-2002 Los Angeles Family and
   Neighborhood Survey and the 1994-1995 Project on Human Development in
   Chicago Neighborhoods Community Survey, we explore the association
   between Latino immigrant concentration and both levels of, and agreement
   about, neighborhood collective efficacy. Findings from multilevel models
   with heteroskedastic variance indicate that Latino immigrant
   concentration exhibits a nonlinear association with collective efficacy.
   At low levels, increases in Latino immigrant concentration diminish
   collective efficacy, consistent with a heterogeneity hypothesis. The
   negative association between Latino immigrant concentration and
   collective efficacy declines in magnitude as immigrant concentration
   increases and, particularly in LA, becomes positive beyond a threshold,
   consistent with an immigration revitalization effect. We also find an
   inverse nonlinear pattern of association with the variance of collective
   efficacy. At low levels, increasing Latino immigrant concentration
   increases the variance of collective efficacy (reflecting more
   disagreement), but beyond a threshold, this association becomes negative
   (reflecting increasing agreement). This pattern is observed in both LA
   and Chicago. The prevalence of social interaction and reciprocated
   exchange within neighborhoods explains a modest proportion of the Latino
   immigrant concentration effect on mean levels of collective efficacy in
   Chicago, but does little to explain effects on the mean in LA or effects
   on the variance in either LA or Chicago. These findings offer insight
   into the complex role Latino immigrant presence plays in shaping
   neighborhood social climate.

AB We investigate claims originating in the work of Daniel Bell that in
   post-industrial societies, educational qualifications obtained prior to
   labour market entry increasingly determine individuals' class
   positions-while opportunities for achieving upward class mobility over
   the course of working life correspondingly diminish. We apply optimal
   matching techniques of sequence analysis as a basis for constructing
   typologies of class histories for men and women in three British birth
   cohorts, whose lives span the period from the mid-twentieth to the early
   twenty-first century. We find a steady increase across the cohorts in
   class histories characterized by entry into, and stability within,
   managerial and professional positions and associated with relatively
   high levels of qualification. However, there is no decline in class
   histories characterized by upward mobility; and, while there are clear
   associations between education and most types of class history that we
   distinguish, the effects of education are systematically and
   persistently reinforced, or modified, by the independent effects of
   early life cognitive ability and of class origins. In Britain at least,
   there is little indication of movement towards an education-based
   meritocracy, and educational level at labour market entry is today no
   more class destiny than it was half a century ago.

   Using the Fragile Families Study, I assess whether having an
   incarcerated father impacts children's cognitive skill development into
   middle childhood. While previous studies have primarily found effects
   for boys' behavior problems, matching models and sensitivity analyses
   demonstrate that experiencing paternal incarceration by age nine is
   associated with lower cognitive skills for both boys and girls, and
   these negative effects hold net of a pre-paternal incarceration measure
   of child cognitive ability. Moreover, I estimate that paternal
   incarceration explains between 2 and 15 percent of the Black-White
   achievement gap at age nine. These findings represent new outcomes of
   importance and suggest that paternal incarceration may play an even
   larger role in the production of intergenerational inequalities for
   American children than previously documented.

AB The topic of transnational partner choice has gained attention over the
   past decades, but most research focuses on the migrants and their
   descendants in Europe. Very little is known about the mechanisms
   underlying marriage migration decisions in the sending contexts. With
   reference to migration and partner choice theories, we develop
   hypotheses on (1) education-related selectivity, (2) family and
   community network effects, and (3) the role of consanguineous and
   arranged marriages for family formation migrations from Turkey. Drawing
   on data of the 2000 Families Study, we apply multivariate regression
   models which consider (married) stayers and marriage migrants from the
   same regions of origin. Findings indicate the expected inverted u-curved
   effect of education and strong positive influences of prior migrants in
   the family network. Previous marriage migrants exert a stronger
   influence than other migrants in the family. Gender differences are low,
   but while family networks hardly diminish the selective impact of
   education for women, we find a negative interaction effect for men.
   Unlike the family, community network effects are low and inconclusive.
   Moreover, marriage migration is strongly associated with consanguineous
   marriage, and less with marriage arrangement. The implications of these
   findings are discussed in the light of existing theoretical and
   empirical research.

   England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden (n = 18,716), using new
   comparative data (Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four

   we find that despite potential problems with acculturation and social
   stress, children of immigrants-particularly from geographically and
   culturally distant countries-report systematically fewer internalizing
   and externalizing problems than the majority population, thus supporting
   the 'immigrant health paradox' found in some studies. However,
   surprisingly, we do not find that this minority advantage changes with
   time in the destination country. Externalizing problems are most
   prevalent in our English sample, and overall Swedish adolescents show
   the least mental health problems. A plausible account of our results is
   that there is a positive selection of immigrants on some persistent and

AB This study examines whether the likelihood of job loss varies by
   immigrant status and economic periods. In addition, it asks how the
   immigrant-native differences in job loss change under volatile economic
   conditions in the highly segmented Spanish labour market. Our study
   takes advantage of the current economic crisis to test several
   hypotheses that draw upon detailed longitudinal data from a sample of
   working males aged 16-64 years from the Spanish Labour Force Survey over
   the period 2005-2010. A series of random-effect logistic models and
   decomposition models reveal three central findings. First, we find that
   compositional differences in structural factors like occupational level
   and temporary employment contracts account for the major part of the
   difference in the job loss between immigrants and natives. Secondly, we
   find that during the Great Recession the likelihood of job loss is
   disproportionally higher among immigrants than natives. Thirdly, we find
   a significant increase in the unexplained portion of job loss contingent
   upon workers' ethnicity. Our results implicate that group differences in
   employment during economic downturns are more likely related to
   employers' firing practices that vary strongly with the economic
   context.

AB The article investigates how demographic trends influenced households'
   abilities to compensate for low or lacking earnings among their members.
   I focus on the probability that household earnings excluding those of
   the respondent are above the poverty threshold. The share of households
   where this is the case declined sharply between 1993-1996 and 2009-2012,
   implying a deterioration of households' potential to hedge labour market
   risks. The growing importance of single-adult households partly explains
   the decline, but the negative trend is also found for women living with
   a partner. Increased female labour force participation counterbalances
   the general trend for men in couple households. A comparison by
   individual economic status shows that the availability of earnings from
   other household members decreases more for persons with lower
   educational levels and the unemployed. Contrary to expectations, the
   uneven development of the share of single adults between social strata
   and the increasing correlation of spouses' employment status explain
   only part of this increasing spread of household resources. Overall, the
   results underline the importance of changes in household resources for
   the increase in poverty in Germany overall, as well as for growing
   disparities between poverty risks by individual employment status and
   education.

AB Previous research has shown that educational transitions are decisive
   for the explanation of social educational inequalities. One key factor
   for social-class-specific transitions at crucial branching points in the
   educational system is the difference in educational decisions of higher
   and lower social classes even at the same level of performance.
   Therefore, it is often assumed that an institutional setting in which
   families do not have a free choice, but where transitions are determined
   by binding teacher recommendations that are based on educational
   performance, is one possibility to reduce social inequality in
   educational opportunity. To test the effectiveness of such an
   institutional arrangement, we use Germany as a strategic test case. We
   investigate differences in social inequality in educational attainment
   between German federal states with differing transition rules and
   examine two changes in the transition regulations that have taken place
   in one federal state within the past 10 years. Our results indicate that
   the binding nature of the transition recommendation given by primary
   schools for the different secondary school types does not substantially
   alter the effect of social background on the probability of attending
   the higher secondary school track in secondary level I.

AB We use the British Cohort Study 1970 to show that the proportion of
   children achieving a tertiary education degree is 8 percentage points
   lower for the offspring of separated parents than for children from
   intact families. Moreover, the children of highly educated parents
   experience a two times larger 'separation penalty' than the children of
   less educated parents. We find a similar pattern of heterogeneity in
   effects for the likelihood of participation in academic education
   (A-Levels) beyond school leaving age but not for school grades at age
   16. We test three different explanations for heterogeneity in the
   parental separation penalty: changes in family relations, changes in
   income, and negative selection into separation based on unobserved
   characteristics. We address the potential endogeneity of parental
   separation by including pre-separation observable characteristics,
   individual fixed effects models, and a placebo test. Our key finding is
   that changes in family income, but not those in family relations or
   selection, explain a large part of heterogeneity in the effects of
   parental separation. Children with more highly educated parents face a
   larger decline in family income if parents separate and, in addition,
   declines in family income of equal amounts entail more negative
   consequences for their educational attainment.

AB This article examines the effect of becoming a first-time mother and
   subsequent, or concurrent, transitions to lone parenthood on women's
   employment and wages. Using longitudinal British Household Panel Survey
   data and fixed-effect models we find the arrival of a first child to
   have a substantial effect on employment and wages (n = 1,133
   individuals; 13,369 observations). Employment rates fall 20 percentage
   points (ppt), and fulltime employment 44-ppt, following a first child's
   birth and do not recover with time. Mothers that remain in work also see
   a sharp drop in the rate of wage growth following childbirth. Yet, in
   spite of predictions that lone mothers may face greater difficulties
   combining work and childcare, and therefore suffer greater labour market
   penalties than mothers with partners, we find little evidence of
   additional penalties to lone motherhood. There is some evidence of
   heterogeneity in the relationship between motherhood and employment
   outcomes by education. Overall we conclude that addressing the problems
   of low employment and earnings among British lone mothers will require
   policymakers to deal with the high economic cost of motherhood.

AB Occupational heterogeneity in non-standard employment is an important
   and policy-relevant topic of investigation, and one which has not
   received sufficient attention. The main thesis of this article is that
   the function of fixed-term contracts, which in turn affects the
   situation and career prospects of employees, is dependent on occupation.
   Using data from European Survey of Income and Living Conditions,
   2005-2008, I investigate the heterogeneities among fixed-term employees
   in various occupational categories in Poland, by analysing differences
   in (i) the demographic and socio-economic composition of temporary
   workers, (ii) the size of the wage penalty for fixed-term employment,
   and (iii) the chances of transition from fixed-term into open-ended
   employment. The results suggest that in managerial and professional
   occupations temporary contracts are more likely to be used during trial
   periods for newly hired workers and may serve as stepping stones to
   stable jobs, as reflected by the higher rates of mobility into
   open-ended employment. Temporary jobs in low-status service and manual
   occupations appear to result mainly from employers' attempts to
   facilitate worker dismissal rather than their need to verify the skills
   of new employees, and are more likely to become a dead end for workers.
   However, although fixed-term workers in higher-status occupations seem
   to be better off than their counterparts in services, trade, and manual
   labour, the evidence does not support the claim that the former resemble
   the so-called 'boundaryless' employees, who suffer no negative
   consequences of their fixed-term status.

   in an unobtrusive manner and identify potential causal effects of
   intra-EU labour immigration on attitudes towards welfare spending. We
   find a high degree of manifest and concealed welfare chauvinism. The
   tendency is especially strong among women. We also identify a negative
   effect of intra-EU labour migration on social spending preferences per

AB Schedule control can have both positive-e.g., increased income-and
   negative outcomes-e.g., increased overtime. Here our core interest is
   whether there are gender discrepancies in these outcomes. Given the
   different ways in which schedule control can be used, and perceived to
   be used by men and women, their outcomes are also expected to be
   different. This is examined using the German Socio-Economic Panel Study
   (SOEP) (2003-2011), and panel regression models. The results show that
   schedule control is associated with increases in overtime and income-but
   only for men. Women in full-time positions also increase their overtime
   hours when using schedule control; yet, they do not receive similar
   financial rewards. The results of this study provide evidence to show
   that increases in schedule control has the potential to traditionalize
   gender roles by increasing mainly men's working hours, while also adding
   to the gender pay gap.

AB There is anecdotal evidence that since the late 20th century young,
   educated, and urban Muslim women veil more frequently and strictly. Does
   this imply that the classical sociological theories of religion, which
   predict that modernization should cause a decrease in religious
   behaviours, do not apply to Islam? We investigate this question using
   structural equation modelling to analyse three datasets, one from
   Turkey, one covering 25 Muslim countries, and one from Belgium where
   Muslims are a minority. We find that averagely religious women conform
   to the classical theories' predictions. But among highly religious women
   the modernizing forces-education, occupation and higher income, urban
   living, and contacts with non-Muslims-increase veiling. We conjecture
   that for highly religious women modernizing factors raise the risk and
   temptation in women's environments that imperil their reputation for
   modesty: veiling would then be a strategic response, a form either of
   commitment to prevent the breach of religious norms or of signalling
   women's piety to their communities. Our findings have implications for
   cultural policy and Muslim integration in Europe.

AB The persistence of gender inequalities in the division of paid and
   unpaid work poses an important question for gender socialization
   research: what matters most for the intergenerational transmission of
   genderrole attitudes, parental own attitudes, or parental behaviours?
   Recent explanations in cultural economics suggest that intentional
   attitudinal transmission is the main driver of cultural reproduction. In
   line with classical sex-role learning models, we contend, however, that
   what parents do is at least as important as what parents say for
   gender-role transmission. Using data for British children aged between
   11 and 15 we estimate the independent influence of each of these two
   socialization channels on children's attitudes towards the sexual
   division of labour (ASDL). We show that both parental attitudes and
   parental behaviours are crucial in the formation of children's ASDL, and
   that parental influences are stronger when they operate through same-sex
   dyads. We also show that mothers' time out of the labour force is a
   stronger predictor of children's ASDL than either mothers' or fathers'
   own attitudes. Finally, analysis of a subset of the children followed
   into their early adult lives shows that ASDL formed in childhood have
   significant and lasting consequences for both adults' gender attitudes
   and their behaviours.

   their inclusion in analysis. We use longitudinal fixed-effects models to
   address the relationship between housework hours and spousal resources
   based on yearly couples' data from the nationally representative British

   capital, we find change in wives' own human capital to be the most

AB Over the past four decades, and especially in the aftermath of the 9/11
   attacks, many countries around the world have passed various types of
   counterterrorist legislation. It remains unclear, however, whether such
   laws are effective in achieving their most important declared goal:
   reducing terrorist activities. Some scholars believe that
   counterterrorist legislation should indeed reduce terrorist activities
   through protecting people and infrastructure, disrupting terrorist
   plots, and deterring some potential terrorists. Others, however, remain
   doubtful, suggesting that such legislation often serves merely as lip
   service or, worse, actually contributes to increasing terrorist
   activities. Using a newly assembled database on national-level
   counterterrorist legislation, I conduct a cross-national time-series
   analysis of legislation and subsequent terrorism for the years
   1981-2009. The analyses demonstrate a discrepancy between the short-and
   long-term effects of national-level counterterrorist legislation. In the
   short term, laws have no effect on the number of terrorist attacks and
   their severity. In the long term, however, the cumulative effects of
   most legislation are counterproductive and harmful, although some types
   of legislation do produce beneficial results and are associated with a
   reduction in future attacks.

AB Drawing from an ethnographic study of fasting among converts to Eastern
   Orthodox Christianity in the United States, this article develops a
   conceptualization of embodied metaphor as a form of cultural cognition
   in action. The findings demonstrate that fasting reshaped converts'
   subjectivities and subsequent actions through the creation of a series
   of metaphorical associations between concrete, bodily experiences
   related to food, hunger, and appetite and more abstract religious
   discourses pertaining to the soul, sin, and the acquisition of religious
   virtue. While current influential models of cultural cognition in
   sociology have focused on explaining the divide between cognition at the
   semantic level of discourse (i.e., discursive consciousness) and the
   somatic level of bodily perception and habit (i.e., practical
   consciousness), this study argues that embodied metaphor is a cognitive
   process that accounts for the dynamic, mutually informing interactions
   between these two cognitive registers. By way of conclusion, I argue for
   the broader theoretical, methodological, and empirical significance of
   this study for sociological scholarship on culture and cognition.

AB This study examines the marriage market in urban China through the lens
   of intersectionality, investigating how structural inequalities shape
   rural-urban intermarriage preferences and opportunities. Using 134
   semistructured interviews with participants from migrant-sending and
   -receiving regions of China, I find that China's household registration
   system (hukou), which assigns people to "rural" or "urban," creates a
   social hierarchy favorable to urban people. This hierarchy, in turn,
   creates a hukou-based gender system in which various types of
   masculinities and femininities are constructed along rural-urban lines.
   These masculinities and femininities then guide preferences for
   intermarriage among different groups. The urban form of masculinity is
   revered by most women, while rural migrant men find urban femininity
   undesirable. Rural femininity is agreeable to most urban and rural hukou
   holders, yet less so among urban local men for fear of status loss. I
   find that urban local husbands who marry rural migrant women either live
   on the social margins or are paired with rural wives that display urban
   ideals of beauty and manners, compensating for their "rural"
   disadvantages. Overall, people's intermarriage preferences illuminate
   the persistence of hukou barriers and gender inequalities.

AB We argue that the divergence in fertility trends in advanced societies
   is influenced by the interaction of long-standing differences in
   generalized trust with the increase in women's educational attainment.
   Our argument builds on the idea that trust enhances individuals' and
   couples' willingness to outsource childcare to outside their extended
   family. This becomes critically important as women's increased education
   leads to greater demand for combining work and family life. We test our
   hypothesis using data from the World Values Survey and European Values
   Study on 36 industrialized countries between the years 1981 and 2009.
   Multilevel statistical analyses reveal that the interaction between
   national-level generalized trust and cohort-level women's education is
   positively associated with completed fertility. As education among women
   expands, high levels of generalized trust moderate fertility decline.

AB For many, work interferes with their home life. To mitigate this
   encroachment, many welfare states have legislated shorter workweeks.
   Yet, the effectiveness of this policy on work-to-family interference is
   mixed, thus requiring additional investigation. We address this gap by
   applying multilevel data pairing the 2005 International Social Survey
   Programme (ISSP) for individuals in 32 nations (N = 20,937) with
   country-level measures of legislated weekly work hours, mean reported
   weekly work hours (aggregated and differentiated by gender), and
   individualistic/collectivist orientations. We find that legislated work
   hours have no impact on individuals' reports of work-to-family
   interference. By contrast, shorter normative weekly work hours,
   aggregated and by gender, are associated with greater individual
   work-to-family interference. We find an equivalent pattern in
   individualistic countries. While we document individual-level gender and
   parental differences, we find no differential effects of long workweeks
   for these groups. We explain these associations through the heightened
   expectations perspective, arguing that increased resources heighten
   expectations of work-life balance and sensitivity to work-to-family
   interference.

AB This study analyzes patterns of cross-cultural variability and
   convergence in two categories of human rights: bodily integrity
   (protection from torture, extrajudicial killing, and other forms of
   physical repression) and civil liberties (the freedoms of expression,
   assembly, movement, and religion). Countries are delineated into twelve
   cultural zones based primarily on predominant religious tradition and
   secondarily on geographical region. The core hypothesis predicts that
   respect for bodily integrity rights, which seeks to protect biological
   beings from physical harm, will vary less across cultures than respect
   for civil liberties, which empowers social and cultural entities to be
   self-determining agents. Individuals' capacity for pain and suffering is
   thought to be universal, but conceptions of the bounded and autonomous
   actor are culturally constructed and hence variable across cultures.
   Statistical analyses support this hypothesis: compared with civil
   liberties scores, cross-cultural variation in bodily integrity scores is
   much lower and also less durable in the presence of control variables.
   Moreover, whereas civil liberties scores are substantially higher in
   Western countries than in the rest of the world, cross-cultural
   variability in bodily integrity scores is gradational rather than
   polarized.

AB Though many studies have described societal-wide changes in tolerance
   for sexual behaviors outside marriage, few have examined how the social
   distribution of tolerant attitudes has changed. A
   diffusion-of-innovations approach predicts nonlinear change in the
   distribution: high SES groups adopt the attitudes first, which produces
   a positive relationship, but diffusion to other SES groups subsequently
   weakens the association with SES. I test this argument using the General
   Social Survey from 1973 to 2014 to compare the SES determinants of
   attitudes toward premarital sex, extramarital sex, same-gender sex, and
   teenage sex across 86 cohorts born from around 1900 to 1985. Multilevel
   age, period, and cohort models support diffusion arguments concerning
   tolerance of premarital sex by demonstrating that the effects of
   indicators of SES first strengthen and then weaken across cohorts.
   Little support emerges for diffusion arguments concerning tolerance of
   extramarital sex and teenage sex, and preliminary but suggestive support
   emerges concerning tolerance of same-gender sex.

   Integrating several data sets on protest, media, and political agendas,
   we demonstrate that media coverage of protest affects parliamentary
   agendas: the more media attention protest on an issue receives, the more
   parliamentary questions on that issue are asked. The relationship,
   however, is mediated by the issue agenda of mass media more generally,
   attesting to an indirect rather than a direct effect. Additionally, the
   effect of media-covered protests on the general media agenda is
   moderated by the political system and is larger in majoritarian
   countries than in countries with a consensus democracy. This shows the
   importance of political opportunity structures for the agenda-setting
   impact of protest.

AB Based on her analysis of published tables from US homemakers' 1924-32
   week-long time use diaries collected by the US Department of
   Agriculture, Vanek (1974) concluded that housework time had not declined
   over the previous half-century-despite the diffusion of many
   "time-saving" home technologies. Although frequently challenged, this
   claim still survives in parts of the sociological literature; we use
   newly available evidence to refute it. Analysis of the original USDA
   diaries (many of which have now been recovered from the US National
   Archives), alongside more recent diary microdata from the American
   Heritage Time Use Study, reveals a pair of clear and contrary trends: a
   continuing decline in women's core housework (cooking and cleaning),
   partially offset by an increase of time in childcare and shopping. Names
   and addresses attached to the original diaries allow the identification
   of more than 93 percent of the USDA diarists in one or both of the 1920
   and 1930 US Federal Censuses. Analysis (Oaxaca decomposition) of the
   household-and individual-level information from this source shows that
   most of the historical time shifts result not from changes in family
   demography or women's growing attachment to paid work over this period
   but from "behavioral" change, reflecting in part the spread of
   labor-saving domestic technology.

AB Conventional economic wisdom maintains that liberalization is partially
   responsible for the recent expansion of income inequality in advanced
   industrial societies. Yet the empirical evidence is far from conclusive,
   as some scholars find a robust positive association between
   liberalization and inequality, while others uncover a significant
   negative association between these variables. This study attempts to
   engage with this burgeoning field of research in order to clarify the
   empirical link between liberalization, economic growth, and income
   inequality. To achieve this objective, the current study compiles a
   panel data set of twenty-one developed economies during the years 1970
   to 2009. According to the findings, liberalization returns a consistent
   positive connection with the pretransfer Gini coefficient using a range
   of regression parameters and robustness checks. Furthermore, although
   there is some support for the contention that liberalization indirectly
   decreases inequality by expanding economic growth, these results are far
   from conclusive as the findings are inconsistent across different
   equations. In conclusion, the results largely support conventional
   wisdom as economic liberalization is found to be a positive predictor of
   income inequality in advanced industrial societies.

AB The importance of childhood circumstances, broadly defined, for shaping
   adult health and longevity is well established. But the significance of
   one of the most prevalent childhood adversities-exposure to problem
   drinkers-has been understudied from a sociological perspective and
   remains poorly understood. We address this gap by drawing on cumulative
   inequality theory, using data from the 1988-2011 National Health
   Interview Survey-Linked Mortality Files, and estimating Cox proportional
   hazards models to examine the relationship between exposure to problem
   drinkers in childhood and adult mortality risk. Childhood exposure to
   problem drinkers is common (nearly one in five individuals were exposed)
   and elevates adult overall and cause-specific mortality risk. Compared
   to individuals who had not lived with a problem drinker during
   childhood, those who had done so suffered 17 percent higher risk of
   death (p < .001) over the follow-up period, net of age, sex, and
   race/ethnicity. We find compelling evidence that the duration, source,
   and intensity of exposure to problem drinkers in childhood contributes
   to inequality in adult mortality risk. Favorable socioeconomic status in
   adulthood does not ameliorate the consequences of childhood exposure to
   problem drinkers. The primary intervening mechanisms are risky
   behaviors, including adult drinking and smoking. The findings-which
   reveal that the influence of problem drinking is far reaching and long
   term-should inform policies to improve childhood circumstances, reduce
   detrimental effects of problem drinking, and increase life expectancy.

AB We present the first nationally representative evidence on the
   relationship between religion and subjective well-being for the case of
   China. Research on Western societies tends to find a positive
   association between being religious and level of well-being. China
   provides an interesting critical case as the religious population is
   growing rapidly and the religious and socioeconomic environments are
   profoundly different from Western societies, implying different
   mechanisms might be at work. We hypothesize to find a positive
   association between religion and well-being in China too, but argue
   social capital, for which strong evidence is often found in Western
   societies, is unlikely to be an important mechanism because religion in
   China is generally non-congregational. Instead, we argue that the
   private and subjective dimension of religion matters for well-being in
   China by helping adherents have an improved sense of social status
   relative to the non-religious in the context of rapid social change and
   growing inequality. Our results generally support these predictions.

AB In this article a new theoretical framework is applied to a research
   field that is somewhat fragmented, namely that of intergenerational
   solidarity in ageing welfare states. Inspired by utilitarian
   considerations many scholars tend to problematize the lack of
   reciprocity characterizing intergenerational exchanges. As some
   generations are longer old and more numerous they may receive excessive
   state-administered support of the younger generations, especially in a
   democratic setting. However, in reality there is limited empirical
   evidence of intergenerational conflict and theoretical explanations of
   this paradox are rare. An integrated and dynamical approach that
   incorporates Durkheim's solidarity theory, Honneth's intersubjective
   recognition theory, and the current work on reciprocal exchange is
   necessary in order to understand the survival of intergenerational
   solidarity in ageing welfare states. According to this model reciprocal
   recognition leading to the empathization of exchanges is the driving
   force of intergenerational solidarity in a prefigurative and
   democratized culture where the status of the young has risen
   dramatically. Hence, we come to the paradoxical conclusion that attempts
   to preserve intergenerational solidarity by openly denouncing excessive
   transfers and trying to bypass them institutionally sometimes might be
   counterproductive because they may erode their empathic underpinnings.

AB In recent years, there has been a growing argument that the end product
   of secularization may not be a disappearance of all things religious,
   but rather a polarization between a larger secular group in society and
   smaller religiously fervent and active communities. Yet, there has been
   little empirical testing of this theory in contexts of advanced
   secularization. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by studying
   individual belief and religiosity trends over the past four decades in
   Great Britain, searching specifically for evidence of the population
   splitting more and more between religious nones' removed from all forms
   of religion, and actively religious individuals characterized by strong
   beliefs and favourable to the public involvement of religion. Analysing
   descriptive statistics from the 1983-2012 BSAs as well as more detailed
   models from the 1991, 1998 and 2008 BSAs, we find growing differences in
   levels of beliefs and attitudes towards public religion between the
   increasing proportions of unaffiliated and, in recent years and among
   younger cohorts, more stable proportions of religiously committed
   individuals. The remaining religiously committed generally have stronger
   beliefs and more favourable views towards religious leaders influencing
   politics in 2008 compared with 1991, and the unaffiliated, less
   favourable views towards public religion.

   effects of organizational and political-legal arrangements that emerged
   in the 1990s in the FIRE sector (i.e., financial, insurance, and real
   estate) on financial malfeasance. Our historical contextualization
   demonstrates how changes in the political-legal arrangements facilitate
   the emergence of new corporate structures and opportunities for
   financial malfeasance. Our longitudinal quantitative analysis
   demonstrates that US FIRE sector corporations with a more complex
   organizational structure, larger size, lower dividend payment, and
   higher executive compensation are more prone to commit financial
   malfeasance.

AB This paper considers the value of a normative account of the
   relationship between agents and institutions for contemporary efforts to
   explain ever more complex and disorganized forms of social life. The
   character of social institutions, as they relate to practices, agents
   and norms, is explored through an engagement with the common claim that
   family life has been de-institutionalized. The paper argues that a
   normative rather than empirical definition of institutions avoids a
   false distinction between institutions and practices. Drawing on ideas
   of social freedom and creative action from critical theory, the changes
   in family life are explained not as an effect of
   de-institutionalization, but as a shift from an organized to a
   disorganized institutional type. This is understood as a response to
   changes in the wider normative structure, as a norm of individual
   freedom has undermined the legitimacy of the organized patriarchal
   nuclear family, with gender ascribed roles and associated duties.
   Contemporary motherhood is drawn on to illustrate the value of analysing
   the dynamic interactions between institutions, roles and practices for
   capturing both the complexity and the patterned quality of social
   experience.

AB The Student Sex Work Project was set up in 2012 in the United Kingdom
   (UK) to locate students who are involved in the sex industry, to
   discover their motivations and needs, and in doing so provide an
   evidence base to consider the development of policy and practice within
   Higher Education. As part of this initiative, a large survey was
   undertaken comprising students from throughout the UK. Reporting on the
   findings from this survey, the article sheds some light on what
   occupations students take up in the sex industry, what motivates their
   participation and how they experience the work. The study also offers a
   much-needed empirical input to the ongoing academic debates on the
   nature of sex work. The results suggest that there can be little doubt
   of a student presence within the sex industry in the UK. The motivations
   and experiences of student sex workers cover elements of agency and
   choice as well as of force and exploitation and it is suggested that
   student sex work is best understood from a polymorphous framework which
   leaves room for a wide variety of experiences and challenges.

AB This article draws on in-depth interviews with 35 openly gay male
   undergraduates from four universities in England to develop an
   understanding of the changing nature of language related to
   homosexuality. In addition to finding a diminution in the prevalence of
   homophobic language, we demonstrate that participants maintain complex
   and nuanced understandings of phrases that do not use homophobic
   pejoratives, such as that's so gay'. The majority of participants
   rejected the notion that these phrases are inherently homophobic,
   instead arguing that the intent with which they are said and the context
   in which they are used are vital in understanding their meaning and
   effect. We conceptualize an intent-context-effect matrix to understand
   the interdependency of these variables. Highlighting the situated nature
   of this matrix, we also demonstrate the importance of the existence of
   shared norms between those saying and hearing the phrase when
   interpreting such language.

   doctors allocate resources to patients with the highest expected
   returns. We assess both sources of inefficiency, exploiting variation in
   rates of negative imaging tests for pulmonaty embolism. We document
   enormous across-doctor heterogeneity in testing conditional on patient
   population, which explains the negative relationship between physicians'
   testing rates and test yields. Furthermore, doctors do not target
   testing to the highest risk patients, reducing test yields by one-third.
   Our calibration suggests misallocation is more costly than overuse.

   However, public sector salaries are uncorrelated with, quality. A simple

AB Consumers' enrollment decisions in Medicare Part D call be explained by
   Abaluck and Gruber's (2011) model of utility maximization with
   psychological biases or by a neoclassical version of their model that
   precludes such biases. We evaluate these competing hypotheses by
   applying nonparametric tests of utility maximization and model
   validation tests to administrative data. We find that 79 percent of
   enrollment decisions from 2006 to 2010 satisfied basic axioms of
   consumer theory under the assumption of full information. The validation
   tests provide evidence against widespread psychological biases. In
   particular, we find that precluding psychological biases improves the

AB Research on the mechanisms that reproduce social class advantages in the
   United States focuses primarily on formal schooling and pays less
   attention to social class discrimination in labor markets. We conducted
   a resume audit study to examine the effect of social class signals on
   entry into large U.S. law firms. We sent applications from fictitious
   students at selective but non-elite law schools to 316 law firm offices
   in 14 cities, randomly assigning signals of social class background and
   gender to otherwise identical resumes. Higher-class male applicants
   received significantly more callbacks than did higher-class women,
   lower-class women, and lower-class men. A survey experiment and
   interviews with lawyers at large firms suggest that, relative to
   lower-class applicants, higher-class candidates are seen as better fits
   with the elite culture and clientele of large law firms. But, although
   higher-class men receive a corresponding overall boost in evaluations,
   higher-class women do not, because they face a competing, negative
   stereotype that portrays them as less committed to full-time, intensive
   careers. This commitment penalty faced by higher-class women offsets
   class-based advantages these applicants may receive in evaluations.
   Consequently, signals of higher-class origin provide an advantage for
   men but not for women in this elite labor market.

AB Most analyses of sexual orientation and earnings find that gay men face
   a wage gap, whereas lesbian women earn higher wages than similar
   heterosexual women. However, analyses rarely consider bisexual men and
   women as a unique group separate from other sexual minorities. I argue
   that such binary views of sexual orientationtreating sexual minorities
   as a homogenous non-heterosexual grouphave obscured understandings of
   the impact of sexual orientation on labor market outcomes. Specifically,
   I predict that unequal outcomes for gay men and lesbian women are partly
   due to the influence of family arrangements and their effects on
   earnings. In contrast, I argue that bisexual men and women should be the
   most disadvantaged in the labor market, due to particularly
   disadvantaging stereotypes, perceptions of choice to their sexual
   orientation, and prejudicial treatment. Using data from the General
   Social Survey (N = 13,554) and the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 14,714), I show that family arrangements
   explain some of the observed earnings differentials for gay men and
   lesbian women. Bisexual men and women, in contrast, face wage penalties
   that are not explained by human capital differences or occupational
   characteristics. Perceptions of prejudicial treatment partially explain
   the observed wage gaps.

AB Motherhood reduces women's wages. But does the size of this penalty
   differ between more and less advantaged women? To answer this, we use
   unconditional quantile regression models with person-fixed effects, and
   panel data from the 1979 to 2010 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
   (NLSY79). We find that among white women, the most privilegedwomen with
   high skills and high wagesexperience the highest total penalties,
   estimated to include effects mediated through lost experience. Although
   highly skilled, highly paid women have fairly continuous experience,
   their high returns to experience make even the small amounts of time
   some of them take out of employment for childrearing costly. By
   contrast, penalties net of experience, which may represent employer
   discrimination or effects of motherhood on job performance, are not
   distinctive for highly skilled women with high wages.

AB A recurring theme in sociological research is the tradeoff between
   fitting in and standing out. Prior work examining this tension tends to
   take either a structural or a cultural perspective. We fuse these two
   traditions to develop a theory of how structural and cultural
   embeddedness jointly relate to individual attainment within
   organizations. Given that organizational culture is hard to observe, we
   develop a novel approach to assessing individuals' cultural fit with
   their colleagues based on the language expressed in internal e-mail
   communications. Drawing on a unique dataset that includes a corpus of
   10.24 million e-mail messages exchanged over five years among 601
   employees in a high-technology firm, we find that network constraint
   impedes, whereas cultural fit promotes, individual attainment. More
   importantly, we find evidence of a tradeoff between the two forms of
   embeddedness: cultural fit benefits individuals with low network
   constraint (i.e., brokers), whereas network constraint promotes
   attainment for people with low cultural fit.

AB The negative outcomes associated with cultural stereotypes based on
   race, class, and gender and related schema-consistency biases are well
   documented. How these biases become culturally entrenched is less well
   understood. In particular, previous research has neglected the role of
   information transmission processes in perpetuating cultural biases. In
   this study, I combine insights from the cultural cognition, affect
   control theory, and cultural transmission frameworks to examine how one
   form of internalized culturefundamental cultural sentimentsaffects the
   content of information shared in communication. I argue that individuals
   communicate narratives in ways that minimize deflection of internalized
   cultural sentiments, resulting in cultural-consistency bias. I test this
   proposition using a serial transmission study in which participants read
   and retell short stories. Results show that culturally inconsistent,
   high-deflection information experiences an initial boost in
   memorability, but consistency biases ultimately win out as information
   is altered to increase cultural consistency, demonstrating that
   deflection provides a promising measure of cultural schema-consistency.
   This measure is predictive of the information that individuals share in
   communication and changes to this information in the transmission
   process.

AB In an era of public-private partnerships, what role do nonprofit
   community-based organizations (CBOs) play in urban governance? Drawing
   on ethnographic fieldwork in Boston, this article presents a new way to
   understand CBOs' political role in poor neighborhoods: CBOs as
   nonelected neighborhood representatives. Over the course of four years,
   I followed nine CBOs in six Boston neighborhoods as they planned
   community development projects. The CBOs in my study superseded elected
   politicians as the legitimate representatives of poor urban
   neighborhoods. Private funders and government agencies legitimated CBO
   leaders' claims and treated them as the preferred representatives of
   neighborhoods' interests. Elected district representatives, by contrast,
   exhibited limited influence over resources and were rarely involved in
   community development decision-making. By reconsidering CBOs' political
   role in urban neighborhoods, this study uncovers a consequential
   realignment of urban political representation. It also identifies an
   important tradeoff between the urban poor's access to resources and the
   ability to hold their leaders democratically accountablea tradeoff that
   will remain so long as governments continue to rely on private actors in
   public governance.

   neighborhood characteristics from initial household formation into
   mid-to-late adulthood. Multilevel growth curve models reveal both
   different starting points and different life course trajectories for
   blacks and whites in neighborhood economic status and neighborhood
   racial composition. Among respondents who first established an
   independent household during the 1970s, improvement in neighborhood
   income over the adult life course was substantially greater for white
   than for black respondents; the racial difference in the percentage of
   neighbors who were non-Hispanic white narrowed slightly with age. Racial
   differences in the characteristics of neighborhoods inhabited during
   adolescence help explain racial differences in starting points and, to a
   lesser extent, subsequent trajectories of neighborhood attainment.
   Residing in an economically advantaged neighborhood during adolescence
   confers greater subsequent benefits in neighborhood economic status for
   white than for black respondents. We use these findings to begin
   developing a life course perspective on neighborhood attainment.

   volatility in leading models of the labor market than that observed in
   the data, irrespective of the level of the opportunity cost.

AB By exploiting a reform in the United Arab Emirates that relaxed
   restrictions on employer transitions, we provide new estimates of the
   monopsony power of firms over migrant workers. Our results show that the
   reform increased incumbent migrants' earnings and firm retention. This
   occurs despite an increase in employer transitions and is driven by a
   fall in country exits. While the outcomes of incumbents improved, the
   reform decreased demand for new migrants and lowered their earnings.
   These results are consistent with a model of monopsony in which firms
   face upward-sloping labor supply curves for both new recruits in source
   countries and incumbent migrants.

   examine why. We find that referrals contain positive information about
   worker performance and persistence that is not contained in workers'
   observable characteristics. We also find that referrals perform
   particularly well when working directly with their referrers. However,
   we do not find evidence that referrals exert more effort because they

AB Recent articles conclude that foreign aid, like other nontax resources,
   inhibits political change in authoritarian regimes. This article
   challenges both the negative political effects of aid and the similarity
   of aid to other resources. It develops a model incorporating changing
   donor preferences and the heterogeneity of foreign aid. Consistent with
   the model's predictions, an empirical test for the period 1973-2010
   shows that, on average, the negative relationship between aid and the
   likelihood of democratic change is confined to the ColdWar period.
   However, in the post-Cold War period, nondemocratic recipients of
   particular strategic importance can still use aid to thwart change. The
   relationship between oil revenue and democratic change does not follow
   the same pattern over time or across recipients. This supports the
   conclusion that aid has different properties than other, fungible,
   resources.

AB While traditionally considered for non-stationary and cointegrated data,
   DeBoef and Keele suggest applying a General Error Correction Model
   (GECM) to stationary data with or without cointegration. The GECM has
   since become extremely popular in political science but practitioners
   have confused essential points. For one, the model is treated as
   perfectly flexible when, in fact, the opposite is true. Time series of
   various orders of integration-stationary, non-stationary, explosive,
   near-and fractionally integrated-should not be analyzed together but
   researchers consistently make this mistake. That is, without equation
   balance the model is misspecified and hypothesis tests and
   long-run-multipliers are unreliable. Another problem is that the error
   correction term's sampling distribution moves dramatically depending
   upon the order of integration, sample size, number of covariates, and
   the boundedness of Y-t. This means that practitioners are likely to
   overstate evidence of error correction, especially when using a
   traditional t-test. We evaluate common GECM practices with six types of
   data, 746 simulations, and five paper replications.

   doctors allocate resources to patients with the highest expected
   returns. We assess both sources of inefficiency, exploiting variation in
   rates of negative imaging tests for pulmonary embolism. We document
   enormous across-doctor heterogeneity in testing conditional on patient
   population, which explains the negative relationship between physicians'
   testing rates and test yields. Furthermore, doctors do not target
   testing to the highest risk patients, reducing test yields by one-third.
   Our calibration suggests misallocation is more costly than overuse.

AB In this article, we highlight three points. First, we counter Grant and
   Lebo's claim that the error correction model (ECM) cannot be applied to
   stationary data. We maintain that when data are properly stationary, the
   ECM is an entirely appropriate model. We clarify that for a model to be
   properly stationary, it must be balanced. Second, we contend that while
   fractional integration techniques can be useful, they also have
   important weaknesses, especially when applied to many time series
   typical in political science. We also highlight two related but often
   ignored complications in time series: low power and overfitting. We
   argue that the statistical tests used in time-series analyses have
   little power to detect differences in many of the sample sizes typical
   in political science. Moreover, given the small sample sizes, many
   analysts overfit their time-series models. Overfitting occurs when a
   statical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying
   relationship. We argue that the results in the Grant and Lebo
   replications could easily be a function of overfitting.

   But Keele, Linn, and Webb also present evidence that ARFIMA models yield
   misleading indicators of the presence and degree of fractional

   simulation study, I find evidence that the simple autodistributed lag

   political methodology meetings in Washington University-St. Louis and
   Florida State University. Their articles, along with comments by Neal
   Beck and John T. Williams, were published in a symposium like this one
   in the fourth volume of Political Analysis. Keele, Lin, and Webb (2016;
   hereafter KLW) and Grant and Lebo (2016; hereafter GL) show how, in the
   years that followed, cointegration was further evaluated by political
   scientists, and the related idea of error correction subsequently was
   applied.
   Have the last twenty-plus years witnessed significant progress in
   modeling nonstationary political time series? In some respects, the
   answer is yes. The present symposium represents progress in
   understanding equation balance, analyzing bounded variables, and
   decomposing short-and long-term causal effects. In these respects KLW's
   and GL's articles deserve wide dissemination. But KLW and GL leave
   important methodological issues unresolved. They do not address some
   critical methodological challenges. From a historical perspective, the
   present symposium shows that we have made relatively little progress in
   modeling nonstationary political time series.

   positive about the prospects of fractionally differencing such data,
   Keele, Linn, and Webb argue that estimates of fractional integration
   will be highly uncertain in short time series. In this study, I simulate
   fractionally integrated data and compare estimates from the general
   error correction model (GECM), which disregards fractional integration,
   to models using fractional integration methods over thirty-two
   simulation conditions. I find that estimates of short-run effects are
   similar across the two models, but that models using fractionally
   differenced data produce superior predictions of long-run effects for
   all sample sizes when there are no short-run dynamics included. When
   short-run dynamics are included, the GECM outperforms the alternative
   model, but only in time series that consist of under 250 observations.

   that the exchange has produced little significant progress because of
   the contributors' failures to consider a wide array of topics not
   directly related to the GECM or FIM. We are less pessimistic. In what
   follows, we distill what we believe are the most important elements of
   the exchange-the importance of balance, the costs and benefits of FIM,
   and the vagaries of pre-testing.

AB Much of the data used in social science is aggregated into spatial
   units, even if the analysis itself does not explicitly incorporate that
   information. A key concern with such aggregation, however, is that
   changes in the units of aggregation themselves cause difficulty in
   comparing data gathered on the old boundaries and the new boundaries.
   Such changes present serious concerns to researchers who may exclude
   observations or cases due to a lack of comparable units or omit certain
   key variables. While geographers have long examined this problem and
   created methods of projecting data from one spatial unit into another,
   known as areal interpolation,(1) it is telling that a recent article
   notes the difficulty for researchers in implementing even the most basic
   solutions without relying heavily on programming skills or proprietary
   software.(2)
   This note makes three contributions toward resolving this problem;
   first, its accompanying R program allows researchers to easily implement
   two simple-but flexible-methods of areal interpolation in any context
   for which the relevant spatial representations (shapefiles) exist.
   Second, it applies these methods to a specific set of variables that are
   widely used in political science (electoral results) and confirms that
   the methods produce generally accurate results using real data gathered
   from six heterogeneous countries (Australia, Canada, Great Britain,
   Germany, New Zealand, and the United States). Third, it runs Monte Carlo
   simulations to examine the performance of the methods given violations
   of the assumptions about the underlying distribution of the variables of
   interest.

AB Although there is a deep and wide consensus that international conflict
   over territory is especially common and destructive, there is less
   agreement over what it is about territory that leads to these outcomes.
   Understanding the role of territory in international conflict requires
   complementing realist and materialist understandings of the value of
   territory with one grounded in the constructivist theories that dominate
   studies of nationalism and geography. Doing so recognizes that homeland
   territoriality, because it raises the value of a specific territory and
   provides an imperative to establish sovereignty over it, plays a
   distinctive role in driving international conflict. This article
   presents a systematic, replicable operationalization of the homeland
   status of territory that, because it is consistent with constructivist
   theories of nationalism, can be used to integrate constructivist
   understandings of the role of territory into quantitative studies of
   territorial conflict. This measure is then used to test the implication
   that the loss of subjectively defined homeland territory increases the
   likelihood of international conflict relative to the loss of nonhomeland
   territory. The findings that dividing homelands is especially likely to
   lead to conflict are corroborated by a second novel measure of the
   homeland status of territory that is based on the identification of
   co-ethnics in a territory before the border was drawn.

AB In response to corruption and inefficient state institutions in
   recipient countries, some foreign aid donors outsource the delivery of
   aid to nonstate development actors. Other donor governments continue to
   support state management of aid, seeking to strengthen recipient states.
   These cross-donor differences can be attributed in large measure to
   different national orientations about the appropriate role of the state
   in public service delivery. Countries that place a high premium on
   market efficiency (for example, the United States, United Kingdom,
   Sweden) will outsource aid delivery in poorly governed recipient
   countries to improve the likelihood that aid reaches the intended
   beneficiaries of services. In contrast, states whose political economies
   emphasize a strong state in service provision (for example, France,

AB States pursue their cooperative and competitive goals using both public
   and private policy tools. Yet there is a profound mismatch between the
   depth, variety, and importance of covert activity and what scholars of
   International Relations (IR) know about it. This article addresses this
   gap by analyzing how adversaries struggle for influence within the
   covert sphere, why they often retreat to it, and when they abandon it.
   It focuses on secrecy among adversaries intervening in local conflicts
   and develops a theory about secrecy's utility as a device for creating
   sustainable limits in war. Drawing on insights about secrecy and
   face-work from the sociologist Erving Goffman, I show that major powers
   individually and collectively conceal evidence of foreign involvement
   when the danger of unintended conflict escalation is acute. Doing so
   creates a kind of "backstage" in which adversaries can exceed limits on
   war without stimulating hard-to-resist pressure to escalate further. An
   important payoff of the theory is making sense of puzzling cases of
   forbearance: even though adversaries often know about their opponent's
   covert activity, they often abstain from publicizing it. Such "tacit
   collusion" arises when both sides seek to manage escalation risks even
   as they compete for power and refuse to capitulate. The article
   evaluates the theory via several nested cases of external intervention
   in the Korean War. Drawing on newly available materials documenting the
   covert air war between secretly deployed Soviet pilots and Western
   forces, the cases show how adversaries can successfully limit war by
   concealing activity from outside audiences. Beyond highlighting the
   promise in studying the covert realm in world politics, the article has
   important implications for scholarship on coercive bargaining,
   reputation, state uses of secrecy, and how regime type influences
   conflict behavior.

AB Violent nonstate groups are usually weaker than the states they target.
   Theory suggests that groups carefully condition their choice of tactics
   on anticipated state response. Yet scholars know very little about
   whether and how groups strategically plan attacks in anticipation of
   state response. Scholars do not know if and under what conditions groups
   employ violent tactics to provoke or avoid a forceful state response,
   although extant theory is consistent with both possibilities. Relatedly,
   there is little systematic evidence about why groups choose terrorist or
   guerrilla tactics and how this choice relates to anticipated state
   response. I develop a theoretical and empirical model of the interaction
   between groups and states that generates unique evidence on all three
   fronts. Using data on attacks in Western Europe from 1950 to 2004, I
   show that guerrilla attacks are sometimes associated with provoking
   forceful state response, whereas terrorist attacks are generally
   associated with avoiding forceful response. Groups effectively choose
   their tactics to avoid forceful state responses that are too damaging
   for themselves but provoke forceful responses that disproportionately
   harm civilians. These findings survive several robustness and model
   specification tests.

AB Britain's 1931 suspension of the gold standard remains one of the most
   shocking policy shifts of the past century. Conventional explanations
   focus on changing international conditions alongside the rise of social
   democracy: when Britons refused to shoulder the increasing costs of
   defending the exchange rate, the Bank of England was "forced" to abandon
   the gold standard. This article refocuses attention on policy-makers'
   causal ideas at critical moments. Drawing on numerous primary sources
   held in several archives, it reveals a cleavage within the Bank over the
   appropriate response to the flight from sterling. Following the nervous
   collapse of the Bank's governor, the deputy governor shifted the Bank's
   strategy from making defensive rate hikes to pursuing fiscal austerity.
   He then "temporarily" suspended gold convertibility in a gambit to
   forestall the election he (incorrectly) assumed would unseat the gold
   standard's supporters in Parliament. When the unintended experiment with
   a managed float proved successful, Keynes was able to persuade
   policy-makers to embrace the new exchange rate regime.

AB Conditions on aid agreements aim to increase aid effectiveness, and are,
   therefore, an important component of aid agreements. Yet little is known
   about why aid-recipient governments comply with these conditions. Some
   scholars have suggested a strategic-importance hypothesis: recipients
   comply when donors enforce conditions and donors enforce conditions when
   recipients are not strategically important. However, there are many
   cases where strategically important countries comply with conditions and
   strategically unimportant countries fail to do so. We argue that to
   explain compliance, we must also understand how the desire to maximize
   revenue from major income sources, such as FDI and natural resource
   rents, changes the recipient's incentive to comply. Using data on World
   Bank records of compliance from 1964 to 2010, we find strong support for
   our hypotheses even after accounting for different model specifications
   and potential endogeneity. Paradoxically, donors can secure compliance
   from recipients for reasons unrelated to the promise of additional aid.

AB This study estimates long-run impacts of a child health investment,
   exploiting community-wide experimental variation in school-based
   deworming. The program increased labor supply among men and education
   among women, with accompanying shifts in labor market specialization.
   Ten years after deworming treatment, men who were eligible as boys stay
   enrolled for more years of primary school, work 17% more hours each
   week, spend more time in nonagricultural self-employment, are more
   likely to hold manufacturing jobs, and miss one fewer meal per week.
   Women who were in treatment schools as girls are approximately one
   quarter more likely to have attended secondary school, halving the
   gender gap. They reallocate time from traditional agriculture into cash
   crops and nonagricultural self-employment. We estimate a conservative
   annualized financial internal rate of return to deworming of 32%, and
   show that mass deworming may generate more in future government revenue
   than it costs in subsidies.

AB Numerous studies have documented a high propensity for self-employment
   and business formation among return migrants relative to non-migrants.
   The literature points to the importance of remitted savings, migration
   duration, and number and types of jobs abroad for business formation
   upon return. Implicit in this scholarship is the assumption that
   migrants acquire not only financial capital, but also human capital,
   which expands their opportunities upon return. Empirical work has
   demonstrated how the transfer of formal human capital, such as language
   skills and professional credentials, influences the mobility pathways of
   professional return migrants. More recent research has also found that
   the transfer of informal human capital, such as social and technical
   skills learned on the job, shape the mobility pathways of return
   migrants with little schooling. Absent from this scholarship, however,
   are studies that directly test the relationship between the transfer of
   informal human capital and the odds of business formation among return
   migrants. In this article, we address this gap. Using a multidimensional
   skills variable, which includes social, technical, and English language
   competences, we measure and test the relationship between skill
   acquisition and transfer and business formation among return migrants.
   Drawing on findings from a survey of 200 return migrants and 200
   non-migrants in Mexico, we show that return migrants who successfully
   acquire and transfer new skills across the migratory circuit often
   leverage their new knowledge to launch businesses. Our findings have
   wide implications for how social scientists conceptualize and measure
   human capital formation across the migratory circuit.

   precommit to a signal to influence the uninformed contestant's belief

   signal when the informed contestant's valuation follows a binary
   distribution, it is without loss of generality to compare no disclosure

AB The recent proliferation of studies examining cross-national variation
   in the association between parenthood and happiness reveal accumulating
   evidence of lower levels of happiness among parents than nonparents in
   most advanced industrialized societies. Conceptualizing parenting as a
   stressor buffered by institutional support, the authors hypothesize that
   parental status differences in happiness are smaller in countries
   providing more resources and support to families. Analyses of the
   European Social Surveys and International Social Survey Programme reveal
   considerable variation in the parenthood gap in happiness across
   countries, with the United States showing the largest disadvantage of
   parenthood. The authors found that more generous family policies,
   particularly paid time off and child-care subsidies, are associated with
   smaller disparities in happiness between parents and nonparents.
   Moreover, the policies that augment parental happiness do not reduce the
   happiness of nonparents. These results shed light on macrolevel causes
   of emotional processes, with important implications for public policy.

AB Corporate governance describes practices that allocate power and control
   within public corporations, especially between shareholders, the board
   of directors, and managers. Shareholder value norms have replaced
   earlier managerialist governance models. Concurrently, cohesion among
   the managerial corporate elite has declined, further contributing to a
   declining managerialist governance consensus. This study considers how
   governance orientations in publicly held corporations are nested within
   interfirm networks. Drawing on prior theory, the author argues that
   cohesive substructures among the corporate elite help account for the
   surprising resilience of managerial control. He finds that more cohesive
   subgroups in the board interlock network have greater managerial control
   and shows how cohesive substructures emerge out of local actor-driven
   mechanisms: (1) directors affiliated with managerialist firms select
   into dense groups, (2) firms appoint directors from similarly governed
   firms, and (3) interlocks help spread governance orientations. These
   findings have implications for theory and research on collective action
   in corporate governance.

AB U.S. corporations have shared members of their boards of directors since
   the early 1900s, creating a dense interlock network in which nearly
   every major corporation was connected through short paths and elevating
   a handful of well-connected directors to an influential inner circle.
   This network remained highly connected throughout the 20th century,
   serving as a mechanism for the rapid diffusion of information and
   practices and promoting elite cohesion. Some of the most
   well-established findings in the sociology of networks sprang from this
   milieu. In the 2000s, however, board recruiting practices changed: the
   authors find that well-connected directors became less preferred. As a
   result, the inner circle disappeared and companies became less connected
   to each other. Revisiting three classic studies, on the diffusion of
   corporate policies, on corporate executives' political unity, and on
   elite socialization, shows that established understandings of the
   effects of board interlocks on U.S. corporations, directors, and social
   elites no longer hold.

AB The economic effects of social structure are dependent on culture and
   must be understood in their cultural context. The authors demonstrate
   this with an analysis of the Liverpool slave trade. They show that as
   abolitionism became more salient in British culture, connections in a
   coinvestment network to both slavers and nonslavers mattered much more
   for predicting entry into the slave trade. As abolitionism rose,
   nonslavers in that public network gained relatively more influence than
   slavers, but the reverse was true in the private network of an elite
   social club. Furthermore, the status of a potential slaver mattered much
   more during the abolition era, as the emergent clarity of norms against
   slaving constrained high-status traders less than middle-status traders.
   The authors present advice to network and status theorists as to how
   they can reflect cultural contingency even in studies conducted in
   stable cultural contexts, thereby creating a more integrated and robust
   economic sociology.

AB In the global legal services market, China has some of the youngest law
   firms but also some of the largest. In the early 21st century, several
   Chinese law firms have grown into mega law firms, with thousands of
   lawyers in a large number of domestic and overseas offices. This study
   uses the case of Chinese law firms to develop an ecological theory of
   organizational growth following the Chicago school of sociology. The
   authors argue that firms coexist and interact in an ecology consisting
   of other firms in the same industry. These firms occupy different
   ecological positions and generate various processes of interaction with
   one another. In their organizational growth, four species of Chinese law
   firms (global generalists, elite boutiques, local coalitions, and space
   rentals) have engaged in a variety of ecological processes, including
   competition, symbiosis, accommodation, assimilation, purification, and
   proletarianization. By locating firms in a social space and
   investigating the spatial and processual patterns of their growth, this
   ecological theory presents not only a system of social classification
   but also a logic of temporal change through social interaction.

AB We develop a new index of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) based on
   newspaper coverage frequency. Several types of evidence-including human
   readings of 12,000 newspaper articles-indicate that our index proxies
   for movements in policy-related economic uncertainty. Our U.S. index
   spikes near tight presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the 9/11
   attacks, the failure of Lehman Brothers, the 2011 debt ceiling dispute,
   and other major battles over fiscal policy. Using firm-level data, we
   find that policy uncertainty is associated with greater stock price
   volatility and reduced investment and employment in policy-sensitive
   sectors like defense, health care, finance, and infrastructure
   construction. At the macro level, innovations in policy uncertainty
   foreshadow declines in investment, output, and employment in the United
   States and, in a panel vector autoregressive setting, for 12 major
   economies. Extending our U.S. index back to 1900, EPU rose dramatically
   in the 1930s (from late 1931) and has drifted upward since the 1960s.

AB We advance marine sociology to analyze the human dimensions of ocean
   systems. Human societies are fundamentally linked to marine systems and
   are transforming oceanic conditions in dramatic ways, resulting in
   socio-ecological problems. Despite the great and important possibilities
   in this realm, these relationships are seldom studied within sociology.
   This article highlights the ecological foundations of human societies,
   emphasizing interactions with marine systems, and presents marine
   sociology as a valuable expansion of environmental sociological studies.
   This approach seeks to better integrate sociological and ecological
   sciences. We propose that social metabolic analysis serves as one useful
   theoretical framework for examining the socio-ecological
   interrelationships. The analysis focuses on the dynamics of ocean
   systems, social processes that are changing marine ecosystems, and the
   perennial interactions within and between these systems. We provide
   brief analyses of climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution,
   revealing how the modern socioeconomic order has created ecological
   rifts in marine ecosystems, and how these concerns reciprocally affect
   social life.

AB Do authoritarian states deter dissent in the diaspora? Using data on
   Libyan and Syrian activism in the United States and Great Britain, this
   study demonstrates that they do through violence, exile, threats,
   surveillance, and by harming dissidents' relatives at home. The analysis
   finds that the transnational repression of these diasporas deterred
   public anti-regime mobilization before the Arab Spring. I then identify
   the mechanisms by which Libyans and Syrians overcame these effects
   during the 2011 revolutions. Activists "came out" when (1) violence at
   home changed their relatives' circumstances and upset repression's
   relational effects; (2) the sacrifices of vanguard activists expanded
   their objects of obligation, leading them to embrace cost sharing; and
   (3) the regimes were perceived as incapable of making good on their
   threats. However, differences in the regimes' perceived capacities to
   repress in 2011 produced significant variation in the pace of diaspora
   emergence over time and guarded advocacy. The study advances
   understanding of transnationalism by demonstrating how states exercise
   coercive power across borders and the conditions under which diasporas
   mobilize to publicly and collectively challenge home-country regimes.

AB One of the major issues attracting the attention of scholars studying
   global norm regimes, especially the human rights regime, is their impact
   on domestic settings. Borrowing from organizational studies, some of
   these scholars have used the term decoupling to conceptualize the
   widespread phenomenon of states that sign conventions but do not
   implement these conventions' norms. In this article, we introduce the
   concept of differentiated decoupling, arguing that the implementation of
   human rights norms needs to be rethought and reoperationalized. We
   present a case study-the right to vote in the United States-to
   illustrate our argument that it is vital to disaggregate the decoupling
   processes and examine the different social groups within the state
   rather than limit scrutiny to the state level. We further contend that
   in order to explain differentiated decoupling, perspectives developed
   and used by sociologists who study inequality need to be adopted. In
   this way, scholars can capture the unequal distribution of human rights
   in domestic settings and begin to untangle the forces leading to
   differentiated decoupling. An analysis of differentiated decoupling
   helps reveal that "more human rights" sometimes means more human rights
   to one group and less to another, suggesting that implementation of
   human rights norms may even deepen stratification.

AB Scholarship at the intersection of social movement and organizational
   theories has illuminated intra-organizational factors that shape
   agencies' efforts to implement policies social movements have fought
   for, emphasizing the roles of agency leaders' ideological commitments to
   movement policy, organizational capacity, and sanctions to ensure
   compliance. I argue that social movement policy implementation is also
   shaped by bureaucrats' tacit understandings of key movement concepts,
   albeit conditioned by how able they feel to implement those
   interpretations in light of political contexts. I make this argument
   through the case of government agency environmental justice (EJ) grant
   programs, analyzing program documents, funding patterns, and
   confidential interviews with agency representatives to explain why most
   EJ grant programs deviate from longstanding EJ movement priorities while
   one program coheres with them. I show that these outcomes stem from the
   fact that many staff-even while avowing support for EJ policy-hold tacit
   understandings of key movement concepts that differ from those of
   advocates. Social movement policy implementation can align with movement
   principles when institutional logics consistent with the movement are
   held, promoted, and defended by agency representatives who feel that
   their institutional environment permits them to implement those ideas.

AB Research on misconduct in science has largely focused on egregious
   violations such as fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism. Recent
   scholarship, however, calls for greater attention to forms of everyday
   misconduct and how scientists navigate ethical ambiguity when they are
   unable or unwilling to make formal accusations. Drawing on interview
   data from 251 physicists and biologists from both elite and non-elite
   universities and research institutes in the United States, United
   Kingdom, and India, we find that scientists are often reticent or unable
   to take formal action against many behaviors they perceive as unethical
   and irresponsible. As a result, they resort to informal gossip to warn
   colleagues of transgressors. Many express confidence that such
   pro-social gossip can serve as a means of social control by tarnishing
   the reputations of transgressors. Yet its effectiveness as a form of
   social control is limited, particularly when transgressors enjoy higher
   status than gossipers. We identify two types and three consequences of
   such gossip and assess the effectiveness of gossip as a means of social
   control. Finally, we consider the implications of our study for
   understanding and decreasing misconduct in science.

AB The goal of this study was to determine the risk of homicide
   victimization associated with an underlying pattern of hazardous
   drinking. Data were from the Izhevsk Family Study (IFS), a large-scale,
   population-based case-control study. There were two sets of cases: all
   men aged 25 to 54 years living in Izhevsk during October 2003 through
   October 2005 who were (1) homicide victims (n = 45) or (2) homicide
   victims or died of injuries of undetermined intent (n = 156). Controls
   were selected at random from a population register. The exposure, an
   ongoing pattern of hazardous alcohol consumption, was variously defined
   as drinking more than 20 liters of ethanol in the prior year,
   consumption of non-beverage alcohols at least once per week, and a set
   of behavioral measures of problematic drinking. Extensive information
   was obtained via interviews with proxy informants living in the same
   household as cases and controls. Each measure of hazardous drinking was
   associated with increased risk of violent death, and nearly 60 percent
   of homicides were attributable to hazardous drinking. Results provide
   strong evidence of an association between an underlying pattern of
   hazardous drinking and vulnerability to violent death.

AB Using ethnographic data from Los Angeles, this article examines how two
   distinctive faith-based programs-Homeboy Industries and Victory
   Outreach-drew upon masculine bodily displays and practices to facilitate
   recovery from gang life. First, recovery's body projects negotiated
   masculine bodily displays from gang member to "family man" or "man of
   God" by reshaping malleable facets of men's embodiment. Second, leaders
   protected reformed gang embodiment from the risk of being interpreted as
   a failed masculinity by emasculating active gang embodiment. Lastly,
   because some subjects had difficulty overcoming rigid facets of
   masculine gang embodiment-such as drug addiction-recovery provided
   bodily practices for reshaping and redirecting rigid facets of
   embodiment. Whereas emerging research on gang exit has built upon
   functionalist-oriented life-course and role-exit perspectives of crime
   desistance, this article suggests that embodied, masculine contests are
   fundamental to the phenomenological realities of gang recovery.
   Recovering gang members deepen commitment to exit from gang life not by
   being passively legitimated as "family men" or "men of God," but by
   actively using bodily displays and practices to construct new, masculine
   moral universes.

   savings and medical spending and use it to compute the distribution of
   lifetime Medicaid transfers and Medicaid valuations across currently
   single retirees. Compensating variation calculations indicate that
   current retirees value Medicaid insurance at more than its actuarial
   cost, but that most would value an expansion of the current Medicaid
   program at less than its cost. These findings suggest that for current

   constraints on patient choice. We estimate a demand model that
   explicitly captures the removal of the choice constraints imposed on
   patients. We find that, post-removal, patients became more responsive to
   clinical quality. This led to a modest reduction in mortality and a
   substantial increase in patient welfare. The elasticity of demand faced
   by hospitals increased substantially post-reform and we find evidence
   that hospitals responded to the enhanced incentives by improving
   quality. This suggests greater choice can raise quality.

   information. This information, however, is unobserved by an analyst, so
   from the latter's perspective, choice is probabilistic or random. We
   provide a theory in which information can be fully identified from
   random choice. In addition, the analyst can perform the following
   inferences even when information is unobservable: (1) directly compute
   ex ante valuations of menus from random choice and vice versa, (2)
   assess which agent has better information by using choice dispersion as
   a measure of informativeness, (3) determine if the agent's beliefs about
   information are dynamically consistent, and (4) test to see if these
   beliefs are well-calibrated or rational.

AB Consider a group of individuals with unobservable perspectives
   (subjective prior beliefs) about a sequence of states. In each period,
   each individual receives private information about the current state and
   forms an opinion (a posterior belief). She also chooses a target
   individual and observes the target's opinion. This choice involves a
   trade-off between well-informed targets, whose signals are precise, and
   well-understood targets, whose perspectives are well known. Opinions are
   informative about the target's perspective, so observed individuals
   become better understood over time. We identify a simple condition under
   which long-run behavior is history independent. When this fails, each
   individual restricts attention to a small set of experts and observes
   the most informed among these. A broad range of observational patterns
   can arise with positive probability, including opinion leadership and
   information segregation. In an application to areas of expertise, we
   show how these mechanisms generate own field bias and large field
   dominance.

AB We analyze the internal consistency of using the market price of a
   firm's equity to trigger a contractual change in the firm's capital
   structure, given that the value of the equity itself depends on the
   firm's capital structure. Of particular interest is the case of
   contingent capital for banks, in the form of debt that converts to
   equity, when conversion is triggered by a decline in the bank's stock
   price. We analyze the problem of existence and uniqueness of equilibrium
   values for a firm's liabilities in this context, meaning values
   consistent with a market-price trigger. Discrete-time dynamics allow
   multiple equilibria. In contrast, we show that the possibility of
   multiple equilibria can largely be ruled out in continuous time, where
   the price of the triggering security adjusts in anticipation of
   breaching the trigger. Our main condition for existence of an
   equilibrium requires that the consequences of triggering a conversion be
   consistent with the direction in which the trigger is crossed. For the
   design of contingent capital with a stock price trigger, this condition
   may be interpreted to mean that conversion should be disadvantageous to
   shareholders, and it is satisfied by setting the trigger sufficiently
   high. Uniqueness follows provided the trigger is sufficiently accessible
   by all candidate equilibria. We illustrate precise formulations of these
   conditions with a variety of applications.

AB We introduce the class of conditional linear combination tests, which
   reject null hypotheses concerning model parameters when a data-dependent
   convex combination of two identification-robust statistics is large.
   These tests control size under weak identification and have a number of
   optimality properties in a conditional problem. We show that the
   conditional likelihood ratio test of Moreira, 2003 is a conditional
   linear combination test in models with one endogenous regressor, and
   that the class of conditional linear combination tests is equivalent to
   a class of quasi-conditional likelihood ratio tests. We suggest using
   minimax regret conditional linear combination tests and propose a
   computationally tractable class of tests that plug in an estimator for a
   nuisance parameter. These plug-in tests perform well in simulation and
   have optimal power in many strongly identified models, thus allowing
   powerful identification-robust inference in a wide range of linear and
   nonlinear models without sacrificing efficiency if identification is
   strong.

AB Confidence intervals are commonly used to describe parameter
   uncertainty. In nonstandard problems, however, their frequentist
   coverage property does not guarantee that they do so in a reasonable
   fashion. For instance, confidence intervals may be empty or extremely
   short with positive probability, even if they are based on inverting
   powerful tests. We apply a betting framework and a notion of
   bet-proofness to formalize the reasonableness of confidence intervals as
   descriptions of parameter uncertainty, and use it for two purposes.
   First, we quantify the violations of bet-proofness for previously
   suggested confidence intervals in nonstandard problems. Second, we
   derive alternative confidence sets that are bet-proof by construction.
   We apply our framework to several nonstandard problems involving weak
   instruments, near unit roots, and moment inequalities. We find that
   previously suggested confidence intervals are not bet-proof, and
   numerically determine alternative bet-proof confidence sets.

AB This paper provides a novel mechanism for identifying and estimating
   latent group structures in panel data using penalized techniques. We
   consider both linear and nonlinear models where the regression
   coefficients are heterogeneous across groups but homogeneous within a
   group and the group membership is unknown. Two approaches are
   consideredpenalized profile likelihood (PPL) estimation for the general
   nonlinear models without endogenous regressors, and penalized GMM (PGMM)
   estimation for linear models with endogeneity. In both cases, we develop
   a new variant of Lasso called classifier-Lasso (C-Lasso) that serves to
   shrink individual coefficients to the unknown group-specific
   coefficients. C-Lasso achieves simultaneous classification and
   consistent estimation in a single step and the classification exhibits
   the desirable property of uniform consistency. For PPL estimation,
   C-Lasso also achieves the oracle property so that group-specific
   parameter estimators are asymptotically equivalent to infeasible
   estimators that use individual group identity information. For PGMM
   estimation, the oracle property of C-Lasso is preserved in some special
   cases. Simulations demonstrate good finite-sample performance of the
   approach in both classification and estimation. Empirical applications
   to both linear and nonlinear models are presented.

AB The past forty years have seen a rapid rise in top income inequality in
   the United States. While there is a large number of existing theories of
   the Pareto tail of the long-run income distributions, almost none of
   these address the fast rise in top inequality observed in the data. We
   show that standard theories, which build on a random growth mechanism,
   generate transition dynamics that are too slow relative to those
   observed in the data. We then suggest two parsimonious deviations from
   the canonical model that can explain such changes: scale dependence that
   may arise from changes in skill prices, and type dependence, that is,
   the presence of some high-growth types. These deviations are consistent
   with theories in which the increase in top income inequality is driven
   by the rise of superstar entrepreneurs or managers.

AB Riders to appropriations bills have long been a favorite congressional
   instrument for forcing presidents to accept unwanted policies. To resist
   unwanted riders, presidents have increasingly resorted to veto threats.
   Are such threats credible, and do they influence legislation? To answer
   these questions, we analyze the legislative histories of hundreds of
   threatened and unthreatened riders from 1985 through 2008. We find that
   threats are effective in bringing the final legislation closer to the
   president's preferences. Threats achieve their success, in large part,
   by interrupting the textbook legislative process in the Senate-spawning
   filibusters, prompting leaders to punt bills to conference, and
   encouraging the use of other "unorthodox" procedures. Unlike
   conventional models that regard veto threats as minimally effective, the
   findings presented here depict veto rhetoric as integral to identifying
   critical riders separating the legislative parties that must be resolved
   in order to avoid gridlock and pass annual appropriations legislation.

   and 1970s and then largely plateaued. The policy liberalism of most
   states has remained stable in relative terms, though several states have
   shifted considerably over time. We also find surprisingly little

   estimates of state policy liberalism have broad application to the study

AB Presidents become increasingly effective at managing the bureaucracy
   because of the information and expertise that they acquire from

   predicts that presidents become better at reducing information
   asymmetries incurred from the bureaucracy (Agent Selection Learning),
   improve the vertical balance of leadership agent traits between top
   supervisory positions and subordinates directly beneath them (Agent
   Monitoring Learning), and place a greater relative premium on loyalty in
   response to horizontal policy conflict between the White House and the
   Senate (Common Agency Learning). This logic obtains empirical support
   from the analysis of bureaucratic agent traits for Senate-confirmed
   presidential appointees serving in leadership positions covering 39 U.S.
   federal government agencies from 1977 to 2009. Presidents' appointment
   strategies reflect their increasing effectiveness at managing the

AB Retrospective voting studies typically examine policies where the public

   opponents mirrors opposition to other policies with diffuse public
   benefits and concentrated local costs. I use a natural experiment to
   investigate whether citizens living in proximity to wind energy projects
   retrospectively punished an incumbent government because of its climate
   policy. Using both fixed effects and instrumental variable estimators, I
   identify electoral losses for the incumbent party ranging from 4 to 10%,
   with the effect persisting 3 km from wind turbines. There is also
   evidence that voters are informed, only punishing the government
   responsible for the policy. I conclude that the spatial distribution of
   citizens' policy preferences can affect democratic accountability
   through 'spatially distorted signalling', which can exacerbate political
   barriers to addressing climate change.

   discounting" is a contributing factor to ideological incongruence. A
   pair of survey experiments where state and local politicians are the
   subjects of interest show that public officials rationalize this
   behavior by assuming that constituents with opposing views are less
   informed about the issue. This finding applies both to well-established
   issues that divide the parties as well as to nonpartisan ones. Further,
   it cannot be explained by politicians' desires to favor the opinions of
   either copartisans or likely voters. A third survey experiment using a
   sample of voters shows that the bias is exacerbated by an activity
   central to representative governance-taking and explaining one's policy
   positions. This suggests that the job of being a representative

   disillusionment should peak in contexts in which women's earnings fall
   closely behind men, and that ideological optimism should rebound in
   contexts in which women's earnings have achieved parity with that of

   empirically supported, pointing toward the electoral rule
   disproportionality as a major determinant of polarization.

AB While most executive nominees are successfully confirmed, this success
   masks wide variation in how long it takes the Senate to decide. Delay of
   critical nominees influences the character and effectiveness of agencies
   while hampering the policy ambitions of presidents. The exact logic of
   which nominees are targeted for delay and why, however, remains
   difficult to uncover. Building on prior literature, this project
   suggests that delay can be used to protect allied agencies from
   presidential politicization. Using a data set of several thousand
   executive nominations from 1987 to 2012, the ideological predisposition
   of an agency relative to the president is demonstrated to influence
   senatorial delay. Ultimately, these findings help explain why some
   nominees are delayed while other, seemingly similar, nominees are not.

AB An influential literature argues that corruption behaves as a
   self-fulfilling prophecy. Its central claim is that the individual
   returns to corruption are a function of the perceived corruptibility of
   the other members of society. Empirically, this implies that if one were
   to exogenously increase beliefs about societal levels of corruption,
   willingness to engage in corruption should also increase. We evaluate
   this implication by utilizing an information experiment embedded in a
   large-scale household survey recently conducted in the Gran Area
   Metropolitana of Costa Rica. Changes in beliefs about corruption were
   induced via the random assignment of an informational display depicting
   the increasing percentage of Costa Ricans who have personally witnessed
   an act of corruption. Consistent with the self-fulfilling prophecy
   hypothesis, we find that internalizing the information from the display
   on average increased the probability that a respondent would be willing
   to bribe a police officer by approximately .05 to .10.

   issues, both practical and conceptual, involved in conducting these

   assumptions and data choices. I show that the standard strategy of
   estimating ideal point models using preference data on citizens and
   elites can suffer from potentially problematic pathologies. This article
   explores these issues and presents a technique that can be used to
   investigate the effects of modeling assumptions on resulting estimates
   and also to impose restrictions on the ideological dimension being

   scores for a larger number of countries and time periods than currently
   exists for any single measure, and in a way that is replicable and easy
   to update. It begins by identifying all of the studies that have

   scholars have attempted to capture when they have operationalized the
   concept of presidential power. It then identifies all the measures of
   presidential power that have been proposed over the years, noting the
   problems associated with each. To generate the new set of presidential
   power scores, the study draws upon the comparative and local knowledge
   embedded in existing measures of presidential power. Employing principal
   component analysis, together with the expectation maximization algorithm
   and maximum likelihood estimation, a set of presidential power scores is
   generated for a larger set of countries and country time periods than
   currently exists, reporting 95 per cent confidence intervals and
   standard errors for the scores. Finally, the implications of the new set
   of scores for future studies of presidential power is discussed.

   expectations of increased risk to agencies following transitions in

   incongruence between the originally establishing and currently
   overseeing political executive. Using survival models for UK executive
   agencies between 1989 and 2012, the study finds that politics trumps
   performance. Ministers seek to make their mark by terminating agencies
   created by previous ministers, which is reinforced by high media
   attention to the agency. Performance against agency targets is not
   associated with higher termination risk, and replacement agencies do not
   perform any better than those that were terminated. Financial autonomy
   provides some protection for agencies that are less dependent on

AB Modern liberal democracies typically depend on courts with the power of
   constitutional review to ensure that elected officials do not breach
   their constitutional obligations. The efficacy of this review, however,
   can depend on the public observing such breaches. One resource available
   to many of the world's constitutional courts to influence the public's
   ability to do so is public oral hearings. Drawing on the comparative
   judicial literature on separation of powers, public awareness, and
   noncompliance, I develop a formal model of public oral hearings. The
   model provides empirical implications for when a court will hold public
   oral hearings and how hearings correspond to a court's willingness to
   rule against elected officials. An empirical analysis of hearings at the
   German Constitutional Court supports the model's prediction that courts
   use hearings as a resource to address potential noncompliance.

AB Scholars, observing clustering in transitions to democracy, argue that
   democratization diffuses across borders as citizens in autocracies
   demand the same reforms they witness in neighboring states. We disagree.
   This article demonstrates that diffusion plays only a highly conditional
   role in democratization. We advance and test an alternative two-step
   theory of clustered democratization: (1) economic and international
   political shocks, which are clustered spatially and temporally, induce
   the breakdown of authoritarian regimes; then (2) democratic diffusion,
   in turn, influences whether a fallen dictatorship will be replaced by a
   democracy or a new autocracy. Diffusion, despite playing an important
   role, is insufficient to explain the clustering of transitions. Using
   data on 125 autocracies from 1875 to 2004, we show that economic crises
   trigger authoritarian breakdowns, while diffusion influences whether the
   new regime is democratic or authoritarian.

AB A broad literature on how oil wealth affects civil war onset argues that
   oil production engenders violent contests to capture a valuable prize
   from vulnerable governments. By contrast, research linking oil wealth to
   durable authoritarian regimes argues that oil-rich governments deter
   societal challenges by strategically allocating enormous revenues to
   enhance military capacity and to provide patronage. This article
   presents a unified formal model that evaluates how these competing
   mechanisms affect overall incentives for center-seeking civil wars. The
   model yields two key implications. First, large oil-generated revenues
   strengthen the government and exert an overall effect that decreases
   center-seeking civil war propensity. Second, oil revenues are less
   effective at preventing center-seeking civil war relative to other
   revenue sources, which distinguishes overall and relative effects.
   Revised statistical results test overall rather than relative effects by
   omitting the conventional but posttreatment covariate of income per
   capita, and demonstrate a consistent negative association between oil
   wealth and center-seeking civil war onset.

AB Financial regulatory networks are a pervasive new type of global
   governance heralded by some as a flexible answer to globalization
   dilemmas and dismissed by others as ineffective because of weak
   enforcement mechanisms. Whether regulatory network agreements provide
   global public goods or private goods for certain states' firms is a
   second debated issue. This article adjudicates among competing
   perspectives by examining whether Basel III, an international agreement
   about bank capital minimums negotiated by the bank regulatory network in
   2009 and 2010, was viewed as credible and affecting regulated US firms.
   I use stock returns to measure investors' perceptions, and an event
   study methodology to test whether regulated banks' observed stock
   returns significantly differ from expected stock returns on days when
   new information about Basel III becomes available. If the agreement is
   viewed as credible and affecting firm value, banks' stock returns will
   deviate from expectations. The direction of any deviation indicates
   whether regulations benefit or hurt banks. Although the direction of
   effects is not uniform across events, I find that the initial stock
   return reaction and the net effect across all five events are negative,
   and of a similar magnitude as regulated foreign banks, indicating that
   US banks were harmed, and did not benefit from, the new international
   regulations. US banks experienced stock returns that differed from
   expectations, providing evidence that international regulatory network
   agreements are viewed as credible and tangibly affect firms independent
   of domestic implementation.

   without GIS are now being completed, and the spatial component of
   international politicslong considered central but rarely incorporated

   challenges, and to apply GIS successfully, two specific issues need to
   be addressed: measurement validity and selection bias. Both relate to
   the challenge of conceptualizing nonspatial phenomena with the spatial
   tools of GIS. Significant measurement error can occur when the concepts
   that are coded as spatial variables are not, in fact, validly measured
   by the default data structure of GIS, and selection bias can arise when
   GIS systematically excludes certain types of units. Because these
   potential problems are hidden by the technical details of the method,
   GIS data sets and analyses can sometimes appear to overcome these
   challenges when, in fact, they fail to do so. Once these issues come to
   light, however, potential solutions become apparentincluding some in

   elementswhen the program will make progress and when the other state
   will discover thisdetermine outcomes. Surprise proliferation, crises
   over the suspected progress of a nuclear program, and possibly mistaken
   preventive wars arise endogenously from these chance elements.
   Consistent with the model's predictions and contrary to previous
   studies, the empirical evidence shows that the progress of a nuclear
   program and intelligence estimates of it explain the character and
   outcomes of most interactions between a proliferant and a potential
   preventive attacker. Counterintuitively, policies intended to reduce

   present evidence that partisan attachments not only serve to filter the

   the other direction, isolating politicians from encountering potentially
   contrary perspectives from citizens. In particular, we hypothesized that
   Americans prefer expressing their opinions to politicians who share
   their party identification and avoid contacting outpartisan politicians.
   Three studies-drawing on a mixture of observational, field experimental,
   and natural experimental approaches-support this hypothesis: Citizens
   prefer to "preach to the choir," contacting legislators of the same
   partisan stripe. In light of evidence that contact from citizens
   powerfully affects politicians' stances and priorities, these findings
   suggest a feedback loop that might aggravate political polarization and
   help explain how politicians of different parties could develop

   preferences reflect their own views and their information that, when
   aggregated via intraparty deliberations, influences the party manifesto.
   By joining a faction, a politician increases the influence of its leader
   on the manifesto, but foregoes his individual bargaining power. For
   broad model specifications, we find that a faction formation process
   allows power to be transferred to moderate politicians. This facilitates
   information sharing, increasing the capacity of the party to attain its
   objective. These positive welfare effects may hold even when
   factionalism restricts intraparty dialogue, and hold a fortiori when
   information is freely exchanged across factions. We conclude that the

AB Postulating grievance-based mechanisms, several recent studies show that
   politically excluded ethnic groups are more likely to experience civil
   conflict. However, critics argue that endogeneity may undermine this
   finding since governments' decisions to include or exclude could be
   motivated by the anticipation of conflict. We counter this threat to
   inference by articulating a causal pathway that explains ethnic groups'
   access to power independently of conflict. Focusing on postcolonial
   states, we exploit differences in colonial empires' strategies of rule
   to model which ethnic groups were represented in government at the time
   of independence. This identification strategy allows estimating the
   exogenous effect of inclusiveness on conflict. We find that previous
   studies have tended to understate the conflict-dampening impact of
   political inclusion. This finding suggests that grievances have been
   prematurely dismissed from conventional explanations of conflict, and
   that policy makers should consider conflict resolution methods based on
   power sharing and group rights.

AB My purpose in this essay is to show that the enduring value of Alexis de
   Tocqueville's work is rooted in his philosophical anthropology, or view
   of human nature. In Democracy in America, Tocqueville reveals his view
   of human nature as he treats the relationship between religion and
   politics in the democratic social state. His political science remains
   valuable because he understands human beings as creatures distinguished
   by their desire for the infinite and immortal. In sum, for Tocqueville,
   religion is an essential support of liberty in the democratic social
   state because it answers the soul's desire for the infinite and
   immortal, and provides the foundations for personal and political
   justice.

AB We study the effect of top tax rates on "superstar" inventors'
   international mobility since 1977, using panel data on inventors from
   the US and European Patent Offices. We exploit the differential impact
   of changes in top tax rates on inventors of different qualities.
   Superstar inventors' location choices are significantly affected by top
   tax rates. In our preferred specification, the elasticity to the
   net-of-tax rate of the number of domestic superstar inventors is around
   0.03, while that of foreign superstar inventors is around 1. These
   elasticities are larger for inventors in multinational companies. An
   inventor is less sensitive to taxes in a country if his company performs
   a higher share of its research there.

AB This article studies the beneficial return from potential work
   experience in preventing job loss, and seeks to explain whether its
   capacity for protection is different for immigrants compared with native
   workers. Logistic regression models are calculated from panel data of
   the Spanish Labour Force Survey between 2008 and 2010. Results indicate
   that for some foreign-born groups, the inequality with respect to
   natives grows over time. Whereas for Spaniards, increased years in the
   labour market reduce the risk of becoming unemployed, Africans, Latin
   Americans, and Eastern Europeans with more time in the labour market
   experience hardly any advantage when compared with their fellow
   immigrants. Although the ethnic penalty is slightly reduced after taking
   into account socio-demographic differences, the lower return is mainly
   explained by employment factors. Foreign-born workers are permanently
   over-represented in low-skilled and non-standard jobs where potential
   work experience does not result in more protection. The access through
   the bottom of a segmented labour market has prevented immigrants
   becoming upwardly mobile to more stable occupations. These positions
   would have provided them with protection against unemployment during the
   economic crisis, in the way that they have done for native workers.

AB Explanations of anti-immigrant attitudes in Europe have been centred
   around the labour market competition and group threat theories. The
   article tests these theories with the data from Russia and finds some
   support for the group threat theory. Attitudes towards several immigrant
   ethnic groups are analysed separately. While Russians generally accept
   Ukrainians and Moldovans as their potential neighbours, they are more
   hostile to immigrants from the Caucasus and Central Asia. This ethnic
   hierarchy is shared by all large ethnic groups populating Russia. The
   analysis of regional-level covariates of anti-immigrant sentiment shows
   that higher concentration of immigrants is associated with more negative
   attitudes towards most immigrant groups, except Ukrainians. Poorer
   regions are more xenophobic. The predictive power of statistical models
   explaining anti-immigrant prejudice is considerably lower in Russia
   compared with Western European countries. The article discusses to what
   extent standard explanations of anti-immigrant attitudes in Europe can
   be applied in Russia.

AB Educational aspirations are generally based on past academic achievement
   and families' endowment with the resources needed to reach targeted
   educational levels. However, although they perform worse at school and
   hold lower social status, previous research observes that some ethnic
   minorities tend to express higher educational ambitions than natives.
   This study discusses and tests possible reasons for this striking
   finding using German data from the Young Immigrants in the German and
   Israeli Educational Systems project, which includes families from Turkey
   and the former Soviet Union. The results reveal that Turkish students
   hold higher aspirations than their native counterparts, whereas no
   aspiration gap was found between natives and adolescents from the former
   Soviet Union. While German students' aspiration patterns can mainly be
   ascribed to status attainment motivation, Turkish students' high
   educational ambitions seem to be stimulated by a desire of status upward
   mobility.

AB This study investigates whether an expansion of state-subsidized
   full-day childcare may improve the subjective well-being of mothers of
   children under school age by acting as a boundary-spanning resource to
   facilitate the combination of employment and childcare responsibilities.
   It extends previous studies that showed contradictory results by
   demonstrating that the relationship with parental subjective well-being
   may vary by local work-care culture and family resources. To this
   effect, we compare mothers in East and West Germany and mothers with and
   without a partner in the household, respectively. The empirical analysis
   links individual-level data from the Socio-Economic Panel for 2007 to
   2012 and from the 'Families in Germany' Study for 2010 to 2012 with
   administrative records on day-care provision at the county level. We
   apply fixed-effects panel models to samples of 3,203 families with a
   youngest child under school age. Our results show that greater provision
   of full-day care is modestly positively associated with satisfaction
   with family life and with life overall among partnered mothers in East
   Germany but not in West Germany. The level of full-day care availability
   in a county and take-up of full-day childcare, however, moderate the
   relationship of maternal transitions to long part-time or full-time
   employment with satisfaction with family life in West Germany. In both
   East and West Germany, switching to full-day care for the youngest child
   is more positively associated with satisfaction with family life for
   lone mothers than for partnered mothers.

AB This study examines the effects of the recent economic crisis, the

   politicization of the EU on four dimensions of EU framing among
   Europeans. Based on a detailed set of items on EU meanings from pooled
   Eurobarometer data from 2004 to 2013, I investigate the evolution of
   cosmopolitan, utilitarian, libertarian, and communitarian EU framing
   across EU countries during the economic crisis. The results show, first,
   that poor economic performances increase negative and decrease positive
   dimensions of EU framing. Secondly, high unemployment rates affect the
   EU framing of high-educated citizens to a larger extent, while gross
   domestic product (GDP) growth impacts mainly on the EU framing of
   low-educated citizens: high unemployment rates are associated with a
   smaller gap between high- and low-educated citizens in the way they
   frame the EU and low GDP growth with a larger gap. Thirdly, benefiting
   from the EU financial stability program increases citizens'
   communitarian EU framing and decreases their cosmopolitan understanding
   of the EU. Lastly, the politicization of the EU is associated with
   higher positive EU framing and lower negative evaluation of the EU among
   citizens.

AB A classical question in political sociology is whether unemployment
   depresses political involvement. However, we still know very little
   about how individual and contextual factors influence the involvement of
   unemployed citizens. We therefore provide a framework to study variation
   across countries as well as among the unemployed. Borrowing mechanisms
   from psychological unemployment research, we develop a set of hypotheses
   about individual and contextual moderators that mitigate or exacerbate
   the negative effect of unemployment on political involvement. Our
   empirical analyses are based on the European Social Survey and use
   internal political efficacy as a dependent variable. Multi-level models
   with interaction effects show that the negative effect of unemployment
   on political efficacy is stronger in countries with low welfare state
   generosity, low levels of economic development, high unemployment rates,
   and large income inequality. On the individual level, the negative
   effect is stronger for men, middle-to-high-income earners, and political
   independents. The effect of age is hump-shaped (stronger negative effect
   for the young and older citizens). An important implication of our
   results is that public policies can foster the political integration of
   vulnerable citizens and therefore make a contribution to the functioning
   of democracy.

AB We analyse how the disadvantages that are associated with parental
   background, as measured using multiple indicators, are related to the
   probability of a child completing secondary school by the age of 22. We
   measure family background by the parents' relative income poverty, the
   social assistance that they received, and their unemployment when their
   children were young. We further study how negative associations between
   such disadvantages and the education of their children are related to
   the educational attainment of the parents themselves. We use
   high-quality register data clustered according to families and include
   information on both children and their parents. The data are analysed
   with sibling methods using random-effect linear probability models. The
   results show that in particular, the long-term social assistance that
   parents received and the cumulative disadvantage are connected to the
   probability that their children will not complete secondary school. The
   experiences of parental poverty combined with social assistance strongly
   indicate that children will not complete secondary school by the age of
   22. However, there is more variation between socio-economically
   disadvantaged families than there is between better-off families, which
   suggests that non-socio-economic factors modify the association between
   parents' disadvantaged background and not completing secondary school.

AB Research on socio-economic mobility focuses on how background affects
   later labour market outcomes. Growing up in a disadvantaged household
   does not always lead to the same outcomes however, and the extent to
   which this matters depends on the local labour market. Using multilevel
   models on the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, this article shows that
   disadvantaged young adults (16-35 years old) are more affected by the
   business cycle than their similarly educated counterparts from more
   advantaged backgrounds. We propose that a disadvantaged background
   lowers desirability on the labour market, which matters more to
   employers as the labour market worsens. When the local labour market is
   slack, disadvantaged young adults get crowded out of good jobs by their
   more advantaged but similarly qualified peers. Among the higher
   qualified, this means the disadvantaged work on lower paying jobs, while
   those who are less educated are most at risk of unemployment. These
   results are robust to using different specifications. As the early
   career has long-term effects, the conditions during which young adults
   enter the labour market can play a large role in their labour market
   outcomes and can affect inequality by background overall.

AB Using Norwegian registry data, I study the intergenerational
   transmission of educational attainment and adult earnings from immigrant
   parents to their second-generation children. Generational progress is
   documented by strongly reduced native-immigrant gaps in completed
   education and relative earnings position among the immigrant offspring
   compared to the gaps found in the parental generation. The level of
   intergenerational gains is highest within the ethnic minority groups
   characterized by the lowest parental statuses. The overall
   child-by-parent gradients in education and earnings are broadly similar
   among immigrants and natives, suggesting comparable rates of upward
   mobility among children of immigrants and children of natives with
   disadvantaged family background. Children of immigrants in several
   non-European ethnic minorities actually achieve higher educational
   attainment and earnings as adults when compared to their native
   counterparts with similar parental socio-economic status and
   neighbourhood of residence in adolescence. The role of neighbourhood
   segregation appears to be considerably less important in accounting for
   the native-immigrant socio-economic attainment gaps than observed
   parental characteristics. The results suggest substantial
   intergenerational convergence in socio-economic life chances between the
   children of immigrants and the children of the native-born in the
   egalitarian Norwegian welfare state setting.

AB Despite the profound impact Durkheim's Suicide has had on the social
   sciences, several enduring issues limit the utility of his insights.
   With this study, we offer a new Durkheimian framework for understanding
   suicide that addresses these problems. We seek to understand how high
   levels of integration and regulation may shape suicide in modern
   societies. We draw on an in-depth, qualitative case study (N = 110) of a
   cohesive community with a serious adolescent suicide problem to
   demonstrate the utility of our approach. Our case study illustrates how
   the lives of adolescents in this highly integrated community are
   intensely regulated by the local culture, which emphasizes academic
   achievement. Additionally, the town's cohesive social networks
   facilitate the spread of information, amplify the visibility of actions
   and attitudes, and increase the potential for swift sanctions. This
   combination of cultural and structural factors generates intense
   emotional reactions to the prospect of failure among adolescents and an
   unwillingness to seek psychological help for adolescents' mental health
   problems among both parents and youth. Ultimately, this case illustrates
   (1) how high levels of integration and regulation within a social group
   can render individuals vulnerable to suicide and (2) how sociological
   research can provide meaningful and unique insights into suicide
   prevention.

   neighborhoods, were far less likely to report crime after Jude's beating
   was broadcast. The effect lasted for over a year and resulted in a total
   net loss of approximately 22,200 calls for service. Other local and

AB What drives local decisions to prohibit industrial land uses? This study
   examines the passage of municipal ordinances prohibiting gas development

   local action against fracking depended on multiple conceptions of the
   shale gas industry. Matching these alternative conceptions with
   prevailing spatial models of public response to industrial land usesnot
   in my backyard, not in anyone's backyard, and please in my
   backyardimproves our understanding of where local contention might
   emerge and how it contributes to policy change. Results from event
   history and logistic regression analyses show, first, that communities
   lying above favorable areas of the shale did not pass anti-fracking laws
   because opposition to fracking was counteracted by significant local
   support for development. Fracking bans passed primarily in a geographic
   sweet spot on the periphery of targeted regions, where little or no
   compelling economic interest in development existed. Second, as fracking
   became the subject of a highly politicized national debate, local
   opposition increasingly reflected mobilization by political liberals.
   This trend is reflected in the increasing rate of ordinance adoption
   among Democratic-leaning communities outside the geographic sweet spot.

AB Despite the relevance of nationalism for politics and intergroup
   relations, sociologists have devoted surprisingly little attention to
   the phenomenon in the United States, and historians and political
   psychologists who do study the United States have limited their focus to
   specific forms of nationalist sentiment: ethnocultural or civic
   nationalism, patriotism, or national pride. This article innovates,
   first, by examining an unusually broad set of measures (from the 2004
   GSS) tapping national identification, ethnocultural and civic criteria
   for national membership, domain-specific national pride, and invidious
   comparisons to other nations, thus providing a fuller depiction of
   Americans' national self-understanding. Second, we use latent class
   analysis to explore heterogeneity, partitioning the sample into classes
   characterized by distinctive patterns of attitudes. Conventional
   distinctions between ethnocultural and civic nationalism describe just
   about half of the U.S. population and do not account for the
   unexpectedly low levels of national pride found among respondents who
   hold restrictive definitions of American nationhood. A subset of
   primarily younger and well-educated Americans lacks any strong form of
   patriotic sentiment; a larger class, primarily older and less well
   educated, embraces every form of nationalist sentiment. Controlling for
   sociodemographic characteristics and partisan identification, these

AB Assimilation is theorized as a multi-stage process where the structural
   mobility of immigrants and their descendants ultimately leads to
   established and immigrant-origin populations developing a subjective
   sense of social similarity with one another, an outcome I term symbolic
   belonging. Yet existing work offers little systematic evidence as to
   whether and how immigrants' gainsin terms of language ability,
   socioeconomic status, neighborhood integration, or intermarriagecause
   changes in the perceptions of the native-born U.S. population. I use a
   nationally representative conjoint survey experiment to explore whether
   and how immigrants' mobility gains shape native-born white citizens'
   perceptions of symbolic belonging. I find that white natives are
   generally open to structural relationships with immigrant-origin
   individuals (e.g., friends and neighbors), with the exception of black
   immigrants and natives, and undocumented immigrants. Yet, white
   Americans simultaneously view all non-white people, regardless of legal
   status, as dissimilar and far from achieving symbolic belonging in U.S.
   society. The results offer optimism about the potential structural
   mobility of legal immigrants and their descendants, yet simultaneously
   suggest that explicitly racialized lines of division remain just below
   the surface.

AB Using IPUMS data for five decennial years between 1970 and 2010, we
   delineate and compare the trends and sources of the racial pay gap among
   men and women in the U.S. labor force. Decomposition of the pay gap into
   components underscores the significance of the intersection between
   gender and race; we find meaningful gender differences in the
   composition of the gap and in the gross and the net earnings gapsboth
   are much larger among men than among women. Despite these differences,
   the over-time trend is strikingly similar for both genders. Racial gaps
   sharply declined between 1970 and 1980 and continued to decline, but at
   a slower rate, until 2000. However, at the turn of the millennium, the
   trend reversed for both gender groups. The growth of the racial pay gap
   at the turn of the millennium is attributable to the increase in overall
   income inequality, stagnation in occupational segregation, and an
   increase in the unexplained portion of the gap, a portion we attribute
   to economic discrimination.

AB The shift to more time-intensive and child-centered parenting in the
   United States is widely assumed to be positively linked to healthy child
   development, but implications for adult well-being are less clear. We
   assess multiple dimensions of parents' subjective well-being in
   activities with children and explore how the gendered nature of time
   potentially contributes to differences in mothers' and fathers'
   parenting experiences. Relying on nationally representative time diary
   data linked to respondents' feelings in activities from the 2010, 2012,
   and 2013 well-being module of the American Time Use Survey (N = 12,163
   persons and 36,036 activities), we find that parents consistently report
   greater subjective well-being in activities with children than without.
   Mothers, however, report less happiness, more stress, and greater
   fatigue in time with children than do fathers. These gaps are relatively
   small and can be accounted for by differences in the activities that
   mothers and fathers engage in with children, whether other adults are
   present, and the quality of their sleep and leisure. We go beyond prior
   work on parental happiness and life satisfaction to document how
   contemporary parenting is woven differently into the lives of mothers
   and fathers.

AB This article introduces the concept of orchestration as the mobilization
   of an intermediary by an orchestrator on a voluntary basis in pursuit of
   a joint governance goal. Orchestrator-Intermediary theory then provides
   a model of indirect governance that supplements delegation models
   premised on principal-agent theory. Under both theories, governors
   enhance their governance capacity by drawing on the capabilities of
   third parties. Whereas delegation is premised on hard 'contractual'
   control over the agent, however, orchestration relies on the soft
   control of like-minded intermediaries through material and ideational
   support. The two models overlap, and governors mix them in practice, but
   distinguishing between them analytically can broaden and deepen analysis
   of indirect forms of governance. This article discusses the
   circumstances under which each model provides a better fit for
   real-world problems, as well as the key limitations of each model. Among
   other things, orchestration is relatively more likely in democratic than
   authoritarian systems, when governors have limited direct capacities of
   their own and when veto players are more numerous. Orchestration is not
   always more desirable than delegation, but it provides an important
   alternative in some circumstances. Multiple examples from both domestic
   and international settings are used to illustrate this claim. The
   article closes with key considerations regarding the effectiveness and
   legitimacy of orchestration.

   finds that electoral coalitions are more frequent in newer democracies
   than in established democracies. The formation of alliances is
   systematically related to their potential costs and benefits. On the one
   hand, coalitions can provide small parties with legislative
   representation and larger parties with important government coalition
   partners. On the other hand, parties face costs related to their
   electoral compatibility and the sharing of election candidacies and

AB Most Americans support liberal policies on the social welfare agenda,
   the dominant policy cleavage in American politics. Yet a striking
   feature of the US party system is its tendency to equilibrium. How,
   then, does the Republican Party minimize defection on the social welfare
   agenda? The results of this study illustrate a deep ideological
   asymmetry between the parties. Republican identifiers are ideologically
   aware and oriented to a degree that far exceeds their Democratic
   counterparts. Our investigation, which utilizes cross-sectional,
   longitudinal and experimental data, demonstrates the role of ideological
   awareness and involvement in the Republicans' ability to maintain the
   backing of their supporters even on issues on which the position of the
   Democratic Party is widely popular. It also exposes two mechanisms,
   party branding and the use of the status quo as a focal point, that
   Democrats use to retain or rally support for issues on the social
   welfare agenda on which the Republican Party's position is widely
   popular.

AB Transparency is one of the most contested aspects of international
   organizations. While observers frequently call for greater oversight of
   policy making, evidence suggests that settlement between states is more
   likely when negotiations are conducted behind closed doors. The World
   Trade Organization's (WTO) legal body provides a useful illustration of
   these competing perspectives. As in many courts, WTO dispute settlement
   is designed explicitly to facilitate settlement through private
   consultations. However, this study argues that the privacy of
   negotiations creates opportunities for states to strike deals that
   disadvantage others. Looking at product-level trade flows from all
   disputes between 1995 and 2011, it finds that private (early)
   settlements lead to discriminatory trade outcomes - complainant
   countries gain disproportionately more than the rest of the membership.
   When the facts of a case are made known through a ruling, these
   disproportional gains disappear entirely. The article also finds that
   third-party participation - commonly criticized for making settlement
   less likely - significantly reduces disparities in post-dispute trade.
   It then draws parallels to domestic law and concludes with a set of
   policy prescriptions.

   approaches from international relations and judicial politics
   scholarship, we search every Supreme Court opinion between 1953 and 2009
   for references to foreign law. Justices strategically reference foreign
   law to prop up their most controversial opinions. They also borrow law
   from countries whose domestic political institutions are viewed as
   legitimate; and, surprisingly, conservatives are as likely as liberals
   to cite foreign law. These findings add important information to the

AB To what extent are adolescent mental health problems negatively related
   to educational attainment? If so, do these relationships primarily
   reflect childhood socio-economic circumstances that lower both mental
   health and educational attainment or do individuals' mental health
   vulnerabilities impede educational potential regardless of social
   origin? Using a population-based Norwegian health survey linked to
   administrative registry data, this study investigates the impact of
   adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems on educational
   attainment in adulthood (N = 8,113). Our results show consistent
   negative relationships between externalizing problems and educational
   outcomes, but for internalizing problems we find no associations net of
   other mental health problems. The observed associations for
   externalizing problems are robust to adjustment for sibling fixed
   effects, which indicates that the associations between mental health
   problems and educational attainment are generally not confounded by
   stable family-level characteristics shared by siblings. This finding
   lends most support to a 'social selection' explanation of the link
   between mental health problems and educational disparities-where
   individual variation in adolescent mental health leads to divergent
   educational trajectories irrespective of children's family background.
   We conclude that within-family variation in health is an important
   contributor to educational inequalities and socio-economic life chances.

   tropes of blackness within a system of racial capitalism, I show how
   complicity underscores the reality of differential aspirational models
   in the context of severe un- and underemployment and the failure of the
   classic breadwinner model for black men globally. I draw on participant
   observation fieldwork and interviews with men from Abidjan, Cote
   d'Ivoire's informal sector from 2008 to 2009. I investigate two groups
   of men: political propagandists (orators) for former President Laurent
   Gbagbo and mobile street vendors. Rejecting racialized colonial
   narratives that positioned salaried workers as evolved, orators used
   anti-French rhetoric and ties to the political regime to pursue
   entrepreneurial identities. Vendors, positioned as illegitimate workers
   and non-citizens, asserted consumerist models of masculinity from global

   to cue and persuade voters about national economic conditions is absent
   in the debate. This study uses a novel dataset containing monthly
   economic salience in party parliamentary speeches, macroeconomic
   indicators and individual survey data covering the four last electoral
   cycles in Spain (1996-2011). The results show that the salience of
   economic issues in the challenger's discourse substantially increases
   negative evaluations of performance when this challenger is the owner of
   the economic issue. While a challenger's conditioning of public economic
   evaluations is independent of the state of the economy (and can affect
   citizens with different ideological orientations), incumbent parties are
   more constrained by the true state of the economy in their ability to
   persuade the electorate on this issue.

AB Incumbent politicians tend to receive more votes when economic
   conditions are good. In this paper we explore the source of this
   correlation, exploiting the exceptional evidence provided by the Spanish
   Christmas Lottery. Because winning tickets are typically sold by one
   lottery outlet, winners tend to be geographically clustered. This allows
   us to study the impact of exogenous good economic conditions on voting
   behavior. We find that incumbents receive significantly more votes in
   winning provinces. The evidence is consistent with a temporary increase
   in happiness making voters more lenient toward the incumbent, or with a
   stronger preference for the status quo.

   document that nominal wages are downwardly rigid in emerging countries.
   We develop an open-economy model that incorporates this friction. The
   model predicts that the combination of a currency peg and free capital
   mobility creates a negative externality that causes over-borrowing
   during booms and high unemployment during contractions. Optimal capital
   controls are shown to be prudential. For plausible calibrations, they
   reduce unemployment by around 5 percentage points. The optimal exchange

   consequences for key institutions, such as states, markets and global

   destabilizing the Earth system constrains response to this emerging

   problematic path dependency. A more ecological discourse stresses
   resilience, foresight and state shifts in the Earth system. Ecosystemic
   reflexivity can be located as the first virtue of political institutions

   methods are used to assess the effects of different forms of membership

   Results demonstrate that organizational membership increases levels of
   nonconventional political action-for active and passive members in both
   political and civic groups. The "participatory dividend" is highest for
   members of political organizations, but there is also support for the
   argument that membership in civic organizations enhances political
   activism, net of selection. Focusing only on the subset of joiners,
   however, suggests that the distinction between active and passive

AB A new sociological agenda is emerging that interrogates how morality can
   be established in the absence of the moral certainties of the past but
   there is a shortage of empirical work on this topic. This article
   establishes a theoretical framework for the empirical analysis of
   everyday morality drawing on the work of theorists including Ahmed,
   Bauman and Taylor. It uses the Australian Survey of Social Attitudes to
   assess the state and shape of contemporary moralities by asking how kind
   are Australians, how is its expression socially distributed, and what
   are the motivations for kindness. The findings demonstrate that
   Australians exhibit a strong attachment and commitment to kindness as a
   moral value that is primarily motivated by interiorized sources of moral
   authority. We argue these findings support the work of theorists such as
   Ahmed and Taylor who argue authenticity and embodied emotion are
   legitimate sources of morality in today's secular societies. The
   research also provides new evidence that generational changes are
   shaping understandings and practices of kindness in unexpected ways.

   explains the dynamics of contemporary moral panics. The article
   concludes that Elias's meta-theory of the civilizing process potentially
   provides explanatory resources to investigate a possible
   historical-structural shift towards the so-called age of (a) moral
   panic; the analytical demands of such a project, however, require a
   sufficiently different line of inquiry than the one encouraged by both

AB This article aims at exploring a long-term historical perspective on
   which contemporary globalization can be more meaningfully situated. A
   central problem with established approaches to globalization is that
   they are even more presentist than the literature on modernization was.
   Presentism not only means the ignoring of history, but also the
   unreflective application to history of concepts taken from the study of
   the modern world. In contrast, it is argued that contemporary
   globalization is not a unique development, but rather is a concrete case
   of a historical type. Taking as its point of departure the spirit,
   rather than the word, of Max Weber, this article extends the scope of
   sociological investigation into archaeological evidence. Having a
   genealogical design and introducing the concept of 'liminality', the
   article approaches the modern process of globalization through
   reconstructing the internal dynamics of another type of historical
   change called 'social flourishing'. Taking up the Weberian approach
   continued by Eisenstadt in his writings on 'axial age', it moves away
   from situations of crisis as reference point, shifting attention to
   periods of revival by introducing the term 'epiphany'. Through the case
   of early Mesopotamia, it shows how social flourishing can be
   transmogrified into globalizing growth, gaining a new perspective
   concerning the kind of 'animating spirit' that might have driven the
   shift from Renaissance to Reformation, the rise of modern colonialism,
   or contemporary globalization. More generally, it will retrieve the
   long-term historical background of the axial age and demonstrate the
   usefulness and importance of archaeological evidence for sociology.

   and its application in post-socialist context has also been compellingly
   documented, waiting as a political artefact has only recently been
   receiving increased scholarly attention. Drawing on ethnographic
   fieldwork at a state-run unemployment office in Riga, this article shows
   how, alongside activation, state welfare policies also produce passivity
   and waiting. Engaging with the small but developing field of
   sociological literature on the politics of waiting, I argue that, rather
   than interpreting it as a clash between 'neo-liberal' and 'Soviet'
   regimes, we should understand the double-move of activation and
   imposition of waiting as a key mechanism of neo-liberal biopolitics.
   This article thus extends the existing theorizations of the temporal

AB This paper explores the empirical, conceptual and theoretical gains that
   can be made using cosmopolitan social theory to think through the urban
   transformations that scholars have in recent years termed planetary
   urbanization. Recognizing the global spread of urbanization makes the
   need for a cosmopolitan urban sociology more pressing than ever. Here,
   it is suggested that critical urban sociology can be invigorated by
   focusing upon the disconnect that Henri Lefebvre posits between the
   planetarization of the urban - which he views as economically and
   technologically driven - and his dis-alienated notion of a global urban
   society. The first aim of this paper is to highlight the benefits of
   using 'cosmopolitan' social theory to understand Lefebvre's urban
   problematic (and to establish why this is also a cosmopolitan
   problematic); the second is to identify the core cosmopolitan
   contradictions of planetary urbanization, tensions that are both
   actually existing and reproduced in scholarly accounts. The article
   begins by examining the challenges presented to urban sociology by
   planetary urbanization, before considering how cosmopolitan sociological
   theory helps provide an analytical 'grip' on the deep lying social
   realities of contemporary urbanization, especially in relation to
   questions about difference, culture and history. These insights are used
   to identify three cosmopolitan contradictions that exist within
   urbanized (and urbanizing) space; tensions that provide a basis for a
   thoroughgoing cosmopolitan investigation of planetary urbanization.

AB Despite cohabitation becoming increasingly equivalent to marriage in
   some of the most 'advanced' Western European societies, the vast

   on various approaches tied to cognitive decision-making, do not provide
   a sufficient explanation of the persistence of marriage. In this
   article, we argue that feelings attached to marriage, i.e. the affective
   evaluation of those involved in a partner relationship concerning
   marriage as opposed to cohabitation, explain the persistent importance
   of marriage as an institution. We argue that socialization, biological
   and social-structural factors affect these affective evaluations. We
   provide a test of our hypotheses using a longitudinal study of young
   adults in the Netherlands. The results of our analyses are consistent
   with a central role of feelings in the decision to marry, as well as
   with a role for key moderating factors such as gender.

   of targeted harassment to the identities of youth subcultural
   participants, through case study research on goths. It does so against a
   context of considerable recent public discussion about the victimization
   of alternative subcultures and a surprising scarcity of academic
   research on the subject. The analysis presented indicates that, although
   individual direct experiences are diverse, the spectre of harassment can
   form an ever-present accompaniment to subcultural life, even for those
   who have never been seriously targeted. As such, it forms part of what
   it is to be a subcultural participant and comprises significant common
   ground with other members. Drawing upon classic and more recent
   understandings of how subcultural groups respond to broader forms of
   outside hostility, we show how the shared experience of feeling targeted
   for harassment tied in with a broader subcultural discourse of being
   stigmatized by a perceived 'normal' society. The role of harassment as
   part of this, we argue, contributed to the strength with which
   subcultural identities were felt and to a positive embrace of otherness.

AB The optimal design of redistributive systems continues to be a matter of
   considerable academic and public debate, with the optimal extent and
   intensity of pro-poor targeting remaining a key issue of contention.
   This article shows, first, that the overall relationship between
   pro-poor targeting and income inequality reduction is very weak.
   Although occasionally the association is positive, it is not robust,
   very weak, and effectively zero with various reasonable methodological
   decisions. Second, and more importantly, a detailed disaggregated
   analysis reveals that the most redistributive systems do contain
   subsystems that are strongly targeted to the poor by intent and by
   design. Third, we also show that a disaggregation over the function of
   social transfers is very relevant: old-age benefits are an important
   driver of the weak overall association, while for family benefits we
   find a positive relationship. Absolutely key, however, is our finding
   that means-tested systems play a crucial role in bringing about
   redistributive effectiveness, even if their relative size is small. We
   thus shed new light on the politics of targeting. While it remains
   important that broad sections of the electorate benefit from social
   transfers, strong pro-poor targeting within such a context is possible
   and indeed essential for real redistributive impact. Benefits for the
   poor need not be poor benefits if and when these are embedded in benefit
   systems that meet wider redistributive needs and rationales.

   influence of early exposure to neighborhood violence on growth in
   standardized test scores over time. Student fixed effects are included
   to remove any bias due to constant differences between students. The
   results show that children from more violent neighborhoods fall farther
   behind their peers from safer neighborhoods as they progress through

AB In the United States, the past 50 years have witnessed a remarkable
   expansion of formal associations in residential neighborhoods, including
   homeowners associations, condo associations, crime watch groups, tenant
   associations, and special-interest neighborhood coalitions. Despite
   their prevalence and growing role in neighborhood governance, the
   relationship of these associations to interpersonal trust and networks
   among residents and outsiders remains understudied. Drawing on the
   Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS), we estimate the
   impact of neighborhood association membership on bonding and bridging
   social capital in a nationally representative sample of residents. Among
   non-homeowners, our findings suggest that neighborhood association
   membership is linked to bonding social capital (such as a propensity to
   socialize and cooperate with neighbors and a positive perception of
   impact on community conditions), as well as bridging social capital
   (such as a greater likelihood of trust in racial out-groups). These
   benefits from neighborhood association membership are attenuated or
   reversed among homeowners. The results underscore the need for social
   scientists to consider the inherent tension in neighborhood
   associations, as institutions that ensure the protection of property
   values, on the one hand, and that promote neighborhood cooperation and
   quality of life, on the other.

AB Hundreds of thousands of workers die on the job each year around the
   world, with disproportionately high fatality rates in the global South.
   Using fixed effects regression models for 51 countries located in the
   global South, this research examines how shifts in state context, ties
   to international organizations, and economic context affect worker
   fatalities from 1985 and 2002. We find that strengthening collective
   labor rights-the ability to protest and form worker organizations free
   from repression-is tightly linked to fewer fatalities. Certain forms of
   global institutional ties are related to workers' deaths. Increased
   links to international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) are
   associated with fewer deaths. Ratification of International Labour
   Organization (ILO) conventions, however, is decoupled from fatalities.
   We examine ratification of a specific safety convention, as well as
   general embeddedness in the ILO, as represented by ratification of the
   fundamental conventions. Finally, measures of economic globalization,
   Foreign Direct Investment and exports, have no significant relationship
   to fatalities, net of socio-political factors. To unpack the mechanisms
   underlying the quantitative results, we present three illustrations:
   construction workers in Uruguay, garment workers in Bangladesh, and
   miners in South Africa.

AB While flexibility in the location of work hours has shown positive
   organizational effects on productivity and retention, less is known
   about the earnings effects of telecommuting. We analyze weekly hours
   spent working from home using the 1989-2008 panels of the National
   Longitudinal Study of Youth. We describe the demographic and
   occupational characteristics of the employees engaged in telecommuting,
   then track their earnings growth with fixed-effects models, focusing on
   gender and parental status. Results show substantial variation in the
   earnings effects of telecommuting based on the point in the hours
   distribution worked from home. Working from home rather than the office
   produces equal earnings growth in the first 40 hours worked, but "taking
   work home" or overtime telecommuting yields significantly smaller
   increases than overtime worked on-site. Yet, most observed telecommuting
   occurs precisely during this low-yield overtime portion of the hours
   distribution. Few gender or parental status differences emerged in these
   processes. These trends reflect potentially widespread negative
   consequences of the growing capacity of workers to perform their work
   from any location. Rather than enhancing true flexibility in when and
   where employees work, the capacity to work from home mostly extends the
   workday and encroaches into what was formerly home and family time.

AB Patterns of partnership formation and dissolution are changing
   dramatically across the Western world. Some scholars have argued that
   women's trajectories of union formation and dissolution are diverging by
   education, with the higher educated postponing but eventually marrying
   and the lower educated more likely to cohabit or divorce if they do
   marry. At the same time, the variation in partnership behavior has also
   increased across countries, suggesting that country context plays an
   important role. Here, we use latent class growth models to compare the
   educational gradient of partnership trajectories in the United States
   and 14 countries in Europe and investigate the role of education and
   country context. Our results indicate a consistent positive educational
   gradient for partnership patterns showing the postponement of marriage,
   regardless of whether marriage was preceded by cohabitation, but a less
   consistent gradient for patterns reflecting long-term cohabitation and
   union dissolution. Although the US results show evidence of an
   educational divergence in marriage and union dissolution, the evidence
   from the other countries is weak. In addition, country context explains
   more of the variation in class membership than education, with context
   becoming more important over time. The divergence in behaviors across
   country contexts suggests that social, cultural, political, and economic
   developments are essential for understanding changes in partnership
   formation and dissolution.

AB Parents play a key role in launching their children into adulthood.
   Differences in the resources they provide their children have
   implications for perpetuating patterns of family inequality. Using data
   on 6,962 young adults included in the National Longitudinal Survey of
   Youth 1997, we examine differences in the support parents provide to
   young adult children by immigrant status and race/ethnicity and whether
   and how those differences are explained by parent resources and young
   adult resources and roles. Immigrant status and race/ethnicity are
   associated with patterns of support in complex ways. We find that
   racial/ethnic and immigrant disparities in perceptions of support,
   financial support, and receiving advice from parents about education or
   employment are explained by family socioeconomic resources. Group
   differences in whether young adults say they would turn to a parent for
   advice and coresidence persist after accounting for these factors,
   however. Young adult resources and roles also shape parental support of
   young adults in the transition to adulthood, but taking account of these
   characteristics does not explain immigrant and racial/ethnic group
   differences. Our findings highlight the need to consider both
   race/ethnicity and immigrant status to understand family relationships
   and sources of support.

AB The purpose of this paper is to quantitatively assess the drivers of
   suffering from disasters across less developed nations, with specific
   emphasis on the gender relations that potentially mitigate the breadth
   of devastation across affected populations. We draw on theoretical
   frameworks of environmental sociology, ecofeminism, gender inequalities,
   and development to inform our empirical analysis, which represents
   structural equation modeling of 85 less developed nations. While
   economic, political, and to a lesser extent environmental factors have
   been linked, theoretically and empirically, to vulnerability to natural
   disaster events, few consider the potential of improving women's status
   to alleviate the toll of disasters on humans in affected nations. Our
   paper addresses this gap by theoretically developing and empirically
   analyzing the linkages that connect the environment, women's economic
   standing, and disaster vulnerability. Our findings point to the
   beneficial effects of improving women's status-itself conditioned by
   ecological and developmental factors-to limit the extent of human strife
   resulting from disaster events in important direct and indirect ways.
   Conclusions also point to interrelationships among additional social,
   economic, political, and ecological conditions in determining the
   distribution of disaster harm and death, such as ecological losses,
   democracy, underdevelopment, and provisions for health resources.

AB We examine the causes of movement and countermovement mobilization,
   focusing specifically on the effect that the national movements have on
   each other by responding directly to mobilization and indirectly through
   their policy successes. We discuss the mechanisms by which national
   movements respond to each other, and we examine the influence of
   political parties and social, political, and economic changes for women.
   We analyze these relationships using a Poisson Autoregressive (PAR(rho))
   estimator, which is uniquely designed to model both the time dependence
   and the count distributions, on quarterly time series of feminist,
   anti-feminist, pro-choice, and anti-abortion events. Results show that
   movements and countermovements respond to each other and that
   anti-feminist movements mobilize in response to national policy change
   and societal change. The results suggest that many quantitative analyses
   of women's movements may be misspecified and that feminist mobilization
   does not always abate during conservative backlash.

AB Previous cross-national research suggests that women may be less likely
   to prefer family-based support to older adults and more likely to prefer
   government-based support compared to men. Guided by theories of gendered
   paid and unpaid labor, social network resources and strain, and global
   inequality, this paper investigates whether a gender gap in attitudes
   exists and, if so, whether it can be explained by characteristics of
   family, work, social networks and roles, and national context. Analyzing
   data from two cross-sectional International Social Survey Programme
   samples ( 2001, N = 23,360; 2012, N = 16,558) and aggregate nation-
   level data sources across 20 nations, the authors use multilevel
   modeling to predict four measures of attitudes toward family-based
   and/or government-based support. We find evidence of a small gender gap
   in attitudes. Overall, women are less likely to agree that children have
   a duty, more likely to say the government should definitely be
   responsible, and more likely to prefer that the government pay for care
   instead of the family/individual compared to men. Family resources,
   social support, occupational insecurity, and role strain are each
   associated with attitudes in the theorized directions, but only
   partially explain the gender gap in attitudes. Finally, attitudes toward
   older adult support vary predictably by national cultural, political,
   and economic measures, but the gender gap in attitudes varies
   cross-nationally and is likely limited to specific contexts. We discuss
   these findings in light of measurement options, gendered patterns of
   care cross-nationally, and global disparities in formal resources for
   caregiving.

AB Stroke is among the leading causes of disability and death in the United
   States, and racial differences are greater for stroke than for all other
   major chronic diseases. Considering the equally sizeable racial
   disparities in marital life and associated risks across adulthood, the
   current study hypothesizes that black-white differences in marital
   history play an important role in the large racial inequalities in the
   incidence of stroke. The major objective are to (i) demonstrate how
   marital history is associated with the incidence of stroke, (ii) examine
   how marital factors mediate and/or moderate racial disparities in
   stroke, and (iii) examine the factors that may explain the associations.
   Using retrospective and prospective data from the Health and Retirement
   Study (n = 23,289), the results show that non-Hispanic (NH) blacks have
   significantly higher rates of marital instability, greater numbers of
   health-risk factors, and substantially higher rates of stroke compared
   with NH whites. Contrary to the cumulative disadvantage hypothesis,
   findings from discrete-time-hazard models show that the effects of
   marital history are more pronounced for NH whites than for NH blacks.
   Risks for stroke were significantly higher in NH whites who were
   currently divorced, remarried, and widowed, as well as in those with a
   history of divorce or widowhood, compared with NH whites who were
   continuously married. In NH blacks, risks for stroke were elevated only
   in those who had either never married or had been widowed-with no
   significant risks attributable to divorce. The potential mechanisms
   underlying the associations are assessed, and the implications of the
   findings are discussed.
