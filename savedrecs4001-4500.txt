AB This paper draws on theories of socio-economic change stemming from
   political economy and economic sociology to examine the financialization
   of the US forest products industry. I argue that the widespread adoption
   of shareholder value norms of corporate governance constitutes one of
   the core ideological foundations for explaining how the financialization
   of non-financial firms was accomplished. At the same time, I suggest
   that economic sociologists' emphasis on the role of shareholder value
   ideology tends to obscure the concrete realities of contemporary
   capitalism and the socio-economic relations that underlie managerial
   conceptions of control. In this paper, I adopt a dialectical methodology
   that works at multiple levels of abstraction in order to highlight the
   internal relationship that exists between managerial conceptions of
   control and the material processes of capital accumulation. Using data
   mined from corporate proxy statements, I show that increases in
   concentrated stock ownership among institutional investors and the use
   of incentive-based compensation-among other important factors-underlie
   the adoption of shareholder value strategies in the US forest products
   sector. I then demonstrate how the pursuit of shareholder value reshaped
   the US forest products in the interests of the financial community while
   undermining long-term stability of the industry and the people who
   depend on it.

   Less prepared minorities at higher ranked campuses had lower persistence

   differ across campuses and student preparation. We find less prepared
   minority students at top ranked campuses would have higher science
   graduation rates had they attended lower ranked campuses. Better
   matching of science students to universities by preparation and
   providing information about students' prospects in different

AB All sociologists recognize that social constraints affect individuals'
   outcomes. These effects are sometimes relatively direct. Other times
   constraints affect outcomes indirectly, first influencing individuals'
   personal characteristics, which then affect their outcomes. In the
   latter case, the social becomes personal, and personal characteristics
   that are carried across situations (e.g., skills, habits, identities,
   worldviews, preferences, or values) affect individuals' outcomes. I
   argue here for the importance of both direct and indirect effects of
   constraints on outcomes. I disagree with the tendency among sociologists
   to avoid views highlighting the role of personal characteristics because
   of the perceptionincorrect in my viewthat these explanations blame the
   victim and ignore constraints. To illustrate the importance of both
   types of mechanisms, I explore two empirical cases involving how gender
   and class structure sexualities. First, I show that young men engage in
   same-sex relations less than women and have more heterosexist attitudes,
   and I ask why. Second, I provide evidence that people from disadvantaged
   class backgrounds are especially likely to have unintended pregnancies
   and nonmarital births, and I explore why. In each case, I provide
   evidence that both kinds of mechanisms are operatingmechanisms entailing
   direct effects of constraints on outcomes, and mechanisms in which
   constraints shape personal characteristics, which, in turn, affect
   outcomes.

AB Taking advantage of historical census records that include full first
   and last names, we apply a new approach to measuring the effect of
   cultural assimilation on economic success for the children of the last
   great wave of immigrants to the United States. We created a quantitative
   index of ethnic distinctiveness of first names and show the consequences
   of ethnic-sounding names for the occupational achievement of the adult
   children of European immigrants. We find a consistent tendency for the
   children of Irish, Italian, German, and Polish immigrants with more
   American-sounding names to have higher occupational achievement. About
   one-third of this effect appears to be due to social class differences
   in name-giving, and the remaining two-thirds to signaling effects of the
   names themselves. An exception is found for Russian, predominantly
   Jewish, immigrants, where we find a positive effect of ethnic naming on
   occupational achievement. The divergent effects of our new measure of
   cultural assimilation, sometimes hurting and sometimes helping, lend
   historical empirical support to more recent theories of the advantages
   of different paths to assimilation. The effects of ethnic first names
   are also found for a restricted analysis of recognizably ethnic last
   names, suggesting that immigrants' success depended on being perceived
   as making an effort to assimilate rather than hiding their origins.

AB Drawing from cumulative inequality theory, we examine the relationship
   between childhood disadvantage and health problems in adulthood. Using
   two waves of data from Midlife Development in the United States, we
   investigate whether childhood disadvantage is associated with adult
   disadvantage, including fewer social resources, and the effect of
   lifelong disadvantage on health problems measured at the baseline survey
   and a 10-year follow-up. Findings reveal that childhood socioeconomic
   disadvantage and frequent abuse by parents are generally associated with
   fewer adult social resources and more lifestyle risks. Health problems,
   in turn, are affected by childhood disadvantage and by lifestyle risks,
   especially smoking and obesity. Not only was early disadvantage related
   to health problems at the baseline survey, but childhood socioeconomic
   disadvantage and frequent abuse also were related to the development of
   new health problems at the follow-up survey. These findings reveal the
   imprint of early disadvantage on health decades later and suggest
   greater attention to resources, even during midlife, can interrupt the
   chain of risks.

AB Durkheim conceived of suicide as a product of social integration and
   regulation. Although the sociology of suicide has focused on the role of
   disintegration, to our knowledge, the interaction between integration
   and regulation has yet to be empirically evaluated. In this article we
   test whether more egalitarian gender norms, an important form of
   macro-regulation, protects men and women against suicidality during
   economic shocks. Using cross-national data covering 20 European Union
   countries from the years 1991 to 2011, including the recent economic
   crises in Europe, we first assessed the relation between unemployment
   and suicide. Then we evaluated potential effect modification using three
   measures of gender equality, the gender ratio in labour force
   participation, the gender pay gap, and women's representation in
   parliament using multiple measures. We found no evidence of a
   significant, direct link between greater gender equality and suicide
   rates in either men or women. However, a greater degree of gender
   equality helped protect against suicidality associated with economic
   shocks. At relatively high levels of gender equality in Europe, such as
   those seen in Sweden and Austria, the relationship between rising
   unemployment rates and suicide in men disappeared altogether. Our
   findings suggest that more egalitarian forms of gender regulation may
   help buffer the suicidal consequences of economic shocks, especially in
   men.

AB It is commonly hypothesized that higher cognitive abilities promote
   racial tolerance and a greater commitment to racial equality, but an
   alternative theoretical framework contends that higher cognitive
   abilities merely enable members of a dominant racial group to articulate
   a more refined legitimizing ideology for racial inequality. According to
   this perspective, ideological refinement occurs in response to shifting
   patterns of racial conflict and is characterized by rejection of overt
   prejudice, superficial support for racial equality in principle, and
   opposition to policies that challenge the dominant group's status. This
   study estimates the impact of verbal ability on a comprehensive set of
   racial attitudes, including anti-black prejudice, views about
   black-white equality in principle, and racial policy support. It also
   investigates cohort differences in the effects of verbal ability on
   these attitudes. Results suggest that high-ability whites are less
   likely than low-ability whites to report prejudicial attitudes and more
   likely to support racial equality in principle. Despite these
   liberalizing effects, high-ability whites are no more likely to support
   a variety of remedial policies for racial inequality. Results also
   suggest that the ostensibly liberalizing effects of verbal ability on
   anti-black prejudice and views about racial equality in principle
   emerged slowly over time, consistent with ideological refinement theory.

AB Many surveys of respondents from multiple countries or subnational
   regions have now been fielded on multiple occasions. Social scientists
   are regularly using multilevel models to analyse the data generated by
   such surveys, investigating variation across both space and time. We
   show, however, that such models are usually specified erroneously. They
   typically omit one or more relevant random effects, thereby ignoring
   important clustering in the data, which leads to downward biases in the
   standard errors. These biases occur even if the fixed effects are
   specified correctly; if the fixed effects are incorrect, erroneous
   specification of the random effects worsens biases in the coefficients.
   We illustrate these problems using Monte Carlo simulations and two
   empirical examples. Our recommendation to researchers fitting multilevel
   models to comparative longitudinal survey data is to include random
   effects at all potentially relevant levels, thereby avoiding any
   mismatch between the random and fixed parts of their models.

AB Studies demonstrate a negative association between community ethnic
   diversity and indicators of social cohesion (especially attitudes
   towards neighbours and the community), suggesting diversity causes a
   decline in social cohesion. However, to date, the evidence for this
   claim is based solely on cross-sectional research. This article performs
   the first longitudinal test of the impact of diversity, applying
   fixed-effects modelling methods to three waves of panel data from the
   British Household Panel Survey, spanning a period of 18 years. Using an
   indicator of affective attachment, the findings suggest that changes in
   community diversity do lead to changes in attitudes towards the
   community. However, this effect differs by whether the change in
   diversity stems from a community increasing in diversity around
   individuals who do not move (stayers) or individuals moving into more or
   less diverse communities (movers). Increasing diversity undermines
   attitudes among stayers. Individuals who move from a diverse to a
   homogeneous community report improved attitudes. However, there is no
   effect among individuals who move from a homogeneous to a diverse
   community. This article provides strong evidence that the effect of
   community diversity is likely causal, but that prior preferences
   for/against out-group neighbours may condition diversity's impact. It
   also demonstrates that multiple causal processes are in operation at the
   individual-level, occurring among both stayers and movers, which
   collectively contribute to the emergence of average cross-sectional
   differences in attitudes between communities. Unique insights into the
   causal impact of community disadvantage also emerge.

AB Contact between children and divorced fathers is often believed to
   strengthen the negative effect of interparental postdivorce conflict on
   children's well-being. Although this is a well-known hypothesis, there
   is surprisingly little evidence for it. This article examines the
   hypothesis using large-scale nationally representative data on secondary
   school students in the Netherlands. The hypothesis is tested using
   interactions of conflict with postdivorce contact and interactions of
   conflict with co-parenting. We find that children of divorced parents
   have more depressive symptoms than children of married parents.
   Interparental conflict after divorce increases children's depressive
   symptoms, while father-child contact has no effect. There is a
   significant interaction between interparental conflict and father-child
   contact: interparental conflict increases depression more when there is
   more contact between the father and the child. This is only observed for
   boys and not for girls. For girls, depression is increased when the
   quality of the tie to the father is poorer. Theoretical explanations are
   suggested in terms of exposure effects and conflicting loyalties.

AB This article investigates whether self-interest as compared with values
   or ideological dispositions shapes individual attitudes towards the
   welfare state. Causal interpretations of how self-interest, values, and
   welfare state attitudes are linked have been difficult to sustain so
   far, as the research mainly relies on static, cross-sectional analyses.
   We address this empirical challenge using data from the Dutch
   Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel (2008-2013)
   that covers the period of the international economic crisis. We
   investigate how individuals change their attitudes in times of economic
   hardship. Our findings confirm theoretical expectations that people
   change their support for unemployment benefits in reaction to changes in
   their individual material circumstances. Job loss leads to an increased
   support for public provision of unemployment benefits. The analysis also
   suggests that this attitude change is persistent. After the temporarily
   unemployed have found a new job, they do not return to their
   pre-unemployment attitude. In contrast, individual support for life
   course-related domains of the welfare state such as health care or
   pensions is not affected by changes in individual material
   circumstances. Our results show that individual material circumstances
   and thus self-interest have a sizable effect on how individuals change
   their welfare state attitudes.

AB We investigate an often overlooked implication of the signalling model
   of statistical discrimination: if immigrant minorities' educational
   qualifications carry less signalling power, poorly qualified minority
   members should experience positive statistical discrimination. We argue
   that the lower signalling power stems from disadvantages associated with
   insufficient language skills and lack of supportive parental resources,
   which prevent minority students from achieving those educational
   qualifications that would reflect their high motivation and ambition.
   Yet, if education counts less, so does its lack. Using data from the
   German Microcensus, we compare log hourly personal income of 1.5th and
   2nd generation Spa "taussiedler and persons of Turkish origin with that
   of native Germans. Using (semi-parametric) generalized additive models,
   we find solid support for our claim that poorly qualified persons of
   Turkish origin experience income advantages; they frequently work in
   jobs for which they are under-qualified. Once different frequencies of
   over- and under-education are taken into account, no ethnic differences
   in educational returns remain. Our results extend to other comparable
   immigrant groups in Germany.

AB In recent decades, women have made impressive inroads in education and
   the labour market in most countries; yet, they often remain
   under-represented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
   professions. One way to understand women's under-representation in STEM
   is to examine how boys and girls develop their career expectations
   during adolescence, as this is a critical time when individuals begin to
   plan their futures. Prior cross-national research finds that gender
   stratification in education, work, and politics in a country affects the
   size of male-favourable gender gaps on math and science achievement
   tests for adolescents. Countries with more gender equality have smaller
   gender gaps in math and science. But, it is unknown how gender
   stratification or cultural ideologies impact the development of boys'
   and girls' STEM career expectations. Do countries with less gender
   equality have smaller male-favourable gender gaps in STEM career
   expectations? Do countries with less gender egalitarian have larger
   male-favourable gender gaps in STEM career expectations? Using data on
   student's occupational expectations from the 2006 Program for
   International Student Assessment and data on country-level gender
   stratification and gende-regalitarian ideologies from the World Bank and
   European Values Survey, I study the gender gap in 15-year-olds'
   expectations to enter a STEM career across 24 countries.

AB Past research on gender role attitudes has often focused on
   individual-rather than country-level explanations. Drawing on European
   Social Survey data from 21 countries, we examine the effect of societal
   normative climates (i.e., shared perceptions of others' attitudes) on
   personal attitudes towards two non-traditional gender roles: Voluntary
   childlessness and working full-time while children are young. To detect
   potential gender differences, we analyse disapproval of men and women
   separately. Findings reveal that there are strong differences in
   normative climates across countries, and that people generally perceive
   more disapproval of women than of men for both behaviours. Most
   importantly, in countries where a higher share of respondents perceives
   disapproval of these behaviours, respondents themselves disapprove more
   strongly-even if they do not believe that others disapprove, and even
   after controlling for other relevant individual-and country-level
   characteristics. What is more, the independent effect of normative
   climate explains most of the differences between countries. This robust
   finding demonstrates the power of country-level normative climates in
   explaining individuals' attitudes and between-country differences in
   attitudes toward gender roles.

AB The present study builds on previous work by Andresen by examining the
   effects of entry into the European Union (EU) on the levels of homicide
   in the 10 Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 and
   2007. Andresen's research has indicated that accession to the EU led to
   increased levels of violent crime across municipalities in Lithuania
   over the 2001-2006 period. We go beyond prior work by using pooled
   cross-sectional time-series data that cover approximately 20 years for
   these 10 Eastern European nations. The results from fixed-effects
   regression analyses at the national level are generally consistent with
   Andresen's research, indicating that entry into the EU is positively
   associated with levels of homicide. In addition, we find that economic
   growth has a negative effect on homicide rates, whereas the divorce rate
   and income inequality have positive effects on homicide rates. These
   findings reaffirm for the sample of Eastern European countries results
   reported for other cross-national samples. However, our analyses also
   reveal that these structural covariates do not account for the observed
   relationship between EU entry and homicide rates. We conclude with a
   discussion of the some of the mechanisms that might be responsible for
   the EU effect.

AB Using hierarchal linear models fitted to survey data from the 1999 and
   2009 International Social Survey Program Social Inequality module, this
   article examines how social mobility shapes class identification in 33
   societies. My concern is with how social mobility-both at the individual
   level and the country level-affects class identification. The findings
   demonstrate that both one's own social class and their class origin
   influence class identification. On the other hand, national-level
   absolute mobility does not meaningfully shape class identification. This
   finding implies that people either consider only their own economic
   conditions-i.e. they care little about the conditions in which others
   live-or they are unaware of actual levels of mobility within their
   country. Finally, I build on previous research by demonstrating the
   importance of national-level income inequality. As income inequality
   rises, middle-class identities become weaker-regardless of one's social
   class position-because the adverse effects of inequality are felt more
   acutely across the class structure.

AB The gender segregation of occupations is an enduring feature of the
   labour market, and pay in female-dominated occupations remains lower
   than in male-dominated occupations. However, recent changes in the
   occupational structure have possibly altered the relationship between
   occupational segregation and the gender pay gap. Women's skills are
   increasingly in demand, and this is reducing the gender wage gap. We
   explore this premise using individual-and occupation-level Labour Force
   Survey and household panel data from Britain augmented with an
   innovative proxy indicator of productivity across occupations. The wage
   effects of occupational feminization are not as high as previously shown
   once this indicator is taken into account. Additionally, we find
   evidence that such wage effects are evolving into more complex
   processes, including differing impacts for graduates and non-graduates
   as well as for employees in graduate and non-graduate jobs. Claims that
   gender segregation is losing importance as a structuring factor in
   labour-market outcomes are therefore accurate. However, this applies
   mostly to women in jobs requiring high-level skills. Segregation
   continues to lower pay substantially for women in occupations requiring
   limited skills.

AB Programs to encourage labor market activity among youth, including
   public employment programs and wage subsidies like the Work Opportunity
   Tax Credit, can be supported by three broad rationales. They may (i)
   provide contemporaneous income support to participants; (ii) encourage
   work experience that improves future employment and/or educational
   outcomes of participants; and/or (iii) keep participants "out of
   trouble." We study randomized lotteries for access to the New York City
   (NYC) Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP), the largest summer youth
   employment program in the United States, by merging SYEP administrative
   data on 294,100 lottery participants to IRS data on the universe of U.S.
   tax records; to New York State administrative incarceration data; and to
   NYC administrative cause of death data. In assessing the three
   rationales, we find that (i) SYEP participation causes average earnings
   and the probability of employment to increase in the year of program
   participation, with modest contemporaneous crowdout of other earnings
   and employment; (ii) SYEP participation causes a modest decrease in
   average earnings for three years following the program and has no impact
   on college enrollment; and (iii) SYEP participation decreases the
   probability of incarceration and decreases the probability of mortality,
   which has important and potentially pivotal implications for analyzing
   the net benefits of the program.

   covering the surface of the earth, we find that the impact of climate
   change on these agricultural markets would amount to a 0.26 percent
   reduction in global GDP when trade and production patterns are allowed
   to adjust. Since the value of output in our 10 crops is equal to 1.8
   percent of world GDP, this corresponds to about one-sixth of total crop

   Zimmerman case-to interrogate the racialized construction of crime and,
   specifically, extend moral panic theory to the contemporary context of
   racial colorblindness. Analyzing 542 local news stories, I find the
   Goetz case was framed as a moral panic, while Zimmerman coverage
   exhibited a moral breach. The Zimmercan case: (1) is characterized by
   competing, rather than complementary, narratives; (2) reframes "folk
   devils" as victims and disrupts clear-cut allocations of blame; (3)
   emphasizes harm to communities rather than harm to social order; and (4)
   elicits calls for dialogue and acknowledgement rather than collective
   punishment and shaming. Unpacking what the different styles of narrative
   mean for racialized constructions of victims and criminals and the
   social construction of harm, threat, and social action, I argue that,
   despite the greater attention to race found in Zimmerman coverage, moral
   breaches tend to compartmentalize social problems and thus narrow their
   impact.

AB Given the prestige and compensation of science and math-related
   occupations, the underrepresentation of women and people of color in
   science, technology, engineering, and mathematics majors (STEM)
   perpetuates entrenched economic and social inequities. Explanations for
   this underrepresentation have largely focused on individual
   characteristics, including uneven academic preparation, as well as
   institutional factors at the college level. In this article, we focus
   instead on high schools. We highlight the influence of the intersection
   between race and gender of female math and science teachers on students'
   decisions to major in STEM fields. Theoretically, this article extends
   the political science concept of representative bureaucracy to the issue
   of women's and disadvantaged minorities' underrepresentation in STEM
   majors. We analyze longitudinal data from public school students in
   North Carolina to test whether organizational demography of high school
   math and science faculty has an association with college major choice
   and graduation. Using hierarchical pro-bit models with an
   instrumental-variable approach, we find that young white women are more
   likely to major in STEM fields and to graduate with STEM degrees when
   they come from high schools with higher proportions of female math and
   science teachers, irrespective of the race of the teacher. At the same
   time, these teachers do not depress young white or African American
   men's chances of majoring in STEM. Results for African American women
   are less conclusive, highlighting the limitations of their small sample
   size.

AB While research provides numerous insights about the fear and insecurity
   that Latino immigrants experience at the hands of the police, much less
   is known about the experiences and practices of local police vis-a-vis
   Latino immigrant residents. This article contributes to research on
   street-level bureaucracies and immigrant incorporation by examining
   police practices in a new immigrant destination. Drawing on two years of
   fieldwork with the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, it offers
   an extended ethnographic look at policing dilemmas in the era of
   immigration control. As the findings reveal, police bureaucracies
   respond to immigrant residents in contradictory ways. On one hand, the
   department has an official community policing program to increase trust
   and communication with Latino immigrant residents. On the other hand,
   street-level patrol officers undermine these efforts by citing and
   arresting Latino residents who lack state-issued ID. Thus, alongside
   ostensibly sincere efforts to incorporate immigrant residents,
   ultimately, police produce a form of social control and urban discipline
   through their discretionary decisions.

AB This article proposes an institutional approach to political engagement
   that reorients inquiry from individual characteristics and social
   capital to organizational contexts and the institutional practices that
   shape how members interpret political opportunities. Using data from the
   2006 Pew Changing Faiths Survey, I draw from the case of faith-based
   Latino mobilization into the 2006 immigrant rights protests to show that
   the impact of organizational participation on protest depends on
   institutional practices that define, focus, and direct member interests.
   I apply this argument to two relevant types of institutionally defined
   social capital: ethnic and religious. In the case of ethnic social
   capital, I find that ethnic church attendance amplified Hispanic
   national origin differences in protest rates in a manner consistent with
   differential treatment under U.S. immigration policy. In the case of
   religious social capital, I find that active religious involvement only
   increased the likelihood of protest when churches institutionally
   supported protest. Together, these findings suggest that a key mechanism
   linking nonpolitical organizations to protest is their ability to define
   and direct collective interest through institutional practices.

AB Since the Coleman Report, many have questioned whether public school
   spending affects student outcomes. The school finance reforms that began
   in the early 1970s and accelerated in the 1980s caused dramatic changes
   to the structure of K-12 education spending in the United States. To
   study the effect of these school finance reform-induced changes in
   public school spending on long-run adult outcomes, we link school
   spending and school finance reform data to detailed, nationally
   representative data on children born between 1955 and 1985 and followed
   through 2011. We use the timing of the passage of court-mandated reforms
   and their associated type of funding formula change as exogenous
   shifters of school spending, and we compare the adult outcomes of
   cohorts that were differentially exposed to school finance reforms,
   depending on place and year of birth. Event study and instrumental
   variable models reveal that a 10% increase in per pupil spending each
   year for all 12 years of public school leads to 0.31 more completed
   years of education, about 7% higher wages, and a 3.2 percentage point
   reduction in the annual incidence of adult poverty; effects are much
   more pronounced for children from low-income families. Exogenous
   spending increases were associated with notable improvements in measured
   school inputs, including reductions in student-to-teacher ratios,
   increases in teacher salaries, and longer school years.

AB While scholars have studied the racial "achievement gap" for several
   decades, the mechanisms that produce this gap remain unclear. In this
   article, we propose that school discipline is a crucial, but
   under-examined, factor in achievement differences by race. Using a large
   hierarchical and longitudinal data set comprised of student and school
   records, we examine the impact of student suspension rates on racial
   differences in reading and math achievement. This analysis-the first of
   its kind-reveals that school suspensions account for approximately
   one-fifth of black-white differences in school performance. The findings
   suggest that exclusionary school punishment hinders academic growth and
   contributes to racial disparities in achievement. We conclude by
   discussing the implications for racial inequality in education.

AB Standard business cycle models have difficulties generating large,

   financial intermediation based on Curdia-Woodford, we show that fiscal
   multipliers can be strongly state dependent: fiscal expansions during
   recessions may lead to multiplier values exceeding two, while similar
   expansions during economic booms would produce values falling short of
   unity. This pattern obtains if the spread (the financial friction) is
   more sensitive to fiscal policy during recessions than during
   expansions, a feature that is present in the data. Our results are
   consistent with recent empirical work documenting the state contingency
   of multipliers.

AB A sizable literature examines whether and why marriage affects men's and
   women's wages. This study advances current research in two ways. First,
   whereas most prior studies treat the effect of marriage as
   time-invariant, I examine how the wage effect of marriage unfolds over
   the life course. Second, whereas prior work often focuses on the
   population-average effect of marriage or is limited to some particular
   gender or racial group, I examine the intersection of gender and race in
   the effect of marriage. Analyzing data from the National Longitudinal
   Survey of Youth 1979, I find that the marriage wage premium grows
   steadily and at a similar pace among white and black men. The marriage
   wage premium declines toward negative among white women, yet it grows
   steadily among black women. Furthermore, measured work experience
   explains a substantial amount of the wage premium among black men, yet
   it has little explanatory power among white men, pointing to the
   importance of unobserved factors in white men's marriage premium.
   Changes in work experience negatively affect married white women's
   wages, yet they positively affect married black women's wages, pointing
   to the important differences between black and white families.

AB Racial attachments are understood to be socially constructed and
   endogenous to gender, socioeconomic, and religious identities. Yet we
   know surprisingly little about the effect of such identities on the
   particular racial labels that individuals self-select. In this article,
   I investigate how social identities shape the racial labels chosen by
   biracial individuals in the United States, a rapidly growing population
   who have multiple labeling options. Examining national surveys of more
   than 37,000 respondents of Latino-white, Asian-white, and black-white
   parentage, I disentangle how gender, socioeconomic status, and religious
   identity influence racial labeling decisions. Across biracial subgroups
   and net of all other influences, economic affluence and Jewish identity
   predict whiter self-identification, whereas belonging to a religion more
   commonly associated with racial minorities is associated with a minority
   identification. Gender, however, is the single best predictor of
   identification, with biracial women markedly more likely than biracial
   men to identify as multiracial. These findings help us better understand
   the contextual nature of racial identification and the processes via
   which social identities interact with racial meanings in the United
   States.

   technology (IT) workers to investigate the well-being effects of STAR,
   an organizational intervention designed to promote greater employee
   control over work time and greater supervisor support for workers'

   effects for the latter group, but over 12 months, STAR reduced burnout,

   satisfaction, for the early survey group. STAR effects are partially
   mediated by increases in schedule control and declines in family-to-work
   conflict and burnout (an outcome and mediator) by six months. Moderating
   effects show that STAR benefits women in reducing psychological distress
   and perceived stress, and increases non-supervisory employees' job
   satisfaction. This study demonstrates, with a rigorous design, that

AB Rebellious collective action is rare, but it can occur when subordinates
   are severely discontented and other circumstances are favorable. The
   possibility of rebellion is a checksometimes the only checkon
   authoritarian rule. Although mutinies in which crews seized control of
   their vessels were rare events, they occurred throughout the Age of
   Sail. To explain the occurrence of this form of high-risk collective
   action, this article holds that shipboard grievances were the principal
   cause of mutiny. However, not all grievances are equal in this respect.
   We distinguish between structural grievances that flow from incumbency
   in a subordinate social position and incidental grievances that
   incumbents have no expectation of suffering. Based on a case-control
   analysis of incidents of mutiny compared with controls drawn from a
   unique database of Royal Navy voyages from 1740 to 1820, in addition to
   a wealth of qualitative evidence, we find that mutiny was most likely to
   occur when structural grievances were combined with incidental ones.
   This finding has implications for understanding the causes of rebellion
   and the attainment of legitimate social order more generally.

AB This article addresses the question of whether and how internal wars can
   lead to state building. I offer a new conceptual framework for
   understanding the varied effects of internal conflict on state capacity,
   as measured through taxation. Contrary to the general scholarly
   consensus that internal wars make states fail, I hypothesize that like
   external wars, internal wars can lead to increased taxation when they
   enhance solidarity toward the state among the elite and motivate the
   state to strengthen and territorially expand the tax administration.
   Elite solidarity, in turn, depends on the degree to which elites
   perceive the risks of war as real, decide to protect their interests
   with the help of the state, and feel a sense of patriotism. However, due
   to the existence of insurgent actors with taxing capacity, the positive
   effect of internal wars on state building may be hampered. I use this
   framework to make sense of the cases of Colombia, Malaysia, and
   Singapore, where internal wars, despite their otherwise destructive
   effects, resulted in state building instead of state failure.

   that elected representatives are more likely to heed their constituents'

   influence on legislative behavior should be most apparent near elections
   and dependent on the partisan composition of the constituency. We
   capitalize on the incremental rollout of the conservative Fox News
   Channel in the late 1990s to evaluate our theoretical predictions. Fox
   News caused both Republicans and Democrats in Congress to increase
   support for the Republican Party position on divisive votes, but only in

AB The extent to which judicial outcomes depend on judges' identities is a
   central question in multiethnic societies. Past work on the impact of
   the racial composition of appellate courts has narrowly focused on civil
   rights cases in the United States. We expand this literature by testing
   for ethnicity-based panel effects in criminal appeals in Israel. Using
   randomness in the assignment of cases to panels, we find that appeal
   outcomes for Jewish defendants are independent of panels' ethnic
   composition. By contrast, panel composition is highly consequential for
   Arab defendants, who receive more lenient punishments when their case is
   heard by a panel that includes at least one Arab judge, compared to
   all-Jewish panels. The magnitude of these effects is sizable: a 14-20%
   reduction in incarceration and a 15-26% reduction in prison sentencing.
   These findings contribute to recent debates on the relationship between
   descriptive representation and substantive outcomes in judicial bodies.

AB This article examines the influence that rebel and state leaders have on
   civil war outcomes, arguing that incentives to avoid punishment
   influence their strategic decision making during war. Leaders in civil
   war face punishment from two sources: internal audiences and opponents.
   I hypothesize that leaders who bear responsibility for involvement in
   the war have a higher expectation of punishment from both sources
   following unfavorable war performance, and thus, have incentives to
   continue the fight in the hope of turning the tide and avoiding the
   negative consequences of defeat. These incentives, in turn, make leaders
   who bear responsibility more likely to fight to an extreme outcome and
   less likely to make concessions to end the war. These propositions are
   tested on an original data set identifying all rebel and state leaders
   in all civil conflict dyads ongoing between 1980 and 2011. Results
   support the hypothesized relationships between leader responsibility and
   war outcomes.

   to disentangle candidate effects from factors associated with the places
   from which candidates emerge. I reevaluate the links between candidate
   race, district composition, and turnout by leveraging a nationwide
   database of over 185 million individual registration records, including
   estimates for the race of every voter. Combining these records with
   detailed information about 3,000 recent congressional primary and
   general election candidates, I find that minority turnout is not higher
   in districts with minority candidates, after accounting for the relative
   size of the ethnic group within a district. Instead, Black and Latino
   citizens are more likely to vote in both primary and general elections
   as their share of the population increases, regardless of candidate
   race.

AB How does the context in which a person lives affect his or her political
   behavior? I exploit an event in which demographic context was
   exogenously changed, leading to a significant change in voters' behavior
   and demonstrating that voters react strongly to changes in an outgroup
   population. Between 2000 and 2004, the reconstruction of public housing
   in Chicago caused the displacement of over 25,000 African Americans,
   many of whom had previously lived in close proximity to white voters.
   After the removal of their African American neighbors, the white voters'
   turnout dropped by over 10 percentage points. Consistent with
   psychological theories of racial threat, their change in behavior was a
   function of the size and proximity of the outgroup population. Proximity
   was also related to increased voting for conservative candidates. These
   findings strongly suggest that racial threat occurs because of attitude
   change rather than selection.

   to a lower standard and sanction poor performers less often. A field
   experiment across 95 localities in Mali in which randomly assigned
   localities receive a civics course identifies the effect of raising
   voter expectations of government on their willingness to hold leaders
   accountable. The course provides information about local government
   capacity and responsibility as well as how local politicians perform
   relative to others, effectively raising voter expectations of what local
   governments can and should do. Survey experiments among individuals in
   treated and control communities (N = 5,560) suggest that people in
   treated villages are indeed more likely to sanction poor performers and
   vote based on performance more often. A behavioral outcomethe likelihood
   that villagers challenge local leaders at a town hall meetingadds

AB Citizens delegate the representation of their political preferences to

   interest groups seeking to influence their voting behavior. We argue
   that interest groups influence how MPs cast their vote in Parliament,
   but that this effect varies across groups. While lobbying by sectional
   groups provides incentives for MPs to defect from their constituents, we
   expect that cause groups in fact strengthen the link between MPs and
   their voters. We test our argument based on an innovative study of 118
   Swiss public referenda, which allows for directly comparing voter
   preferences with legislative voting of 448 MPs on these issues. Drawing
   on a multilevel regression analysis, this study shows that interest
   groups considerably affect the link between MPs and their voters. Our

AB Recent data collections about political violence are frequently based on
   media reports, which can lead to reporting bias. This is an issue in
   particular for the emergent literature on communication technology and
   conflict, since this technology may not only affect violence, but also
   the reporting about it. Using the effect of cellphones on violence as an
   example, this article presents a quantitative assessment of reporting
   bias in a micro-level analysis. Comparing media-based event reports and
   those from military sources, the results show that the purported
   violence-increasing effect of cellphone coverage is partly due to higher
   reporting rates of violence in cellphone-covered areas. A simple
   diagnostic procedure for this problem is implemented. Applied to the
   analysis of cellphones and violence in Africa, it produces a pattern
   that is consistent with reporting bias driving much of the effect found
   in the Pierskalla and Hollenbach (2013) study about this topic.

   voter preferences over the course of the election cycle. We then outline
   an empirical analysis relating support for parties or candidates in
   pre-election polls to their final vote. The analysis relies on over
   26,000 vote intention polls in 45 countries since 1942, covering 312
   discrete electoral cycles. Our results indicate that early polls contain
   substantial information about the final result but that they become
   increasingly informative over the election cycle. Although the degree to
   which this is true varies across countries in important and
   understandable ways given differences in political institutions, the
   pattern is strikingly general.

AB According to a growing tradition in International Relations, one way
   governments can credibly signal their intentions in foreign policy
   crises is by creating domestic audience costs: leaders can tie their
   hands by publicly threatening to use force since domestic publics punish
   leaders who say one thing and do another. We argue here that there are
   actually two logics of audience costs: audiences can punish leaders both
   for being inconsistent (the traditional audience cost), and for
   threatening to use force in the first place (a belligerence cost). We
   employ an experiment that disentangles these two rationales, and turn to
   a series of dispositional characteristics from political psychology to
   bring the audience into audience cost theory. Our results suggest that
   traditional audience cost experiments may overestimate how much people
   care about inconsistency, and that the logic of audience costs (and the
   implications for crisis bargaining) varies considerably with the
   leader's constituency.

   What is less well understood is that conventional estimation practices
   for observational studies may produce the same problem even with a
   representative sample. Causal effects estimated via multiple regression
   differentially weight each unit's contribution. The effective sample
   that regression uses to generate the estimate may bear little
   resemblance to the population of interest, and the results may be
   nonrepresentative in a manner similar to what quasi-experimental methods
   or experiments with convenience samples produce. There is no general
   external validity basis for preferring multiple regression on
   representative samples over quasi-experimental or experimental methods.
   We show how to estimate the multiple regression weights that allow one
   to study the effective sample. We discuss alternative approaches that,

   While our theories about competition emphasize trade-offs across

   considering trade-offs between one category and everything else. We
   propose a research strategy for testing theories about trade-off
   relationships that shape dynamic compositional variables. This approach
   improves current methods used to analyze compositional dependent
   variables by addressing two limitations. First, although scholars have
   considered compositional dependent variables, they have done so in
   contexts that were not dynamic. Second, current approaches toward
   graphical presentations become unwieldy when the compositional dependent
   variable has more than three categories. We demonstrate the utility of
   our strategy to expand current theories of party support and political
   budgeting. In both cases, we can extend trade-offs across pairs of
   alternatives (e.g., prime minister versus all other parties or spending
   on defense versus everything else) to competition across multiple
   alternatives.

AB This article theoretically and empirically analyses behaviour in penny
   auctions, a relatively new auction mechanism. As in the US dollars or
   war-of-attrition, players in penny auctions commit higher non-refundable
   costs as the auction continues and only win if all other players stop
   bidding. I first show that, in any equilibria that does not end
   immediately, players bid probabilistically such that the expected profit
   from every bid is zero. Then, using two large data sets covering 166,000
   auctions, I calculate that average profit margins actually exceed 50%.
   To explain this deviation, I incorporate a sunk-cost fallacy into the
   theoretical model to generate a set of predictions about hazard rates
   and player behaviour, which I confirm empirically. While players do
   (slowly) learn to correct this bias and there are few obvious barriers
   to competition, activity in the market is rising and concentration
   remains relatively high.

   community of radical environmental activists make affirming moral
   identities centered on living "naturally" seem like "second nature,"
   even in a seemingly unnatural and immoral urban environment, by
   reconfiguring their physical world. The author shows how nonhuman

AB School racial composition has modest effects on test score gaps, but

   that blacks who attend schools with higher proportions of white

   national longitudinal surveys reveal no effects of high school racial
   composition on occupational status, employment, or annual earnings for
   blacks or whites. For other minority groups, attending schools with more
   whites impedes occupational advancement. For all groups, however, school
   racial composition predicts workplace racial composition: Whites who
   attend high schools with higher proportions of white students have
   higher proportions of white coworkers, while nonwhites who attend
   schools with higher proportions of whites have fewer same-race
   coworkers. The findings are modest in size but robust to alternative
   specifications, and sensitivity analyses support a causal interpretation
   for same-race coworkers. These results support perpetuation theory for

   Immigrant homophily disproportionately increases as immigrants see more
   same-ethnic peers, and friendship density among natives has no effect on
   this. By contrast, native homophily remains relatively low until natives
   see dense groups of immigrants. The authors' results suggest that
   theories of interethnic competition and contact opportunities apply
   differently to ethnic majority and minority groups.

   does not need both: if credit is easy, money is irrelevant; if credit is
   tight, money is essential, but credit becomes irrelevant. Changes in
   credit conditions are neutral because real balances respond endogenously
   to keep total liquidity constant. This is true for both exogenous and
   endogenous debt limits and policy limits, secured and unsecured lending,
   and general pricing mechanisms. While we show how to overturn some of
   these results, the benchmark model suggests credit might matter less

   Markets are defined by a price and a procedure for clearing trades, and
   any asset can, in principle, be traded in any market. Buyers can use
   their information to impose acceptance rules which specify which assets
   they are willing to trade in each market. The set of markets where trade
   takes place is derived endogenously. The model can be applied to find
   conditions under which these economies feature fire sales, contagion,

AB We provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of the link between
   financial and real health care markets. This link is important as
   financial returns drive investment in medical research and development
   (R&D), which, in turn, affects real spending growth. We document a
   medical innovation premium of 4-6% annually for equity returns of firms
   in the health care sector. We interpret this premium as compensating
   investors for government-induced profit risk, and we provide supportive
   evidence for this hypothesis through company filings and abnormal return
   patterns surrounding threats of government intervention. We quantify the
   implications of the premium for the growth in real health care spending
   by calibrating our model to match historical trends, predicting the
   share of gross domestic product (GDP) devoted to health care to be 32%
   in the long run. Policies that had removed government risk would have
   led to more than a doubling of medical R&D and would have increased the
   current share of health care spending by more than 3% of GDP.

AB This paper investigates relational incentive contracts with continuous,
   privately observed agent types that are persistent over time. With fixed
   agent types, full separation is not possible when continuation
   equilibrium payoffs following revelation are on the Pareto frontier of
   attainable payoffs. This result is related to the ratchet effect in
   that: (1) a type imitating a less productive type receives an
   information rent, and (2) with full separation, one imitating a more
   productive type receives the same future payoff as that more productive
   type. However, the reason for (2) is fundamentally different than with
   the ratchet effect. It arises from the dynamic enforcement requirement
   in relational contracts, not from the principal having all the
   bargaining power, and applies whatever the distribution between
   principal and agent of the future gains from the relationship (i.e.,
   whatever the point on the Pareto frontier). This result extends to
   sufficiently persistent types under certain conditions.

AB Most countries have automatic rules in their tax-and-transfer systems
   that are partly intended to stabilize economic fluctuations. This paper
   measures their effect on the dynamics of the business cycle. We put
   forward a model that merges the standard incomplete-markets model of
   consumption and inequality with the new Keynesian model of nominal
   rigidities and business cycles, and that includes most of the main
   potential stabilizers in the U.S. data and the theoretical channels by
   which they may work. We find that the conventional argument that
   stabilizing disposable income will stabilize aggregate demand plays a
   negligible role in the dynamics of the business cycle, whereas
   tax-and-transfer programs that affect inequality and social insurance
   can have a larger effect on aggregate volatility. However, as currently
   designed, the set of stabilizers in place in the United States has had
   little effect on the volatility of aggregate output fluctuations or on
   their welfare costs despite stabilizing aggregate consumption. The
   stabilizers have a more important role when monetary policy is
   constrained by the zero lower bound, and they affect welfare
   significantly through the provision of social insurance.

AB This paper considers equilibrium quit turnover in a frictional labor
   market with costly hiring by firms, where large firms employ many
   workers and face both aggregate and firm specific productivity shocks.
   There is exogenous firm turnover as new (small) startups enter the
   market over time, while some existing firms fail and exit. Individual
   firm growth rates are disperse and evolve stochastically. The paper
   highlights how dynamic monopsony, where firms trade off lower wages
   against higher (endogenous) employee quit rates, yields excessive
   job-to-job quits. Such quits directly crowd out the reemployment
   prospects of the unemployed. With finite firm productivity states,
   stochastic equilibrium is fully tractable and can be computed using
   standard numerical techniques.

AB We revisit the comparison of mathematical programming with equilibrium
   constraints (MPEC) and nested fixed point (NFXP) algorithms for
   estimating structural dynamic models by Su and Judd (2012). Their
   implementation of the nested fixed point algorithm used successive
   approximations to solve the inner fixed point problem (NFXP-SA). We redo
   their comparison using the more efficient version of NFXP proposed by
   Rust (1987), which combines successive approximations and
   Newton-Kantorovich iterations to solve the fixed point problem
   (NFXP-NK). We show that MPEC and NFXP are similar in speed and numerical
   performance when the more efficient NFXP-NK variant is used.

AB Obstruction is a time-honored tradition in legislative politics. In many
   cases, obstruction can be foreseen to be ultimately unsuccessful, and in
   some of these cases, purely costly even to the obstructor. In this
   article, I construct a model of obstruction in which the individual
   obstruction of a fait accompli policy proposal is potentially
   informative precisely and ironically because it is inefficient. The
   theory, based on the legislators' reelection motivations, offers
   comparative static predictions about the frequency and length of
   obstruction as a function of the individual characteristics of the
   legislator and his or her electoral setting, including the legislator's
   value for reelection, the appeal of the legislator's challenger, the
   legislator's individual-specific seniority, competence, and/or valence,
   and the visibility of the legislator's obstruction efforts to the voter.
   Finally, the theory illustrates the potential for transparency of
   legislators' individual actions to be strictly welfare reducing, even in
   the absence of pandering.

AB What happens to partisanship when a party undergoes rapid and visible
   elite-led changes that dilute its traditional brand? We address
   scholarly debates on the stability of mass partisanship by analyzing the
   consequences of the major brand change (marked by policy moderation and
   scandal) experienced by the leftist Brazilian Workers Party (PT) between
   2002 and 2006. Analyzing a survey panel with interviews spanning this
   period, we find that many Brazilian citizens alternated between petismo
   and independence but rarely crossed party lines. They switched, we
   demonstrate, in response to political events. While the PT's brand
   dilution drove away some traditional petistas, we observe two other
   dynamics: the rise of a new brand associated with the successful
   incumbent president (Lula) attracted new adherents, and amid this
   instability, a core of petistas stood by their party. Our findings
   suggest that scholarship on partisanship has established a false
   dichotomy between stability and instability.

AB Why do governments manipulate elections at varying levels? This paper
   argues that variation in electoral manipulation can in part be explained
   by the fundamental trade-off between an incumbent's desire to signal his
   popularity and his risk of losing elections. Incumbents with a secure
   office do not need to convince the opposition of their wide support and
   avoid electoral risks by manipulating elections. Insecure incumbents,
   however, want to generate a strong signal of their popularity and adopt
   a riskier strategy of electoral uncertainty. Measuring office insecurity
   through the incidence of economic crises, coup threats, and protests, I
   document robust evidence supporting this proposition in a panel of
   autocracies and transitional democracies using a variety of measures and
   statistical designs. Politically insecure incumbents are more likely to
   hold elections, to tolerate electoral competition, and ultimately to
   lose in the very competition they permit.

AB Treatments of Aristotle's moral-political science have largely
   disregarded the methodological statements that he delivers as he embarks
   on his philosophy of human affairs in book I of the Nicomachean Ethics.
   A consideration of these statements, however, lends critical support to
   the view that Aristotle sought to give the sharpest possible expression
   to ordinary moral-political opinion. Moreover, apart from revealing the
   by-no-means ordinary reasons that induced Aristotle to do so (and to do
   so in contrast to Plato), such a consideration sheds light on the source
   of the vagueness or ambiguity that defines moral-political opinion as
   such. Indeed, the methodological statements are perhaps the first
   entries in the old quarrel of relevance versus rigor. And, through them,
   Aristotle suggests how political scientists today might walk a fine line
   between politics, on one hand, and science, on the other, without losing
   sight of the ultimate tension between them.

   systematically manipulated? After establishing discrepancies in economic
   data series cross-nationally, this article examines Chinese sub-national
   growth data. It leverages variation in the likelihood of manipulation
   over two dimensions, arguing that politically sensitive data are more
   likely to be manipulated at politically sensitive times. Gross domestic
   product (GDP) releases generate headlines, while highly correlated
   electricity production and consumption data are relatively unnoticed. In
   Chinese provinces, the difference between GDP and electricity growth
   increases in years with leadership turnover, which is consistent with
   juking the stats for political reasons. The analysis points to the
   political role of information and the limits of non-electoral
   accountability mechanisms in authoritarian regimes.

AB Government formation in multiparty systems is of self-evident
   substantive importance, and the subject of an enormous theoretical
   literature. Empirical evaluations of models of government formation tend
   to separate government formation per se from the distribution of key
   government pay-offs, such as cabinet portfolios, between members of the
   resulting government. Models of government formation are necessarily
   specified ex ante, absent any knowledge of the government that forms.
   Models of the distribution of cabinet portfolios are typically, though
   not necessarily, specified ex post, taking into account knowledge of the
   identity of some government 'formateur' or even of the composition of
   the eventual cabinet. This disjunction lies at the heart of a notorious
   contradiction between predictions of the distribution of cabinet
   portfolios made by canonical models of legislative bargaining and the
   robust empirical regularity of proportional portfolio allocations -
   Gamson's Law. This article resolves this contradiction by specifying and
   estimating a joint model of cabinet formation and portfolio distribution
   that, for example, predicts ex ante which parties will receive zero
   portfolios rather than taking this as given ex post. It concludes that
   canonical models of legislative bargaining do increase the ability to
   predict government membership, but that portfolio distribution between
   government members conforms robustly to a proportionality norm because
   portfolio distribution follows the much more difficult process of policy
   bargaining in the typical government formation process.

AB Tax competition is the quintessential example of policy interdependence.
   The general idea is that tax changes in one jurisdiction lead to similar
   changes in others. However, research has shown that institutional and
   political constraints limit competition. This article develops another
   argument: that socialization among policy makers attenuates competitive
   dynamics by setting limits to the extent of competition that is
   considered acceptable. Using fine-grained Swiss data and spatial
   econometric techniques, it shows that personal income tax rates are more
   strongly correlated among competitors that do not participate in the
   same intergovernmental organizations. This finding implies that, to some
   extent, the detrimental consequences of competition can be mitigated by
   fostering institutionalized forms of interaction among policy makers.

   fail to support hypotheses that corruption is an undifferentiated

   corruption, and support the hypothesis that the importance of each
   channel depends on the salience of each source of corruption and that
   pocketbook corruption voting prevails unless a credible anti-corruption
   party shifts media coverage of corruption and activates sociotropic
   corruption voting. Previous studies may have underestimated the

   suggests that the impact of trade on aggregate preferences will depend
   on citizens' exposure to trade. It hypothesizes that employees of
   import-competing, export-oriented and multinational firms will adopt a
   'compensatory' model in which higher levels of imports (exports) lead to
   a liberal (conservative) shift in policy preferences for more (less)
   government. It distinguishes between intrafirm and non-intrafirm trade
   flows. It measures policy mood using Stimson's 'Mood', and estimates
   Error Correction and Instrumental Variable models. Trade flows strongly
   influence Mood in a manner consistent with hypotheses drawn from
   international political economy and heterogeneous firms (or 'new new')

   when another group is perceived to violate group entitlements - by

AB Voluntary compliance is an important aspect of strong tax regimes, but
   there is limited understanding of how social norms favoring compliance
   emerge. Using novel data from urban Nigeria, where tax enforcement is
   weak, this article shows that individuals with a positive experience of
   state services delivery are more likely to express belief in an
   unconditioned citizen obligation to pay tax. In addition to support for
   this fiscal exchange mechanism, social context is consequential. Where
   individuals have access to community-provided goods, which may
   substitute for effective state services provision, they are less likely
   to adopt pro-compliance norms. Finally, the article shows that norm
   adoption increases tax payment. These findings have broad implications

AB The ability of the news media to mobilize voters during an election
   campaign is not well understood. Most extant research has been conducted
   in single-country studies and has paid little or no attention to the
   contextual level and the conditions under which such effects are more or
   less likely to occur. This study tests the mobilizing effect of conflict
   news framing in the context of the 2009 European Parliamentary
   elections. The unique multi-method and comparative cross-national study
   design combines a media content analysis (N548,982) with data from a
   two-wave panel survey conducted in twenty-one countries (N532,411).
   Consistent with expectations, conflict framing in campaign news
   mobilized voters to vote. Since the effect of conflict news was
   moderated by evaluations of the EU polity in the general information
   environment, conflict framing more effectively mobilized voters in
   countries where the EU was evaluated more positively.

AB High rerunning rates among incumbents and among the two major parties
   allow studies of U.S. incumbency advantage to bypass the selection
   problem of who chooses to rerun. In countries where rerunning is not
   widespread among individuals or parties, estimation using methods
   developed for the United States may result in a sample selection bias.
   In countries with party switching, there may be a disconnect between
   party and individual estimates. This article proposes a definition of
   incumbency advantage that is valid for countries that present any of
   these characteristics and that is valid for cross-country comparison:
   the effect of incumbency for an individual politician on the
   unconditional probability of winning. I illustrate the issues raised in
   this article with evidence from Brazilian mayoral elections.

AB We draw on structured and qualitative data to examine relationship
   dynamics associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) that occurs
   during the young adult period. Relying on a symbolic interactionist
   perspective, we identify specific contested domains associated with what
   has been called "situational couple violence," and explore the degree to
   which certain forms of communication about contested areas ("verbal
   amplifiers") exacerbate the risk of violence. Consistent with this
   relational focus, measures index respondent as well as partner concerns
   and use of these negative forms of communication. Results of analyses of
   interview data from a large, diverse sample of young adults show that
   net of family background, history of antisocial behavior, and other
   controls, concerns about the partner's or individual's own economic
   viability, disagreements about time spent with friends, and issues of
   infidelity are significantly related to IPV perpetration. Yet, the
   analyses indicate that infidelity is particularly central as a source of
   conflict associated with violence, and the use of verbal amplifiers
   explained additional variance. Further, while research has highlighted
   important differences in the meaning and consequences of male and female
   IPV, findings point to some areas of overlap in the relationship
   concerns and communication processes associated with variations in
   self-reports of the use of violence. In-depth "relationship history
   narratives" elicited from a subset of respondents and a sample of their
   partners support the quantitative results, but also highlight variations
   within the sample, the sequencing of these interrelated processes, and
   ways in which gender may have influenced respondents' perspectives and
   behavior.

   Canadian provinces, we find evidence that aggregate immigration
   mitigates the increase in the size of the non-tradable sector in booming
   regions. The mitigation effect is due mostly to interprovincial
   migration and temporary foreign workers. There is no evidence of such an
   effect for permanent international immigration. Interprovincial
   migration also results in a spreading effect of Dutch disease from
   booming to non-booming provinces.

   variously related young adult siblings (MZ twins, DZ twins, full
   siblings, half siblings, cousins, and nonrelated siblings) to
   distinguish the roles of genetic and environmental influences on
   educational attainment. Using quantitative genetic (ACE) models, we find
   that the role of genes in educational attainment is relatively weaker
   (23 percent of the variance) and the role of the shared family
   environment stronger (41 percent of the variance for twins and 30
   percent of the variance for non-twin siblings) than is typically found
   for cognitive outcomes in young adults. The pattern of high shared
   environmentality, especially for twins, is not accounted for by the
   strong degree of assortative mating in the data (parental correlation r
   = .629), nor by direct effects of educational attainment of the siblings
   on each other. The low heritability-high environmentality pattern
   indicates a high level of inequality of opportunity for educational
   attainment in American society at the turn of the twenty-first century,
   perhaps linked to a greater role of family financial resources in
   attainment. Comparative evidence suggests that inequality of opportunity
   has increased in the United States over past decades, and is higher
   there today than in other industrial societies.

   individual-level measures to proxy family socioeconomic status, we use a
   direct measure of family living standards for both generations, based on
   an index of economic well-being. Strong intergenerational persistence is
   found in Mexico compared to other countries. Persistence is stronger for
   men than women, particularly among advantaged families. The role of
   education in the mobility process is examined. Findings indicate that
   "excess immobility" of men is not mediated by education. Wider gender
   differences among married/cohabiting than single respondents suggests
   parents are more likely to transfer socioeconomic resources to their
   married sons than married daughters. We argue for the advantages of
   measuring socioeconomic status directly at the household level, and of
   evaluating gender differences to gain insight about mobility mechanisms.

AB Recent research shows that student loans may affect persistence and

   between debt and everyday college experiences. We use data from the
   National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen to assess the relationship
   between student loan debt and the foundation of campus life-time use. On
   a basic level, we find that debt is related to students' time spent on
   activities such as working for pay, consuming media, and athletics. We
   then focus on results from a latent class analysis, which suggest that
   college activities coalesce into three distinct student lifestyles that
   are differentially associated with debt. Although many debt-free
   students develop active non-academic agendas in the "Socially Engaged"
   lifestyle, indebted students may exhibit one of two divergent types: the
   "Serious Students," who spend their time on academics and working for
   pay, or the "Inactive," who are comparatively uninvolved in campus life.
   These patterns suggest that either student loan debt is a stratifying
   mechanism for students' college experiences, or that it acts as a proxy
   for students' selection into particular time use patterns.

AB Despite a growing empirical literature on the relationship between

   address longer-run outcomes. Using Norwegian registry data, this study
   addresses the causal impact of immigrant classmates on educational
   attainment in young adulthood, as well as academic track enrollment and
   educational achievement in school, within six entire student cohorts in
   their final tenth grade of compulsory education (310,742 students, 751
   schools). Controlling for school fixed effects, native peer
   characteristics, and observed characteristics of students and their
   families, we find that students in cohorts with more immigrant peers
   within the same school have slightly higher propensities to complete
   upper-secondary education by their early twenties. The effects are about
   three times stronger among students from immigrant families compared to
   students with native-born parents, and are also robust to adjustment for
   average grade achievement. Moreover, these peer effects seem to mainly
   reflect the presence of immigrant classmates from high-achieving origin
   regions, while we do not find corresponding negative effects of exposure
   to immigrant classmates from low-achieving origin regions. In
   conclusion, these results indicate a modest positive influence of
   exposure to immigrant classmates on, primarily, immigrant students'
   educational attainment several years later.

   political ideology and public perceptions of science in the current

   culturally and politically divided in its support for the intersection
   of science and the state. Various models of political and cultural
   polarization are tested. Overall, ideological challenges to the cultural
   authority of science cannot be reduced to left-right political
   polarization or to conservative religious beliefs. Instead, skepticism
   on the political right is multifold, involving distinct modes of thought
   and concerns about the institutional ties between science and the state.

AB Decades of social science research demonstrate the impact of education
   on civic participation. However, prior scholarship generally assumes
   that the returns to education do not change over time or geographic

   individuals obtain a college degree, there are a greater number of
   qualified individuals competing for the same social resources. The
   present study tests the impact of education on civic participation, and
   whether this effect changes as the number of college-educated
   individuals increases over birth cohorts. The present findings suggest
   that in some cases, a college degree's impact on civic participation
   declines as more individuals obtain college degrees. The findings
   challenge commonly held assumptions about the effect of higher education
   on civic participation. Furthermore, the findings suggest that while
   sending an individual to college may increase civic participation,
   encouraging all high school students to go to college may undercut the
   benefits of college attendance.

   demography of grandparenthood in contemporary societies: First, at what
   age do people become grandparents? Second, how is grandparenthood
   sequenced with other transitions in later life? Third, how long is the
   grandparent life stage? To answer these questions, we analyzed
   retrospective data from the United States (NSFH) and 24 European
   countries (GGS, ESS, DEAS). Using survival methods, we estimated (1) age
   at grandparenthood; (2) demographic overlap with parenting, worker, and
   filial roles; and (3) expected length of the grandparent life stage.
   Three central findings emerged from the analysis: First, the timing of
   grandparenthood varies strongly across countries. Cross-national
   differences in the median age at grandparenthood are larger than in age
   at parenthood, age at retirement, and life expectancy. Compared to the
   United States (49 years among women, 52 years among men),
   grandparenthood in Eastern Europe occurs up to three years earlier in
   life; in Western Europe, up to eight years later. Second, cross-national
   variation in the life-course context of grandparenthood is less
   pronounced. In all countries, grandparenthood overlaps rarely with
   active parenting but frequently with worker and filial roles. Third, the
   length of the grandparent life stage is more strongly influenced by the
   timing of fertility than by the timing of mortality. The longest years
   of life shared with grandchildren (35 years) are expected among
   grandmothers in East Germany and the United States; the shortest (21
   years) among grandfathers in West Germany and Spain.

   childrearing is associated with relationship dissolution. We use
   longitudinal survey and time-diary data on young children from the
   Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC; n = 5,604). We
   investigate mothers' and fathers' parenting time, alone and with each
   other, in a wide variety of activities. Controlling for a rich set of
   demographic characteristics and the quality of the parental
   relationship, we find that the sole correlate of parental relationship
   dissolution is shared time spent in family meals. This correlation holds
   only for shared family mealtime in which families are not simultaneously
   watching television. Further analysis suggests that high-quality shared
   family mealtimes may lower the risk of relationship dissolution by
   enhancing mothers' perceptions of marital quality and relationship
   happiness and reducing maternal depressive symptoms.

AB This paper seeks a more comprehensive explanation of wrongdoing in
   organizations by theorizing two underexplored causes of wrongdoing
   related to an organizational participant's embeddedness in formal
   organizational structures and informal peer relationships: the
   criticality of a person's role in their organization's division of
   labor, and their social ties to deviant peers within their organization
   and industry who vary with respect to their experience with social
   control agents. We investigate how these factors influenced wrongdoing
   in the context of professional cyclists' use of banned performance-
   enhancing drugs (PEDs) in advance of the 2010 Tour de France. This
   empirical setting provides two advantages: it permits evaluation of a
   wider range of potential determinants of wrongdoing than is
   conventionally possible, and it allows for the use of a measure of
   wrongdoing that is not subject to the type of bias that plagues most
   previously used indicators. We find substantial support for our
   prediction that actors who perform critical organizational roles are
   more likely to engage in wrongdoing. Further, we find that while
   undifferentiated social ties to known wrongdoers did not increase the
   likelihood of wrongdoing, ties to unpunished offenders increased the
   probability of wrongdoing and ties to severely punished offenders
   decreased it. These effects were robust to consideration of other known
   causes of wrongdoing in organizations: weak governance regimes and
   permissive cultural contexts, performance strain, and individual
   propensities to engage in wrongdoing.

AB A large literature has linked the in utero environment to health in
   adulthood. We consider how prenatal nutrition may shape human capital
   acquisition in childhood, utilising the month-long Ramadan fast as a
   natural experiment. In student register data for Pakistani and
   Bangladeshi families in England, we examine whether Ramadan's overlap
   with pregnancy affects subsequent academic outcomes at age 7. We find
   that test scores are 0.05-0.08 standard deviations lower for students
   exposed to Ramadan in early pregnancy. Our results suggest that brief
   prenatal investments may be more cost effective than traditional
   educational interventions in improving academic performance.

AB This article provides a critique of the concept of reflexivity in social
   theory today and argues against the tendency to define agency
   exclusively in terms of reflexivity. Margaret Archer, in particular, is
   highlighted as a key proponent of this thesis. Archer argues that late
   modernity is characterized by reflexivity but, in our view, this
   position neglects the impact of more enduring aspects of agency, such as
   the routinization of social life and the role of the taken-for-granted.
   These concepts were pivotal to Bourdieu and Giddens' theorization of
   everyday life and action and to Foucault's understanding of technologies
   of the self. We offer Bourdieu's habitus as a more nuanced approach to
   theorizing agency, and provide an alternative account of reflexivity.
   Whilst accepting that reflexivity is a core aspect of agency, we argue
   that it operates to a backdrop of the routinization of social life and
   operates from within and not outside of habitus. We highlight the role
   of the breach in reflexivity, suggesting that it opens up a critical
   window for agents to initiate change. The article suggests caution in
   over-ascribing reflexivity to agency, instead arguing that achieving
   reflexivity and change is a difficult and fraught process, which has
   emotional and moral consequences. The effect of this is that people
   often prefer the status quo, rather than to risk change and uncertainty.

AB Those students who were among the first sociology graduates in the UK
   barely feature in standard histories of the discipline, which all have
   an intellectual and institutional focus. This article remedies this
   neglect by researching the social backgrounds and later careers of
   sociology graduates from the London School of Economics and Political
   Science [ LSE] and Bedford College for Women from the first such
   graduate in 1907 until those graduating in the 1930s. Data for this
   exercise were compiled from a variety of sources. The more important
   are: UK censuses, especially that of 1911; various civil registration
   records; archived student files; and, for the graduates who entered
   university teaching, issues of the Yearbook of the Universities of the
   Empire [ later the Commonwealth Universities' Yearbook]. The dataset
   includes all identified graduates in the BSc(Econ), Special Subject
   Sociology, degree from 1907 to 1935 and all in the BA (Honours) in
   Sociology degree from 1925 to 1939. LSE sociology graduates tended to be
   older and to have more cosmopolitan backgrounds, with fathers more
   likely than for Bedford College graduates to come from commercial rather
   than professional backgrounds. Both institutions' graduates' careers
   tended to the Civil Service and local government. LSE graduates
   gravitated to education, especially to higher education if male, whilst
   those of Bedford College went into welfare work, countering a stereotype
   from some previous literature that especially women graduates were
   heavily constrained to follow careers in schoolteaching. The article
   also gives comparisons with the social-class profile and career
   destinations of several cohorts of postwar sociology graduates, noting a
   number of similarities.

AB T.H. Marshall in his famous tract Citizenship and Social Class wrote
   briefly about what he called 'industrial citizenship', a type of
   belonging rooted in the workplace. Here Marshall's ideas are developed
   alongside a consideration of Durkheim's Professional Ethics and Civic
   Morals together with research material from the Guinness Company. It
   shows the way the Company actively sought to create 'Guinness
   citizenship' within its London brewery. The article draws out the ways
   in which the significance and potential of work based citizenship for
   ameliorating the ills of industrial society are clearly articulated in
   mid-twentieth century Britain and echo earlier neglected Durkheimian
   sociological ideas on work. These ideas have real potential to inform
   contemporary academic and policy debates about the nature of capitalism
   and the form and content of work now and in the future.

   neglect of the working class
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY

BP 691
EP 717
DI 10.1111/1468-4446.12160

PY 2015
AB The paper was stimulated by the relative absence of the working class
   from work-life debates. The common conclusion from work-life studies is
   that work-life imbalance is largely a middle-class problem. It is argued
   here that this classed assertion is a direct outcome of a particular and
   narrow interpretation of work-life imbalance in which time is seen to be
   the major cause of difficulty. Labour market time, and too much of it,
   dominates the conceptualization of work-life and its measurement too.
   This heavy focus on too much labour market time has rendered largely
   invisible from dominant work-life discourses the types of imbalance that
   are more likely to impact the working class. The paper's analysis of
   large UK data-sets demonstrates a reduction in hours worked by
   working-class men, more part-time employment in working-class
   occupations, and a substantial growth in levels of reported financial
   insecurity amongst the working classes after the 2008-9 recession. It
   shows too that economic-based work-life imbalance is associated with
   lower levels of life satisfaction than is temporal imbalance. The paper
   concludes that the dominant conceptualization of work-life disregards
   the major work-life challenge experienced by the working class: economic
   precarity. The work-life balance debate needs to more fully incorporate
   economic-based work-life imbalance if it is to better represent class
   inequalities.

AB Ranciere published two substantial criticisms of the work of Bourdieu in
   the early 1980s. It is possible that these were provoked by his sense
   that he needed to oppose what he considered to be the sociological
   reduction of aesthetic taste offered by Bourdieu in Distinction
   (Bourdieu 1986 [ 1979]) at precisely the moment when he (Ranciere) was
   beginning to articulate his commitment to the potential of aesthetic
   expression as a mode of political resistance. Except in so far as it
   draws upon some of the retrospective reflections offered by Ranciere in
   his introductions to the re-issues of his early texts, this paper
   examines the parallel development of the thinking of the two men up to
   the mid-1980s - but not beyond. The discussion is situated
   socio-historically and, by definition, does not seek to offer
   comparatively any transhistorical assessment of the values of the
   positions adopted by the two men. I argue that Ranciere misrepresented
   the character of Bourdieu's sociological work by failing to recognize
   the underlying phenomenological orientation of his thinking. Bourdieu
   suppressed this orientation in the 1960s but, after the May events of
   1968, it enabled him to expose the extent to which the practices of both
   science and art operate within constructed 'fields' in strategic
   distinction from popular primary experience. The challenge is to
   introduce an ongoing dialogue between primary and constructed cultures
   rather than to suppose that either social science or art possesses
   intrinsic autonomy.

AB This article draws on analysis of data generated by way of an
   ethnography of fell running in the English Lake District and suggests
   that participants who have lived and run in the area for many years
   experience a particular mode of aesthetic. The Lake District has long
   been valued for its outstanding scenery represented in the aesthetic of
   the picturesque comprising relatively static landscapes that should be
   conserved. Established fell runners who have run in the area for many
   decades apprehend and appreciate the landscape in more complex, rooted
   and situated ways. The anthropologist Ingold, distinguishes between
   landscape and landsceppan, and this insight is instructive for grasping
   the way in which the runners do not simply scope scenery but work with
   the land: they shape it and are shaped by it. Fell runners are elements
   within the living environment and along with walls, sheep, becks, sun,
   rain -what Ingold evocatively calls the 'weather-world' - are mobile.
   Movement is central to their aesthetic, they enjoy not so much the
   scenic but rather a fellsceppan and do so through their fast
   eye-gait-footwork and their lively, variable occupation with the
   terrain. The fells infiltrate and interpenetrate the runners and
   movement through the fells generates a somatic aesthetic. The pleasure
   in turn breeds existential capital an embodied gratification that serves
   as an attractor that binds those who appreciate feelings of being alive
   with and in the fells.

AB The scholarship on aesthetics and materiality has studied how objects
   help shape identity, social action and subjectivity. Objects, as
   'equipment[s] for living' (Luhmann 2000), become the 'obligatory passage
   points humans have to contend with in order to pursue their projects
   (Latour 1991). They provide patterns to which bodies can unconsciously
   latch onto, or help human agents work towards particular states of being
   (DeNora 2000, 2003). Objects are central in the long term process of
   taste construction, as any attachment to an object is made out of a
   delicate equilibrium of mediators, bodies, situations and techniques
   (Hennion and his collaborators (Hennion and Fouquet 2001; Hennion and
   Gomart 1999). In all of these accounts objects are the end result of
   long-term processes of stabilization, in which the actual material
   object (a musical piece, a sculpture, an art installation, a glass of
   wine, the oeuvre of Bach as we know it) is both a result and yet a key
   co-producer of its own generation. Whereas the literature has been
   generous and detailed in exploring the processes of assembling and
   sustaining object-centered attachments, it has not sufficiently engaged
   with what happens when the aesthetic elements of cultural artifacts that
   have produced emotional resonance are transformed: what do these
   artifacts morph into? What explains the transition (or not) of different
   cultural objects? And relatedly, what happens to the key aesthetic
   qualities that were so central to how the objects had been defined, and
   to those who have emotionally attached to them? To answer these
   questions, this article uses as exemplars two different cases of
   attachment, predicated on the distinctive features of a cultural object
   -the transcendence of opera and the authenticity of a soccer jersey -
   that have undergone transformations.

AB Recent research suggests that participation in organized extracurricular
   activities by children and adolescents can have educational and
   occupational payoffs. This research also establishes that participation
   is strongly associated with social class. However, debate has
   ensued-primarily among qualitative researchers-over whether the
   association between class and activities stems exclusively from
   inequalities in objective resources and constraints or whether differing
   cultural orientations have a role. We address this debate using a
   nationally representative sample of children's time diaries, merged with
   extensive information on their families, to model participation in, and
   expenditures on, organized activities. While we cannot directly observe
   cultural orientations, we account for a substantially wider array of
   resources and constraints than previous studies. We find that, above and
   beyond these factors, maternal education has a consistently large effect
   on the outcomes we study. We discuss the plausibility of a cultural
   interpretation of this result, as well as alternative interpretations.

AB It is widely believed that countries with greater levels of income
   inequality also have lower levels of intergenerational mobility. This
   relationship, known as the Great Gatsby Curve (GGC), has been
   prominently cited by high-ranking public policymakers, bestselling
   authors, and Nobel Prize-winning academics. Yet, relatively little
   cross-national work has empirically examined the mechanisms thought to
   underpin the GGC-particularly with regard to the role of educational
   attainment. This paper uses the cross-nationally comparable Programme
   for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data set to
   shed new light on this issue. We find that income inequality is
   associated with several key components of the intergenerational
   transmission process-including access to higher education, the financial
   returns on education, and the residual effect of parental education upon
   labor-market earnings. Thus, consistent with theoretical models, we find
   that educational attainment is an important driver of the relationship
   between intergenerational mobility and income inequality. We hence
   conclude that unequal access to financial resources plays a central role
   in the intergenerational transmission of advantage.

AB The accommodation of Muslim minorities in European countries has sparked
   controversies over the extension of religious rights. Previous research
   has mostly studied public institutions and debates. But which attitudes
   toward religious rights do Europeans hold and how can we explain these
   attitudes? To approach this question, we draw on the novel EURISLAM data
   set, which allows us for the first time to investigate attitudes of both
   Muslim minorities and Christian natives in six Western European
   countries. To explain attitudes, we test the explanatory power of
   religiosity at the individual level and state-church regimes in both
   destination and origin countries at the macro level. Overall, Muslims,
   especially religious Muslims, are more supportive of religious rights
   than natives. However, we also find that religious natives approve to a
   greater extent of out-group rights than non-religious natives. We argue
   that these findings have to be interpreted in light of asymmetric power
   relationships: Muslim minorities can hardly deny the rights of
   Christians, as this would undermine their own claims. Similarly,
   religious natives increasingly constitute a minority in secular
   societies and may therefore see Muslims as allies in order to strengthen
   the position of religion in Western Europe. The higher approval of
   religious individuals challenges the theory on out-group threat, which
   would lead us to expect that religious individuals are more reluctant to
   embrace out-group rights. Finally, state-church regimes in the
   destination countries play a minor role, while the degree of religiosity
   in the origin countries has an important impact on individual attitudes
   toward religious rights.

AB Information on foreign affairs reaches Americans primarily through the
   news media, yet we know little about why some global actors receive more
   attention than others. We constructed a new data set describing media
   attention to, and US state actions and discourse about, foreign leaders
   from 1950 to 2008 to assess which leaders receive more attention and
   why. The results of our analyses suggest that media attention is
   disproportionately allotted to (1) leaders of the most powerful
   countries in the international system; (2) leaders of countries
   experiencing instability and violence; (3) leaders of countries that
   domestic political elites (Congress and the president) pay attention to,
   or where the US is currently fighting a war; and (4) leaders of
   countries whose connections to global networks signal positions of
   neutrality vis-a-vis the Cold War superpowers. We do not find any
   evidence that media attention diffuses through connections in the world
   polity. We conclude that media attention to foreign leaders is a
   reflection of the dynamics of geopolitical struggles and conflicts
   rather than global interconnectedness. Thus, in the context of attention
   to world leaders, news values favoring conflict and struggle resonate
   more than news values favoring connections and cooperation.

AB The percentage of young American adults residing in their parents' home
   has increased markedly over recent years, but we know little about how
   sociodemographic, life-course, and parental characteristics facilitate
   or impede leaving or returning home. We use longitudinal data from the
   Panel Study of Income Dynamics' Transition into Adulthood survey to
   examine the determinants of leaving and returning home among youth who
   turned age 18 between 2005 and 2011. Findings from event-history models
   show that while leaving and returning home is to some extent a function
   of normative life-course transitions, characteristics of the parental
   home (e.g., presence of coresident siblings, mother's educational
   attainment) and the degree of family connectivity (e.g., emotional
   closeness to mother, instrumental help from family) also play important
   roles. Experiencing physical, including sexual, victimization drives
   young adults both out of, and back into, the parental home. Having
   parents in poor physical health encourages young adults to move back
   home. Overall, the results suggest that a comprehensive explanation for
   both home-leaving and home-returning will need to look beyond
   life-course transitions and standard economic accounts to encompass a
   broader array of push and pull factors, particularly those that bond
   young adults with their parents.

AB Through a critique of Margaret Archer's theory of reflexivity, this
   paper explores the theoretical contribution of a Bourdieusian sociology
   of the subject for understanding social change. Archer's theory of
   reflexivity holds that conscious 'internal conversations' are the motor
   of society, central both to human subjectivity and to the 'reflexive
   imperative' of late modernity. This is established through critiques of
   Bourdieu, who is held to erase creativity and meaningful personal
   investments from subjectivity, and late modernity is depicted as a time
   when a 'situational logic of opportunity' renders embodied dispositions
   and the reproduction of symbolic advantages obsolete. Maintaining
   Archer's focus on 'ultimate concerns' in a context of social change,
   this paper argues that her theory of reflexivity is established through
   a narrow misreading and rejection of Bourdieu's work, which ultimately
   creates problems for her own approach. Archer's rejection of any
   pre-reflexive dimensions to subjectivity and social action leaves her
   unable to sociologically explain the genesis of 'ultimate concerns', and
   creates an empirically dubious narrative of the consequences of social
   change. Through a focus on Archer's concept of 'fractured reflexivity',
   the paper explores the theoretical necessity of habitus and illusio for
   understanding the social changes that Archer is grappling with. In late
   modernity, reflexivity is valorized just as the conditions for its
   successful operation are increasingly foreclosed, creating 'fractured
   reflexivity' emblematic of the complex contemporary interaction between
   habitus, illusio, and accelerating social change.

AB There is an emerging aesthetic turn within sociology which currently
   lacks clear focus. This paper reviews the different issues feeding into
   this interest and contributes to its development. Previous renderings of
   this relationship have set the aesthetic up against sociology, as an
   emphasis which troubles' conventional understandings of sociality and
   offers no ready way of reconciling the aesthetic with the social.
   Reflecting on the contributions of recent social theorists, from figures
   including Bourdieu, Born, Rancisre, Deleuze, and Martin, we argue
   instead for the value of a social aesthetic which critiques
   instrumentalist and reductive understandings of the social itself. In
   explicating what form this might take, the latter parts of the paper
   take issue with classical modernist conceptions of the aesthetic which
   continue to dominate popular and sociological understandings of the
   aesthetic, and uses the motif of walking show how the aesthetic can be
   rendered in terms of ` the mundane search' and how this search spans
   everyday experience and cultural re- production. We offer a provisional
   definition of social aesthetics as the embedded and embodied process of
   meaning making which, by acknowledging the physical/ corporeal
   boundaries and qualities of the inhabited world, also allows imagination
   to travel across other spaces and times. It is hoped that this approach
   can be a useful platform for further inquiry.

AB This article examines whether privileged social groups have managed to
   monopolize access to sought-after higher education (HE) programmes in a
   Scandinavian, universalist welfare state (Denmark) during a period of
   massive educational expansion (1984-2010). I apply an effectively
   maintained inequality (EMI) framework in which I (i) explicitly control
   for periods of educational expansion, (ii) disaggregate qualitatively
   different HE programmes, and (iii) profit from a novel way of
   constructing social origin, using relative measures of parental
   education and income. I find that probabilities of attending HE
   increases for almost all groups and types of programmes, and that the
   increase primarily occurs in periods of cohort-adjusted HE expansion.
   Measured by participation ratio (i.e. relative risk), neither sons nor
   daughters from culturally privileged backgrounds have maintained their
   advantage from 1984 to 2010 in access to HE in general. However,
   breaking down HE into four types of university programmes supports the
   EMI thesis as it is operationalized in this article. So, while
   inequality in access to HE has been reduced overall through the
   expansion of the HE system, this has only been achieved by channelling
   students of lower-educated parents to less-prestigious programmes.

   exiting the labour force and a reduction in work hours. We assess change
   in these transitions in the Netherlands between 1970 and 2008. We test
   whether policy changes, in particular the introduction of unpaid
   parental leave, have changed the opportunity costs of specific
   work-family arrangements for women and their partners. We use detailed
   life-history couple data and estimate multinomial logit models. Our
   results show that over time, new mothers became less likely to exit the
   labour market and more likely to reduce their working hours. Eligibility
   for parental leave and public sector employment reduced the probability
   of exiting the labour market, but had no effect on reducing working
   hours. In the 1990s and for those eligible for parental leave, the
   likelihood that a working hour reduction was associated with a lower job
   level or an employer change decreased. New mothers with an occupational
   status at least as high as that of their male partner were less likely
   to reduce their labour supply. Policy changes did not alter the
   importance of partners' relative occupational resources.

   balance. This study separates four dimensions of temporal flexibility
   and one indicator of spatial flexibility. The dimensions of temporal
   flexibility are the number of hours worked, when the hours are worked,
   work-time intensity, and the degree of working-time autonomy. The
   workplace flexibility indicator is an index of work locations. Work-life
   balance is analysed with work-hour fit. The analyses were based on the

   We used data from 25 Member States of the European Union (n = 25,417).
   Based on the hierarchical cluster analysis, this study found various

   effect on perceived work-life balance even after controlling for

AB An improvement in the availability of opportunities for actors in a
   social system ( e. g. a society or a firm) can coincide with a growing
   rate of frustrated individuals. For instance, uprisings have repeatedly
   been preceded by forms of political liberalization that have provided
   greater opportunities ( the so- called Tocqueville paradox). In
   organizations, satisfaction with regard to promotion opportunities can
   be negatively associated with objective chances of promotion. Raymond
   Boudon has proposed a game- theoretic competition model, which specifies
   the micro- mechanisms that produce these puzzling phenomena at the
   aggregate level and clarifies the conditions under which they emerge. We
   conducted three laboratory experiments to test the model's predictions,
   making our study the first empirical test of Boudon's model. The results
   are mixed: when opportunities increased, the rate of the relatively
   frustrated losers in the group remained constant, or increased only
   slightly. However, when applying another aggregation rule, which
   accounts for all social comparison processes and does not merely focus
   on the losers, an increase in relative frustration under improved
   conditions was observed. Our results imply that under specific
   conditions, there is a trade- off between opportunities and social
   mobility, on the one hand, and social inequality and relative
   frustration, on the other.

   housework, and childcare after the leave has ended. It investigates
   whether the effect of parental leave differs by the length of leave
   taken and by whether fathers took the leave alone or at the same time as
   their partners. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel from
   2006 to 2012 and Families in Germany from 2010 to 2012, the results of
   fixed-effects regressions indicate that fathers who took parental leave
   subsequently reallocated their time from work to home. They reduced
   their working hours and increased their involvement in childcare even
   after short and joint periods of parental leave. But only those who took
   > 2 months of leave or were on leave while their partner was working
   subsequently increased their participation in housework. Hence, fathers
   increased their involvement in childcare already after short leaves,
   whereas enhanced gender equality in couples' division of labour
   especially emerged after longer or solo leaves.

AB Evidence for the often-posited negative relation between ethnic
   diversity and various measures of social capital is burdened by
   difficulties measuring the levels of aggregation at which the indicators
   operate, the common use of cross-sectional data, and by the common
   omission of macro-level variables that plausibly confound the relation
   between ethnic diversity and social capital. To overcome these problems,
   this article studies social capital in Germany. Germany has a sizeable
   immigrant population and a considerable within-country variation in the
   extent to which government institutions and the labour market function.
   Districts also have different democratic histories. To explore to what
   extent social capital can be explained by ethnic diversity and
   institutional characteristics of districts in Germany, we combine data
   from the German Socioeconomic Panel, with relevant macro-level
   characteristics at the level of districts ('Kreise'). We use three-level
   multilevel regression analyses to study the 2003 data, and individual
   fixed effects panel regressions to study the consequences of changes
   between 2003 and 2008. Our findings indicate that ethnic diversity in
   districts has a negative effect on political participation. We find no
   evidence that ethnic diversity is related to other forms of social
   capital.

AB This article is about the impact of 'One-Euro-Jobs', a German active
   labour market programme, on the social integration of unemployed
   individuals. We examine, first, whether programme participation improves
   individuals' sense of social integration. Second, we address the
   mechanisms behind this association by analysing subgroup-specific
   participation effects. Therefore, we analyse how specific programme
   features, the quality of interactions with welfare officials, and
   participants' evaluations of the programme are related to their
   subjective integration. The analysis is based on the German panel study
   'Labour Market and Social Security'. Results from random-effects,
   fixed-effects, and hybrid random-effects regression models do not
   indicate a general positive participation effect, but point to some
   conditions under which the programme can be beneficial. First,
   One-Euro-Jobs bearing greater similarity to regular jobs in terms of
   working hours and duration imply stronger participation effects. Second,
   the quality of social interactions at the local unemployment agencies
   matters: participants benefit more from One-Euro-Jobs in case they feel
   well supported. Third, participants are more likely to experience an
   enhancement of subjective integration if they perceive participation as
   voluntary and beneficial in social and financial terms.

AB While there is ample evidence that income inequalities influence
   individuals' health status, the mechanisms behind this income
   inequality-health correlation are only partially understood. This study
   shows that inequalities evaluated on the basis of individual perceptions
   of injustice are a driving force behind this connection. Two main
   questions are addressed: Does perceiving one's earnings as unfair affect
   physical health? Do such perceptions contribute to structural health
   inequalities? The hypotheses presented are based on the effort-reward
   imbalance model, according to which experiencing injustice causes
   stress, which can have a negative effect on individual health. Analyses
   of large-scale longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel of
   the years 2005-2010 show that female employees who perceive their
   earnings as unjustly low display significantly worse physical health,
   and that if employees perceive their earnings to be unjust for an
   extended period, this contributes to the deterioration of individual
   physical health in male and female employees. Employees from lower
   social classes, in particular unskilled blue-collar workers, more
   frequently perceive their earnings to be unjust. Experience of unjust
   earnings mediates the relationship between social class and physical
   health, if to a limited extent. Our conclusion is that differential
   exposure to unjust earnings contributes to the emergence of structural
   health inequalities.

AB While much research has focused on the difference in earnings between
   childless women and men and mothers and fathers, somewhat less is known
   on the difference in earnings between women and their partners, in
   particular in the transition to parenthood. This article fills this void
   by investigating within-couple earnings inequality in the event of a
   childbirth in different institutional settings. Two research questions
   are addressed: (i) Does a childbirth lead to a reduction in women's
   earned income relative to their partner? (ii) Can mothers compensate the
   loss of labour-related income through alternative sources of income?
   Fixed effects panel models on EU-SILC (2004-2008) data from eight
   European countries show that having a child negatively affects women's
   share of earned income in the majority of countries. However,
   cross-national differences in the results suggest that in countries
   where income support for parents is higher, mothers can rely on
   non-labour sources of income, such as payments from parental leave
   benefits, to compensate the reduction of relative earned income. In
   other words, the results indicate a relative motherhood penalty in
   earnings that is not, ultimately, a relative motherhood penalty in
   income, at least in the short run. In countries where income support for
   parents is lower, by contrast, the negative effect of a childbirth on
   the mothers' earnings is smallest, indicating that women privilege
   remaining in the work force around childbirth.

AB Building on existing theories of fertility dynamics, this article
   provides a theoretical perspective that connects two recent strands of
   the literature. The first concerns gender equity and equality where
   institutions play a critical role. The second is that subjective
   well-being matters in explaining childbearing behaviour (and vice
   versa). Our key argument is that subjective well-being is a direct
   function of the discrepancy between aspirations and attainment, here
   interpreted as a potential mismatch between gender equity and equality.
   As aspirations change over time, discrepancy arises in so far
   institutions are unable to follow suit with new emerging preferences.
   This lowers subjective well-being associated with childbearing, and
   hence leads to lower levels of fertility. Our empirical analysis is
   based on the European Social Survey, and although taking an indirect
   approach, we provide support for this idea. Fertility and happiness are
   higher where institutions appear to have adapted to women's new
   preferences and aspirations, which is further supported by strong gender
   differences in happiness associated with parenthood. Fathers are always
   happier than non-fathers-no matter the circumstances of the country
   where they reside-whereas mothers are happier only when relevant
   institutions are in place.

AB This paper tests whether the 2003 dividend tax cut-one of the largest
   reforms ever to a US capital tax rate-stimulated corporate investment
   and increased labor earnings, using a quasi-experimental design and US
   corporate tax returns from years 1996-2008. I estimate that the tax cut
   caused zero change in corporate investment and employee compensation.
   Economically, the statistical precision challenges leading estimates of
   the cost-of-capital elasticity of investment, or undermines models in
   which dividend tax reforms affect the cost of capital. Either way, it
   may be difficult to implement an alternative dividend tax cut that has
   substantially larger near-term effects.

   Specifically, the paper looks at English securities traded in both
   London and Amsterdam. Private information reached Amsterdam through
   sailing boats that sailed only twice a week and in adverse weather could
   not sail at all. Results are consistent with a Kyle model in which
   informed agents trade strategically. Most importantly, the speed of

   increase output by voluntarily choosing dominated contracts (which

   Second, effort increases closer to (randomly assigned) paydays. Third,
   the contract and payday effects are strongly correlated within workers,

   on either profits or turnover, depending on which tax liability is
   larger. Such schemes create nonstandard kink points, which allow for
   eliciting evasion responses to switches between profit and turnover
   taxes using a bunching approach. Using administrative data on
   corporations in Pakistan, we estimate that turnover taxes reduce evasion
   by up to 60-70 percent of corporate income. Incorporating this in a
   calibrated optimal tax model, we find that switching from profit to
   turnover taxation increases revenue by 74 percent without reducing

AB This study examines whether working with a broker increases or reduces
   the payment received for the last client among female sex workers.
   Building on research on the informal economy and sex work, we formulate
   a positive embeddedness hypothesis, expecting a positive association,
   and an exploitation hypothesis, expecting a negative association. We
   analyze a large survey combined with intensive interview data on female
   sex workers in Andhra Pradesh, India. These data uniquely distinguish
   between the amount the sex worker actually received and the amount the
   client paid. The analyses show that brokers are associated with
   significantly lower last payment received. Although brokers are
   associated with a greater number of clients in the past week, this does
   not result in significantly higher total earnings in the past week.
   Further analyses suggest that much of the negative relationship with
   earnings is due to the fact that brokers lead to a lack of control over
   the amount clients are charged. At the same time, the results fail to
   show that brokers actually provide services of value. Ultimately, the
   results support the exploitation hypothesis. We conclude by encouraging
   the refinement of theories of embeddedness and exploitation and calling
   for greater research on workers in the informal economy of developing
   countries.

AB Scholars have documented the emergence of apparently race-neutral
   discourses that serve to entrench racial stratification following the
   elimination of de jure segregation. These discourses deny the existence
   of both present-day racism and the contemporary effects of histories of
   racial oppression. Researchers posit that individuals are socialized
   into these views, but little empirical attention has been paid to the
   processes through which such socialization occurs. Focusing on the South
   African case study, I draw on five months of daily observations in
   seventeen 9th-grade history classrooms, content analysis of notes
   distributed in class, and 170 in-depth interviews with teachers and
   students to document how and why students are taught not to attend to
   the effects of apartheid on their society. To mitigate race-based
   conflict in their local school context, teachers told both sides of the
   story, highlighting that not all whites were perpetrators and not all
   blacks were victims. By decoupling the racialized coding of victims and
   perpetrators, and sidelining discussions of beneficiaries, teachers
   hindered students' abilities to make connections to the present. In
   outlining how and why individuals are taught about the irrelevance of
   the past, this study contributes to literatures on race, education,
   collective memory, and transition to democracy.

AB The belief that natural sciences are more scientific than the social
   sciences has been well documented in the perceptions of both lay and
   scientific populations. Influenced by the Kuhnian concept of paradigm
   development and empirical studies on the closure of scientific
   controversies, scholars from divergent traditions associate scientific
   development with increased consensus and stability. However, both the
   macro/quantitative and micro/qualitative approaches are limited in key
   ways. This article is the first comparative ethnography of a natural
   science (molecular biology) and a social science (psychology) and it
   highlights important differences between the fields. Molecular
   biologists engage in a process of bench-building, in which they create
   and integrate new manipulation techniques and technologies into their
   practice, whereas psychologists have far less opportunity for this type
   of development. This suggests an alternative conception of the
   natural/social divide, in which the natural sciences are defined by
   dynamic material evolution while the social sciences remain relatively

   with extensive rights-based polities. International law may set a
   political agenda, but once introduced, policies move according to
   internal conditions related to party discipline, the centralization of
   courts, and policy legacies within those countries.

AB Do police treat religious-based protest events differently than secular
   ones? Drawing on data from more than 15,000 protest events in the United
   States (1960 to 1995) and using quantitative methods, we find that law
   enforcement agents were less likely to show up at protests when general
   religious actors, actions, or organizations were present. Rather than
   reflecting privileged legitimacy, we find that this protective effect is
   explained by religious protesters' use of less threatening tactics at
   events. When religion is disaggregated into different traditions, only
   mainline and black Protestant groups have lower rates of policing than
   secular groups. As with the general religion finding, the buffering
   effect these traditions have on policing is mediated by protester
   tactics. Moreover, we find that fundamentalist Christians are more
   likely to be policed than are secular activists when threatening tactics
   are included. Finally, when actors associated with non-Christian
   religions engage in extremely confrontational tactics, they are more
   likely to provoke a police response than are similarly behaving secular
   groups.

AB Why do workers participate in their own exploitation? This article moves
   beyond the situational production of consent that has dominated studies
   of the labor process and outlines the relational production of labor's
   surplus value. Using a case of unpaid women who perform valuable work
   for VIP nightclubs, I present ethnographic data on the VIP party circuit
   from New York, the Hamptons, Miami, and Cannes, as well as 84 interviews
   with party organizers and guests. Party promoters, mostly male brokers,
   appropriate surplus value from women in four stages: recruitment,
   mobilization, performance, and control. Relational work between
   promoters and women, cemented by gifts and strategic intimacies, frames
   women's labor as leisure and friendship, and boundary work legitimizes
   women's work as distinct from sexual labor. When boundaries, media, and
   meanings of relationships do not appropriately align, as in relational
   mismatches, women experience the VIP party less as leisure and more as
   work, and they are less likely to participate. My findings embed the
   labor process in a relational infrastructure and hold insights for
   explaining why people work for free in culture and technology sectors of
   the post-Fordist economy.

AB The transmission of party identification from parent to child is one of
   the most important components of political socialization in the United
   States. Research shows that children learn their party identification
   from their parents, and parents drive the learning process. The vast
   majority of studies thus treats children as passive recipients of
   information and assumes that parent-child concordance equals
   transmission. Rather than relying on a single pathway by which parents
   teach children, we propose an alternative view by focusing on children
   as active agents in their socialization. In so doing, we introduce a
   two-step model of transmission: perception then adoption. Utilizing two
   unique family-based studies that contain self-reported measures of party
   identification for both parents and children, children's perceptions of
   their parents' party affiliations, and measures of the parent-child
   relationship, we find children differentially learn and then choose to
   affiliate, or not, with their parents. These findings challenge several
   core assumptions upon which the extant literature is built, namely that
   the majority of children both know and adopt their parents' party
   identification. We conclude that there is much to be learned by focusing
   on children as active agents in their political socialization.

AB Scholars have increasingly turned to fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative
   Analysis (fsQCA) to conduct small- and medium-N studies, arguing that it
   combines the most desired elements of variable-oriented and
   case-oriented research. This article demonstrates, however, that fsQCA
   is an extraordinarily sensitive method whose results are worryingly
   susceptible to minor parametric and model specification changes. We make
   two specific claims. First, the causal conditions identified by fsQCA as
   being sufficient for an outcome to occur are highly contingent upon the
   values of several key parameters selected by the user. Second, fsQCA
   results are subject to marked confirmation bias. Given its tendency
   toward finding complex connections between variables, the method is
   highly likely to identify as sufficient for an outcome causal
   combinations containing even randomly generated variables. To support
   these arguments, we replicate three articles utilizing fsQCA and conduct
   sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations to assess the impact of
   small changes in parameter values and the method's built-in confirmation
   bias on the overall conclusions about sufficient conditions.

AB Theories of coalition politics in parliamentary democracies have
   suggested that government formation and survival are jointly determined
   outcomes. An important empirical implication of these theories is that
   the sample of observed governments analyzed in studies of government
   survival may be nonrandomly selected from the population of potential
   governments. This can lead to serious inferential problems.
   Unfortunately, current empirical models of government survival are
   unable to account for the possible biases arising from nonrandom
   selection. In this study, we use a copula-based framework to assess, and
   correct for, the dependence between the processes of government
   formation and survival. Our results suggest that existing studies of
   government survival, by ignoring the selection problem, overstate the
   substantive importance of several covariates commonly included in
   empirical models.

AB Politicians and citizens increasingly engage in political conversations

   assumption that social networks are homophilic, I develop a Bayesian
   Spatial Following model that considers ideology as a latent variable,
   whose value can be inferred by examining which politics actors each user
   is following. This method allows us to estimate ideology for more actors
   than any existing alternative, at any point in time and across many
   polities. I apply this method to estimate ideal points for a large

   political parties replicate conventional measures of ideology. The
   method is also able to successfully classify individuals who state their

AB We apply a specialized Bayesian method that helps us deal with the
   methodological challenge of unobserved heterogeneity among immigrant
   voters. Our approach is based on generalized linear mixed Dirichlet
   models (GLMDMs) where random effects are specified semiparametrically
   using a Dirichlet process mixture prior that has been shown to account
   for unobserved grouping in the data. Such models are drawn from Bayesian
   nonparametrics to help overcome objections handling latent effects with
   strongly informed prior distributions. Using 2009 German voting data of
   immigrants, we show that for difficult problems of missing key
   covariates and unexplained heterogeneity this approach provides (1)
   overall improved model fit, (2) smaller standard errors on average, and
   (3) less bias from omitted variables. As a result, the GLMDM changed our
   substantive understanding of the factors affecting immigrants' turnout
   and vote choice. Once we account for unobserved heterogeneity among
   immigrant voters, whether a voter belongs to the first immigrant
   generation or not is much less important than the extant literature
   suggests. When looking at vote choice, we also found that an immigrant's
   degree of structural integration does not affect the vote in favor of
   the CDU/CSU, a party that is traditionally associated with restrictive
   immigration policy.

   effects, a substantial literature has explored the shortcomings of these

   objective baseline, such investigations can only make relative
   comparisons. By focusing specifically on recent Internet activity stored
   by Web browsers, this article's methodology captures individuals' actual
   consumption of political media. Using experiments embedded within an
   online survey, I test three different measures of media exposure and
   compare them to the actual exposure. I find that open-ended survey
   prompts reduce overreporting and generate an accurate picture of the
   overall audience for online news. I also show that they predict news
   recall at least as well as general knowledge. Together, these results
   demonstrate that some ways of asking questions about media use are

AB Panel studies typically suffer from attrition. Ignoring the attrition
   can result in biased inferences if the missing data are systematically
   related to outcomes of interest. Unfortunately, panel data alone cannot
   inform the extent of bias due to attrition. Many panel studies also
   include refreshment samples, which are data collected from a random
   sample of new individuals during the later waves of the panel.
   Refreshment samples offer information that can be utilized to correct
   for biases induced by non-ignorable attrition while reducing reliance on
   strong assumptions about the attrition process. We present a Bayesian
   approach to handle attrition in two-wave panels with one refreshment
   sample and many categorical survey variables. The approach includes (1)
   an additive non-ignorable selection model for the attrition process; and
   (2) a Dirichlet process mixture of multinomial distributions for the
   categorical survey variables. We present Markov chain Monte Carlo
   algorithms for sampling from the posterior distribution of model
   parameters and missing data. We apply the model to correct attrition
   bias in an analysis of data from the 2007-08 Associated Press/Yahoo News

AB Political scientists often turn to natural experiments to draw causal
   inferences with observational data. Recently, the regression
   discontinuity design (RD) has become a popular type of natural
   experiment due to its relatively weak assumptions. We study a special
   type of regression discontinuity design where the discontinuity in
   treatment assignment is geographic. In this design, which we call the
   Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) design, a geographic or
   administrative boundary splits units into treated and control areas, and
   analysts make the case that the division into treated and control areas
   occurs in an as-if random fashion. We show how this design is equivalent
   to a standard RD with two running variables, but we also clarify several
   methodological differences that arise in geographical contexts. We also
   offer a method for estimation of geographically located treatment
   effects that can also be used to validate the identification assumptions
   using observable pretreatment characteristics. We illustrate our
   methodological framework with a re-examination of the effects of
   political advertisements on voter turnout during a presidential
   campaign, exploiting the exogenous variation in the volume of
   presidential ads that is created by media market boundaries.

AB Democracies are more supportive of US positions on important votes in
   the UN General Assembly than of nondemocracies. Is this because
   democracies share common perspectives, or does this pattern reflect
   coercion? Since 1985, US law has stipulated that the US State Department
   identify important votes and that aid disbursements reflect voting
   decisions. To unravel these alternative explanations, we introduce a
   strategic statistical model that allows us to estimate voting
   preferences, vulnerability to influence, and credibility of linkage,
   which are theoretical quantities of interest that are not directly
   observable. The results reject the hypothesis of shared democratic
   values: poor democracies have voting preferences that are more
   oppositional to US positions than autocracies, and they are more willing
   than autocracies to take symbolic stands that may cost them foreign aid.
   Democracies support US positions, however, because US aid linkages are
   more credible when directed toward democratic countries. Splitting the
   sample into Cold War and post-Cold War segments, we find that the end of
   the Cold War changed the way US linkage strategies treated allies and
   left- and right-leaning governments, but the effects of democracy
   remained constant.

AB Despite mixed empirical evidence, in the past two decades central bank
   independence (CBI) has been on the rise under the assumption that it

   new yearly data for de jure CBI (seventy-eight countries, 1973-2008), we
   reexamine this relationship, distinguishing the role of printing less
   money (discipline) from the public's beliefs about the central bank's
   likely actions (credibility). Democracies differ from dictatorships in
   the likelihood of political interference and changes to the law because
   of the presence of political opposition and the freedom to expose
   government actions. CBI in democracies should be directly reflected in
   lower money supply growth. Besides being more disciplinarian, it also
   ensures a more robust money demand by reducing inflation expectations
   and, therefore, inflation. Empirical results are robust and support a
   discipline effect conditioned by political institutions, as well as a

AB War is expensivetroops must be equipped and weapons must be procured.
   When the enormous borrowing requirements of war make the sovereigns'
   credibility problem more difficult, central banks enhance a government's
   ability to borrow. By being the sole direct purchaser of government
   debt, the central bank increases the effective punishment that can be
   imposed on the government for defaulting on the marginal lender. This
   increases lenders' confidence that the government will be punished in
   case of default, making lenders willing to purchase the debt at a lower
   rate of interest. The sovereign, dependent on the low borrowing costs
   offered by the central bank, has an incentive to retain the bank. Data
   covering the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries reveal that
   possessing a central bank lowers the sovereign's borrowing costs,
   particularly during times of war.

AB Although a considerable literature identifies the conditions under which

   question of when sanctioning states or senders are willing to enforce
   their sanctions laws against their firms. Using a game theoretic model,
   we argue that imposing sanctions creates a strategic dilemma for
   senders. We demonstrate that senders often have disincentives to enforce
   their sanctions policies, given that the restriction on economic
   transactions with targeted states may undermine their firms'
   competitiveness. The model indicates that sanctions are more likely to
   succeed when the sender's firm retains a moderate share of the target's
   market relative to its foreign competitors. However, the model also
   demonstrates that sanctions are likely to be imposed only when the
   conditions do not favor their success. The empirical implications of the
   model are tested using the Threat and Imposition of Economic Sanctions

   international systemic factors, we argue that revolution fosters
   conflict in part by affecting states' domestic political structures.
   Previous research has shown that revolution tends to bring particularly
   aggressive leaders to power. We demonstrate that revolutions also
   frequently result in personalist dictatorships, or regimes that lack
   powerful institutions to constrain and punish leaders. By empowering and
   ensconcing leaders with revisionist preferences and high risk tolerance,
   revolutions that result in personalist dictatorships are significantly
   more likely to lead to international conflict than revolutions that
   culminate in other forms of government. Our arguments and evidence help
   explain not only why revolution so commonly leads to conflict, but also
   why some revolutions lead to conflict whereas others do not.

AB This research note hypothesizes that international agreements including
   a finite duration provision or with a shorter expected duration should
   take less time to negotiate. Using a random sample of agreements across
   different issue areas, it finds statistical support for this hypothesis.
   Agreements without a finite duration provision experienced a bargaining
   phase that was twice as long as agreements including a finite duration
   provision and otherwise short-term agreements. This result not only
   offers empirical support for the theoretical proposition that a longer
   shadow of the future leads to increased bargaining delayit also has
   important policy implications. International negotiators can include a
   finite duration provision when they prefer a shorter bargaining phase to
   a potentially more durable agreement, and they can avoid this feature
   when they prefer a more durable agreement, although this decision comes
   with the cost of additional bargaining delay. By treating finite
   duration provisions as an independent variable, this result also
   addresses a critique of the research program on the rational design of
   international institutions that it moves backward by considering only
   design features as dependent variables.

AB According to recent research, ethnoracial diversity negatively affects
   trust and social capital. This article challenges the current conception
   and measurement of diversity and invites scholars to rethink social
   capital in complex societies. It reproduces the analysis of Putnam and
   shows that the association between diversity and self-reported trust is
   a compositional artifact attributable to residential sorting: nonwhites
   report lower trust and are overrepresented in heterogeneous communities.
   The association between diversity and trust is better explained by
   differences between communities and their residents in terms of
   race/ethnicity, residential stability, and economic conditions; these
   classic indicators of inequality, not diversity, strongly and
   consistently predict self-reported trust. Diversity indexes also obscure
   the distinction between in-group and out-group contact. For whites,
   heterogeneity means more out-group neighbors; for nonwhites,
   heterogeneity means more in-group neighbors. Therefore, separate
   analyses were conducted by ethnoracial groups. Only for whites does
   living among out-group membersnot in diverse communities per
   senegatively predict trust.

AB The WHO's International Studies of Schizophrenia conclude that
   schizophrenia may have a more benign course in developing societies than
   in the West. The authors focus on this finding's most common corollary:
   cultural schemata are shaped by the transition from agrarian to
   industrial society. Developing societies are viewed as traditional,
   gemeinschaft cultures lacking the stigmatizing beliefs about persons
   with mental illness held in modern, gesellschaft cultures of developed
   societies. The Stigma in Global ContextMental Health Study formalized
   the cultural myth of public stigma (CMPS) with propositions linking
   level of development to intolerant, exclusionary, and individualistic
   attitudes. In 17 countries, the authors find no support for the
   corollary; where support is found, the findings are opposite
   expectations, with developed societies reporting lower stigma levels.
   Reconceptualizing of the cultural landscape on more specific dimensions
   also produces null or contrary findings. This correction to nostalgic
   myths of cultural context in developing societies thwarts misguided
   treatment, policy, and stigma-reduction efforts.

AB Controversy sets abortion apart from other issues studied by world
   society theorists, who consider the tendency for policies
   institutionalized at the global level to diffuse across very different
   countries. The authors conduct an event history analysis of the spread
   (however limited) of abortion liberalization policies from 1960 to 2009.
   After identifying three dominant frames (a women's rights frame, a
   medical frame, and a religious, natural family frame), the authors find
   that indicators of a scientific, medical frame show consistent
   association with liberalization of policies specifying acceptable
   grounds for abortion. Women's leadership roles have a stronger and more
   consistent liberalizing effect than do countries' links to a global
   women's rights discourse. Somewhat different patterns emerge around the
   likelihood of adopting an additional policy, controlling for first
   policy adoption. Even as support for women's autonomy has grown
   globally, with respect to abortion liberalization, persistent, powerful
   frames compete at the global level, preventing robust policy diffusion.

   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to investigate
   gene-environment interaction effects on youth binge drinking. In ROOM,
   the environmental influence was measured by the precollege drinking
   behavior of randomly assigned roommates. Random assignment safeguards
   against friend selection and removes the threat of gene-environment
   correlation that makes gene-environment interaction effects difficult to
   interpret. On average, being randomly assigned a drinking peer as
   opposed to a nondrinking peer increased college binge drinking by
   0.5-1.0 episodes per month, or 20%-40% the average amount of binge
   drinking. However, this peer influence was found only among youths with
   a medium level of genetic propensity for alcohol use; those with either
   a low or high genetic propensity were not influenced by peer drinking. A
   replication of the findings is provided in data drawn from Add Health.
   The study shows that gene-environment interaction analysis can uncover
   social-contextual effects likely to be missed by traditional
   sociological approaches.

AB Both aristocratic privileges and constitutional constraints in
   traditional monarchies can be derived from a ruler's incentive to
   minimize expected costs of moral-hazard rents for high officials. We
   consider a dynamic moral-hazard model of governors serving a sovereign
   prince, who must deter them from rebellion and hidden corruption which
   could cause costly crises. To minimize costs, a governor's rewards for
   good performance should be deferred up to the maximal credit that the
   prince can be trusted to pay. In the long run, we find that high
   officials can become an entrenched aristocracy with low turnover and
   large claims on the ruler. Dismissals for bad performance should be
   randomized to avoid inciting rebellions, but the prince can profit from
   reselling vacant offices, and so his decisions to dismiss high officials
   require institutionalized monitoring. A soft budget constraint that
   forgives losses for low-credit governors can become efficient when costs
   of corruption are low.

AB Our paper provides a complete characterization of leverage and default
   in binomial economies with financial assets serving as collateral. Our
   Binomial No-Default Theorem states that any equilibrium is equivalent
   (in real allocations and prices) to another equilibrium in which there
   is no default. Thus actual default is irrelevant, though the potential
   for default drives the equilibrium and limits borrowing. This result is
   valid with arbitrary preferences and endowments, contingent or
   noncontingent promises, many assets and consumption goods, production,
   and multiple periods. We also show that only no-default equilibria would
   be selected if there were the slightest cost of using collateral or
   handling default. Our Binomial Leverage Theorem shows that equilibrium
   Loan to Value (LTV) for noncontingent debt contracts is the ratio of the
   worst-case return of the asset to the riskless gross rate of interest.
   In binomial economies, leverage is determined by down risk and not by
   volatility.

   Economics, 112 [1997], 407-441), who find that the wage elasticity of
   daily hours of work for New York City taxi drivers is negative and
   conclude that their labor supply behavior is consistent with reference
   dependence. In contrast, my analysis of the complete record of all trips
   taken in NYC taxi cabs from 2009 to 2013 shows that drivers tend to
   respond positively to unanticipated as well as anticipated increases in
   earnings opportunities. Additionally, using a discrete choice stopping
   model, the probability of a shift ending is strongly positively related
   to hours worked but at best weakly related to income earned. I find
   substantial heterogeneity across drivers in their elasticities, but the
   estimated elasticities are generally positive and rarely substantially
   negative. I find that new drivers with smaller elasticities are more
   likely to exit the industry, whereas drivers who remain quickly learn to
   be better optimizers (have positive labor supply elasticities that grow
   with experience). These results are consistent with the neoclassical
   optimizing model of labor supply and suggest that consideration of
   gain-loss utility and income reference dependence is not an important
   factor in the daily labor supply decisions of taxi drivers.

AB Does limiting managers' discretion limit organizations' scope for
   discrimination? Social-psychological research argues that it limits
   opportunities to exercise cognitive biases. Organizational research has
   found that formal personnel practices that establish accountability for
   workplace diversity have increased women and minority representation in
   management. However, drawing causal inferences from such studies is
   complicated because adopting such policies may be endogenous to the
   firm's wish to hire and promote women and minorities. This study uses
   unionization elections to conduct a regression-discontinuity test from
   which stronger causal inferences can be made. It finds that while
   unionization is associated with more representative workplaces and more
   women and minorities in management, these effects disappear close to the
   discontinuity threshold. Most of the effects of unionization on
   workforce diversity may be attributable to the unobserved drivers of
   selection into unionization. This has similar implications for the
   causal effects of diversity policies adopted by managers.

   concludes that leaders avoid politics because it stigmatizes them within
   their politically structured competition, or game, for community esteem.
   Postwar federalism enhanced locals' control by sheltering firms from
   outside acquisitions and transferring discretionary grants to local
   bodies, thus creating an arena that privileged fighters who engaged
   publicly by forming rigid, oppositional factions. Neoliberal reforms
   made leaders dependent on mobile firms and competitive funding streams,
   conditions that elevate partners who avoid conflict and form flexible

   fear that political divisiveness will undermine their community esteem

   In this article I estimate the effects of instructional time on
   students' achievement using PISA 2006 data, which include data samples
   from over 50 countries. I find that instructional time has a positive
   and significant effect on test scores, and that the effect is much lower
   in developing countries. Evidence also suggests that the productivity of
   instructional time is higher in countries which implemented school
   accountability measures or that gave schools autonomy in budgetary
   decisions and in hiring/firing teachers.

AB Incarceration, now a rite of passage for many economically disadvantaged
   minority men entailing an involuntary removal from families, places
   these marginal men in a liminal state where they are simultaneously
   members of families and isolated from families. Despite a burgeoning
   literature documenting the collateral consequences of incarceration for
   family life, as well as evidence that the deleterious consequences of
   incarceration for maternal and child well-being stem from resultant
   relationship dissolution, much less is known about the direct link
   between incarceration and relationship dissolution. I consider this
   association with data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing
   Study, a longitudinal survey uniquely positioned to understand the
   consequences of incarceration for family life. Results show that
   paternal incarceration is associated with relatively immediate
   relationship dissolution among parents, the association is concentrated
   among parents living together prior to incarceration, and is explained
   by both incarceration duration and changes in relationship quality. And,
   for couples that survive this initial period, incarceration is
   inconsequential for relationship dissolution. Taken together, these
   findings link the literature on the collateral consequences of mass
   incarceration with the literature on demographic changes in family life,
   and, given the well-known deleterious consequences of parental
   relationship dissolution for children, have important implications for
   intergenerational inequality.

AB Increased inequality in life expectancies across nations due to the
   advent of the HIV pandemic requires rigorous investigation of gender
   inequalities, as women now disproportionally represent the majority of
   global HIV cases. While empirical examinations of women's status on HIV
   prevalence and life expectancy have amassed, one under-explored area of
   concern is the influence of environmental decline. We fill this gap by
   integrating ecofeminist perspectives to inform our analysis of the
   direct and indirect effects of ecological losses on female health
   outcomes in a structural equation model of 136 less developed nations.
   We find that ecological losses reduce women's longevity via increased
   HIV rates, hunger, and diminished health resources. Conclusions point to
   the importance of ecological conditions and the efficacy of
   incorporating ecofeminist frameworks to explain global health and gender
   inequalities.

AB Over the past four decades, the criminal justice system has emerged as a
   key institution structuring social, economic, and political inequalities
   in the United States. Among individuals with felony records, the lack of
   political participation resulting from legal and non-legal barriers has
   likely altered election outcomes and has critical implications for our
   democratic principles. However, the focus on individuals may
   underestimate the reverberating consequences of diminished political
   participation. In this article, I propose that criminal justice contact,
   and specifically incarceration, diminishes political behavior among not
   only formerly incarcerated individuals but also their romantic partners.
   Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing survey, I find
   that partner incarceration is associated with reduced political
   participation that is not explained by socioeconomic characteristics and
   is robust to different modeling approaches. Diminished participation is
   not due to a partner's influence or a lack of financial resources. It is
   also not one aspect of broad withdrawal from civic and religious
   domains. Rather, reduced political participation is a specific retreat
   from government. I suggest that these findings align with political
   socialization, where lessons about government are learned through
   interactions and experiences with the criminal justice system.

AB While previous studies of ethnic contention and conflict identify
   important structural and meso-level indicators of threat and
   competition, analysis of variation in the mechanisms linking these
   sources of potential grievance formation with mobilization remains
   unclear. To address this issue, this study explores the social
   organization of Ku Klux Klan mobilization in 1960s North Carolina. While
   regarded as a progressive state in the civil rights era, North Carolina
   exhibited a greater level of Klan mobilization than the rest of the
   South combined. We build on models of "mediated competition," where
   ethnic competition and group threat are held as necessary, and
   propinquity, authority work, and legacies of previous racial violence
   link threat and competition with mobilization. Extending prior
   formulations centered on the discrete impact of individual components of
   competition, we employ fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to
   precisely specify the conjunctural conditions governing two modes of
   Klan mobilization: public rally events and the establishment of local
   organizational units. Our findings indicate that the mobilizing effects
   of threat and competition varied between rural and urban areas, and that
   threat/competition and organization/leadership play a dual role in
   translating collective grievances into mobilization.

AB Sociologists have long been concerned with the extent to which
   "civilizing processes" lead to the increasing salience of rationalized
   behavioral guidelines and corresponding internal controls, especially in
   social situations characterized by violence. Following Norbert Elias's
   identification of a civilizing process in combat sports, sociologists
   have debated, though not empirically established, whether emerging
   "no-holds-barred" fight practices indicate a rupture in the historical
   civilization of leisure time violence. Using a critical case study of a
   "no-rules" weapons fighting group, where participants espouse
   libertarian values and compete in preparation for hypothetical
   self-defense encounters, I ask how the boundary between violence and
   social regulation is negotiated in an arena that putatively aims to
   remove the latter. Drawing on more than three years of ethnographic
   fieldwork, I specify the mechanisms that moderate action: (1) the
   cultivation of a code of honor and linked dispositions to replace
   codified rules; (2) the interactional hesitance that arises when
   participants lack clear rules or norms to coordinate action; and (3) the
   importation of external rule sets, such as self-defense law, to simulate
   the "real" world. Contrary to surface readings of "no-rules" discourse,
   I conclude that the activity is deeply embedded in larger societal norms
   of order. Participants' ethos of honorable self-governance, "thresholds
   of repugnance" when exposed to serious injury, and aim of transforming
   emotive, violent reaction into reflective, instrumental action all
   indicate that the ostensibly unrestrained violence is, in Elias's
   technical sense, precisely civilized.

AB Current sociological studies on children of immigrants largely focus on
   how well children integrate into U.S society. Working against this
   outcome-oriented framework, which undermines the importance of
   children's social location and situated doings, this study employs an
   interactional, intersectional approach to examine how bilingual youth
   navigate multiple inequalities when they translate for their immigrant
   parents. Based on 72 interviews with Mexican American and Korean
   American youth, my findings demonstrate that these "language brokers"
   confront racialized nativism and develop different interactional
   strategies to negotiate power imbalances pertaining to age, race, and
   class in different institutional contexts. Paying particular attention
   to structural barriers that limit the effectiveness of these strategies
   while highlighting their considerable agency, I argue that children of
   immigrants do not simply become American. Rather, they strategically use
   their "outsider-within" position and perform "American" behaviors in an
   attempt to gain social citizenship rights. This study, therefore, calls
   attention to how the margin, as a social location, can create moments of
   resistance and empowerment.

AB Social movements strive for policy changes that will realize their
   conception of the "perfect world." To achieve their aims as rapidly as
   possible, movements attempt to identify the most effective ways of
   influencing decision makers. In parliamentary democracies, the central
   decision makers are political parties. Much of the existing literature
   emphasizes the use of public pressure and lobbying. To complement this
   literature, I argue that the intersection between political parties and
   social movements is also a strong and stable means for activists to
   influence policy. Using novel microdata on the German antinuclear
   movement, and particularly its success in influencing the shutdown of
   nuclear power plants, I demonstrate that movements realize their goals
   significantly more rapidly when their intersection with political
   parties increases. My results also suggest that there is a tipping point
   beyond which the effect of this intersection declines.

AB Building on the unfinished research program of Gudgin and Taylor (1979),
   we analytically derive the linkage between a party's territorial
   distribution of support and the basic features of its vote-seat curve.
   We then demonstrate the usefulness of the corresponding empirical model
   with an analysis of elections in postwar Great Britain, focusing in
   particular on the transformation of the Liberals from a territorially
   concentrated to a dispersed party in the 1970s. We show that
   majoritarian biases increase with the number of parties, and
   majoritarian systems harm small parties when their vote is more
   dispersed than average, and large parties when their vote is more
   concentrated than average. Moreover, the evolving experiences of Labour
   and Conservatives demonstrate how a party's territorial support, and
   hence its expected seat premium or penalty, changes with its electoral
   fortunes. This model has a wide variety of applications in multiparty
   majoritarian democracies around the world.

AB Prior research provides limited insights into when political
   communications prime or change citizens' underlying opinions. This
   article helps fill that void by putting forth an account of priming and
   opinion change. I argue that crystallized attitudes should often be
   primed by new information. An influx of attention to less crystallized
   preferences, however, should lead individuals to alter their underlying
   opinions in accordance with prior beliefs. Since predispositions
   acquired early in the life cyclesuch as partisanship, religiosity, basic
   values, and group-based affect/antagonismsare more crystallized than
   mass opinion about public policy, media and campaign content will tend
   to prime citizens' predispositions and change their policy positions.
   Both my review of previous priming research and original analyses
   presented in this study from five new cases strongly support the
   crystallization-based account of when mass opinion is primed or changed.
   I conclude with a discussion of the article's potential political,
   methodological, and normative implications.

AB Parties often tailor their campaign message differently to different
   groups of voters with the goal of appealing to a broader electorate with
   diverse preferences and thereby winning their votes. I argue that the
   strategy helps a party win votes if it can convince diverse groups of
   voters that the party is ideologically closer to their preferred
   positions. Using election data from nine Western European democracies, I
   first show that parties gain votes when they appeal broadly. Analysis of
   individual-level survey data suggests that voters perceive broadly
   appealing parties as ideologically closer to their own positions, a
   finding that identifies a plausible mechanism behind the aggregate
   positive effect of this strategy on party election performance. These
   findings not only help explain the behavior of some European parties,
   but they may also offer a potential recipe for electoral success in
   multiparty democracies.

AB Jurisprudential regimes theory (JRT) posits that legal change on the
   U.S. Supreme Court occurs in a drastic, structural-break-like manner.
   Methodological debates present conflicting evidence for JRT, which has
   implications for the important law versus ideology debate. We confront
   this debate by first elaborating two alternative theoretical
   perspectives to JRTevolutionary change and legal stability. Our
   analytical framework focuses on two key substantive effects of
   jurisprudential categories on the Court's case outcomesrelative
   differences between categories over multiple time periods and
   longitudinal differences across time periods. Importantly, different
   pieces of empirical evidence can provide support for different dynamic
   processes. The extent to which law matters is not necessarily tied to
   one particular model of legal change. Empirical analysis of updated and
   backdated free expression data generates key findings consistent with
   JRT, legal stability, and evolutionary change. We discuss the
   implications of the results for understanding legal change and legal
   influence.

AB While some believe that economic development prompts democratization,
   others contend that both result from distant historical causes. Using
   the most comprehensive estimates of national income available, I show
   that development is associated with more democratic governmentbut mostly
   in the medium run (10 to 20 years). This is because higher income tends
   to induce breakthroughs to more democratic politics only after an
   incumbent dictator leaves office. And in the short run, faster economic
   growth increases the ruler's survival odds. Leader turnover appears to
   matter because of selection: In authoritarian states, reformist leaders
   tend to either democratize or lose power relatively quickly, so
   long-serving leaders are rarely reformers. Autocrats also become less
   activist after their first year in office. This logic helps explain why
   dictators, concerned only to prolong their rule, often inadvertently
   prepare their countries for jumps to democracy after they leave the
   scene.

AB This article investigates the supply side of women's political
   representation by focusing on how the election of female politicians
   affects the motivation of women to run for office in other units. The
   analysis relies on an original data set of over 1,500 municipal
   elections in Switzerland, starting with the first election after the
   introduction of women's suffrage. In the first election in which women
   could participate, the election of a woman in a given municipality was
   associated in the next election with an additional female candidate in
   10% of its neighbors. The relationship decreases over time, fades away
   after 16 years, and is driven primarily by new female candidates in
   units where no female incumbents are running for reelection. These
   findings suggest that role models are important for improving women's
   representation, but only in its early stages. This conclusion could be
   relevant for understanding the political representation of other
   underrepresented groups.

AB Audience costs theory posits that domestic publics punish leaders for
   making an external threat and then backing down. One key mechanism
   driving this punishment involves the value the public places on
   consistency between their leaders' statements and actions. If true, this
   mechanism should operate not only when leaders fail to implement
   threats, but also when they fail to honor promises to stay out of a
   conflict. We use a survey experiment to examine domestic responses to
   the president's decision to back down from public threats and back into
   foreign conflicts. We find the president loses support in both cases,
   but suffers more for backing out than backing in. These differential
   consequences are partially explained by asymmetries in the public's
   treatment of new information. Our findings strongly suggest that
   concerns over consistency undergird audience costs theory and that
   punishment for inconsistency will be incurred, regardless of the
   leader's initial policy course.

   unconstitutional can generate up to a 28% relative reduction in the

   increase the probability of adoption by a similar amount and more than

AB Considerable ambiguity exists regarding the effect of
   government/opposition status on party platform change. Existing theories
   predict that (1) it has no effect, (2) opposition parties change more,
   (3) opposition parties change more after several spells in opposition,
   and (4) parties' responses vary because of different goal orientations.
   We propose that a party's aspiration to office, measured by its
   historical success or failure in entering office, determines a party's
   reaction to being in opposition or government. We hypothesize that,
   because of loss aversion, parties with low office aspiration change more
   when they are in government than when they are in opposition.
   Conversely, parties with high office aspiration change more as
   opposition party than as government party. We find evidence for these
   hypotheses through a pooled time-series cross-sectional analysis of
   1,686 platform changes in 21 democracies, using the Comparative
   Manifesto Data and an innovative measure of party platform change.

AB Using the Rosenbaum (2002, 2009) approach to observational studies, we
   show how qualitative information can be incorporated into quantitative
   analyses to improve causal inference in three ways. First, by including
   qualitative information on outcomes within matched sets, we can
   ameliorate the consequences of the difficulty of measuring those
   outcomes, sometimes reducing p-values. Second, additional information
   across matched sets enables the construction of qualitative confidence
   intervals on effect size. Third, qualitative information on unmeasured
   confounders within matched sets reduces the conservativeness of
   Rosenbaum-style sensitivity analysis. This approach accommodates small
   to medium sample sizes in a nonparametric framework, and therefore it
   may be particularly useful for analyses of the effects of policies or
   institutions in a small number of units. We illustrate these methods by
   examining the effect of using plurality rules in transitional
   presidential elections on opposition harassment in 1990s sub-Saharan
   Africa.

AB An underlying assumption of proportional hazards models is that the
   effect of a change in a covariate on the hazard rate of event occurrence
   is constant over time. For scholars using the Cox model, a Schoenfeld
   residual-based test has become the disciplinary standard for detecting
   violations of this assumption. However, using this test requires
   researchers to make a choice about a transformation of the time scale.
   In practice, this choice has largely consisted of arbitrary decisions
   made without justification. Using replications and simulations, we
   demonstrate that the decision about time transformations can have
   profound implications for the conclusions reached. In particular, we
   show that researchers can make far more informed decisions by paying
   closer attention to the presence of outlier survival times and levels of
   censoring in their data. We suggest a new standard for best practices in
   Cox diagnostics that buttresses the current standard with in-depth
   exploratory data analysis.

   present the first estimation of time series of polarization using the
   same method on the most comprehensive data for both the public and the

   little increase in the dispersion of views in the public from 1956 to
   2012 but do find an increase in ideological sorting starting around
   1980. The two time series bear little resemblance to one another with
   respect to divergence. Further, while congressional sorting exceeds that

   mitigates the uncertainty about the true distribution of the
   fundamentals. Agents who lack knowledge of this distribution cannot
   correctly interpret the information other investors impound into the
   price. We show that, due to uncertainty aversion, the incentives to
   reduce uncertainty by acquiring information increase as more investors
   acquire information. When uncertainty is high enough, information
   acquisition decisions become strategic complements and lead to multiple
   equilibria. Swift changes in information demand can drive large price

AB We study the relationship between the political connections of Chinese

   that the worker death rate for connected companies is two to three times
   that of unconnected firms (depending on the sample employed), a pattern
   that holds for within-firm estimations. The connections-mortality
   relationship is attenuated in provinces where safety regulators'
   promotion is contingent on meeting safety targets. In the absence of
   fatalities, connected firms receive fewer reports of major violations
   for safety compliance, whereas in years of fatal accidents the rate of
   reported violations is identical. Moreover, fatal accidents produce
   negative returns at connected companies and are associated with the
   subsequent departure of well-connected executives. These results provide
   suggestive evidence that connections enable firms to avoid (potentially
   costly) compliance measures, rather than using connections to avoid
   regulatory response after accidents occur. Our findings emphasize the
   social costs of political connections, and suggest that appropriate
   regulatory incentives may be useful in mitigating these costs.

AB How do entrepreneurs vary firm size, capital structure, and default to
   manage risk? We show that more risk-averse entrepreneurs run smaller,
   more highly leveraged firms and default less, because running a smaller
   firm with higher debt reduces personal funds at risk in the firm.
   Optimal default depends on ex ante debt, consumption forgone from firm
   liquidation, and owner capacity to inject funds. We show that
   entrepreneurs sacrifice current consumption in the hope of future
   success that never materializes for the bottom 25 percent, but
   entrepreneurship is a path toward great wealth and high consumption for
   the top quartile.

AB In many developing countries property rights over rural land are
   maintained through continuous personal use instead of by land titles. We
   show that removing the link between land use and land rights through the
   issuance of ownership certificates can result in large-scale adjustments
   to labor and land allocations. Using the rollout of the Mexican land
   certification program from 1993 to 2006, we find that households
   obtaining certificates were subsequently 28 percent more likely to have
   a migrant member. We also show that even though land certification
   induced migration, it had little effect on cultivated area due to
   consolidation of farm units.

AB This article aims to improve our understanding about why and how
   individuals' signals of cognitive and noncognitive skills influence
   labour market outcomes. We study how employers use skills signals when
   hiring labour market entrants. These demand-side microprocesses are
   investigated at the apprenticeship market in Germany, which functions as
   the main entry labour market below tertiary-level education. Qualitative
   studies and personnel psychology research suggest multistage hiring
   processes. We concentrate on the first stage at which employers narrow
   the applicant pools based on written application documents. Their
   information is limited to applicants' school reports-including their
   grades (as signals of cognitive skills) and teachers' evaluations of
   their behaviours (as signals of noncognitive skills). We conducted two
   linked field experiments, applying the correspondence test method.
   Analysing the unbiased employers' responses to randomly varied
   fictitious applicant profiles enables us to discover whether, and if so
   how, applicants' skills signals are used as 'screens' at the first
   selection stage. The experiments reveal that both skills signals are
   important selection criteria, but employers prefer noncognitive skills
   signals. Moreover, the findings confirm that firms use thresholds
   (cut-off values) for selection criteria instead of linear rankings.

AB In Germany, as in other modern societies, a low representation of women
   in top positions remains a stable form of gender inequality in the
   labour market. This article examines the extent to which a partner's
   labour market and financial resources influence gender-specific
   probabilities of obtaining a leadership position. Well-established
   theories are examined that provide different assumptions as to how
   partners' resources can affect occupational careers. This article adds
   to the existing body of research by applying a relational perspective on
   couples' resources. To resolve the research question, data from the
   Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) study (waves 1984-2010) are used in a
   longitudinal design employing event history analysis (N = 11,050 men and
   N = 8,988 women). The results show that partners' relative resources
   play a significant role in the promotion to the top: Whereas for women
   their own comparative advantage is particularly important, especially
   for men higher resources of the partner are beneficial. The results can
   be explained by negotiation processes as well as with a transfer of
   social capital. Additionally, both genders profit from homogamous
   partnership constellations. Overall, women's chances of gaining a
   leadership position appear to be more determined by partners' relative
   resources than it is the case for men.

AB This article investigates how the negative impact of parental separation
   on children's educational outcomes varies with social origin. In
   particular, I test the compensatory class hypothesis which postulates
   that higher class families compensate the negative effects of
   disadvantageous life events, such as parental separation. I apply
   family-fixed effects models to control for unmeasured confounding
   characteristics of families and use data on siblings from Germany. I do
   find indication of substantial negative effects of parental separation
   on the probability of attending the upper track in secondary school
   (Gymnasium) and on school grades in German and Mathematics. These
   negative consequences of parental separation are limited to children
   with low-educated parents. Children in families with highly educated
   parents are not negatively affected by their parents' separation in
   their educational outcomes. This finding supports the compensatory class
   hypothesis and demonstrates that research on the consequences of
   parental separation has to take into account the heterogeneity of
   separation effects.

AB Using retrospective data from the Russian Education and Employment
   Survey, we examine labour market entry in Russia in terms of changes in
   horizontal gender segregation and vertical gender inequalities before
   and after the collapse of the Soviet regime in 1991. Our results provide
   evidence for horizontal gender segregation across branches of the
   economy among labour market entrants in Russia, which have been growing
   since 1991. Moreover, horizontal differences seem to be driving vertical
   gender inequalities in terms of entry into authoritative positions.
   Accounting for heterogeneity in education and the entered branch, we
   find that despite gender equality principles and full-time employment
   for women, vertical gender inequalities had already existed under the
   Soviet regime. However, these increased during the liberalization
   reforms. These growing vertical gender inequalities can be traced back
   mainly to a worsening of female chances in an economic transition,
   whereas there was no significant change for male entrants. Furthermore,
   women seem to be particularly disadvantaged among highly qualified
   entrants. We conclude that Russian female entrants have not fully
   converted their educational advantage into occupational opportunities
   since the transition from socialism to a liberalized market economy.

AB In the course of the Bologna Process, European higher education systems
   have experienced major reforms. In Germany as in several other
   countries, the main novelty was a reduction of the length of study to
   get a first-level degree (Bachelor), together with the introduction of a
   second-level degree (Master's). One of the priorities of the Bologna
   Process is the so-called 'social dimension', meaning that participation
   in higher education should be widened by fostering the potential of
   students from under-represented groups, such as those from
   socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. To evaluate this reform
   goal, this article tests whether the shortening of the length of study
   to get a first degree countervails the under-representation. I use
   variation introduced by the non-uniform adaption of the new degree
   structure to identify the effect. Using repeated cross-sectional student
   survey data to generate panel data at the level of study courses,
   fixed-effects estimators indicate that the shortening has no (positive)
   effect on the share of students from low social origins.

AB In Germany, research on inequalities in secondary education has
   concentrated mainly on the unequal allocation of primary school children
   from different social backgrounds to secondary schools. As a result,
   knowledge about alternative paths of secondary education is scarce.
   These alternative paths were introduced to reduce inequalities by
   offering children from less favourable social backgrounds a 'second
   chance' to attain higher secondary education. Up to now, little is known
   about whether or not such alternative paths of secondary education
   actually reduce inequalities. Using newly available data, this empirical
   study investigates the utilization of these atypical paths. Results show
   that a significant proportion of individuals (overall, about 27 per
   cent) upgrade their initial level of secondary education. Hence, the
   highly stratified German educational system is far more open than
   previously assumed. Nonetheless, this openness has failed to reduce
   inequalities. Quite the contrary, inequalities have increased further,
   because it is especially members of already privileged social groups who
   use alternative paths in secondary education.

AB Prior research has identified a large number of factors that explain
   differences in scholastic achievement. However, analyses of the
   educational performance of students from immigrant families and possible
   changes in these performances over time remain quite scarce. The present
   article addresses this shortcoming by means of a multilevel analysis of
   24 Western countries based on PISA data from 2000 to 2012. Since the
   relevance of individual explanatory factors and school characteristics
   has been repeatedly shown, we focus on structural effects at the level
   of national policies. Our results show that the disparities in
   educational success between native and immigrant youth declined between
   2000 and 2012 in several countries under study, especially in Central
   Europe. Nevertheless, there still are marked and relatively stable
   differences between various types of immigrant societies (e.g.
   traditional immigration countries like Canada vs. Continental European
   Countries like Germany). Analysing macro-level factors we observe
   stability as well as change: On the one hand, the positive effect of the
   quality of the educational system for immigrant students' educational
   achievement remains stable. On the other hand, negative effects of the
   stratification of the educational system diminished, while educational
   expenditures gained influence over the last decade.

AB Tests of hypotheses explaining the variation in church attendance are
   dominated by the use of international comparative survey data covering
   many countries with only a limited number of samples within these
   countries. As a result, the main research focus is on between country
   effects and hardly on within country effects. The latter, however,
   comprises a more convincing test, because fewer assumptions about
   unobserved country-specific variables are required. Elaborating on
   various analytical models, we show that results from a between country
   research design may lead to inaccurate conclusions. To illustrate this
   point, we selected the Mannheim Eurobarometer Trend File, which includes
   as many European countries on as many points in time as possible. Step
   by step we disentangle the well-known strong negative overall between
   country correlation of social security with church attendance. We show
   that this correlation most likely is owing to unspecified country
   characteristics, as within countries, social security is sometimes
   positively related to church attendance and sometimes negatively,
   whereas on average there is no effect at all. Rather than increases in
   social security spending, rising gross domestic product seems to reduce
   church attendance. Our cautionary tale about the use of between country
   research designs applies to other fields of research as well.

AB Temporary employment contracts can serve as a bridge into permanent
   employment or become a trap that leads into unemployment. This article
   argues that the function of temporary employment varies with the degree
   of task complexity and affects the probability of receiving tenure or
   transitioning to unemployment. Analysing retrospective survey data for
   Germany (ALWA) using Fine and Gray models for competing risks, I show
   that a bridge into permanent employment most likely arises for
   medium-skill work. By contrast, the risk of a transition to unemployment
   is generally equal, but increases for employees performing low-and
   medium-skill tasks if local labour demand falls. Only high-skill jobs
   seem to be unaffected by the employment environment. The results
   indicate that debates concerning the function and consequences of
   temporary work must consider occupational characteristics. The selective
   distribution of transition probabilities and unemployment risks
   generates inequalities and increases the risk of labour market
   segmentation as employment polarization shifts employees towards low-and
   high-skill tasks.

AB Analysing survey data from the European Values Study, we investigate

   We argue that decreasing church attendance not only should enhance
   overall acceptance of these moral issues, but it should also lead to
   greater diversity in opinions on them. From our analyses, we can indeed
   conclude that declining levels of church attendance have been
   accompanied by greater permissiveness and increased diversity in
   attitudes towards abortion, divorce, and euthanasia. However, opinions
   about homosexuality hardly seem affected by developments in religiosity.
   Moreover, the trends in Western and Eastern Europe appear rather
   different. Eastern Europeans are far more conservative; in fact, no
   significant changes in church attendance levels (on average) were found
   there. The association between church attendance and moral views is in
   general weaker in Central and Eastern Europe than in Western Europe, and

   campaigning costs on candidates' equilibrium behaviors is in general
   ambiguous, requiring further specification of the details of the
   electoral situation, and (2) in general, equilibrium platform
   announcements are essentially independent of the location of the median
   voter's ideal point. In addition, the model is consistent with elections
   in which both, only one, or neither candidate actively campaigns, and,

   subsidies to public sector labor unions that lowered the costs of
   mobilizing their members to political action. Exploiting variation in
   the timing of laws across the states and using data on the political
   participation of public school teachers from 1956 to 2004, we find that
   the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law significantly boosted
   subsequent political participation among teachers. We also identify
   increased contact from organized groups seeking to mobilize teachers as
   a likely mechanism that explains this finding. These results have
   important implications for the current debate over collective bargaining
   rights and for our understanding of policy feedback, political parties
   and interest groups, and the bureaucracy.

AB How does America's high rate of incarceration shape political
   participation? Few studies have examined the direct effects of
   incarceration on patterns of political engagement. Answering this
   question is particularly relevant for the 93% of formerly incarcerated
   individuals who are eligible to vote. Drawing on new administrative data
   from Connecticut, we present evidence from a field experiment showing
   that a simple informational outreach campaign to released felons can
   recover a large proportion of the reduction in participation observed
   following incarceration. The treatment effect estimates imply that
   efforts to reintegrate released felons into the political process can
   substantially reduce the participatory consequences of incarceration.

AB The responsiveness of government agencies to elected officials is a
   central question in democratic governance. A key source of variation in
   responsiveness is agency structure. Yet scholars often view agencies as
   falling into broad structural categories (e.g., cabinet departments or
   independent commissions) or fixate on some features of design (e.g., for
   cause protections). I develop new estimates of structural independence
   based on new data on 50 different structural features of 321 federal
   agencies in the federal executive establishment. Using a Bayesian latent
   variable model, I estimate independence on two dimensions: limits on the
   appointment of key agency decision makers and limits on political review
   of agency policy. I illustrate the value of this new measure by using it
   to examine how structure affects political influence and how agency
   independence can vary over time.

AB Lawyers keep the gates of public justice institutions, particularly
   through their roles in formal procedures like hearings and trials. Yet,
   it is not clear what lawyers do in such quintessentially legal settings:
   conclusions from past research are bedeviled by a lack of clear theory
   and inconsistencies in research design. Conceptualizing litigation work
   in terms of professional expertise, I conduct a theoretically grounded
   synthesis of the findings of extant studies of lawyers' impact on civil
   case outcomes. Using an innovative combination of statistical
   techniquesmeta-analysis and nonparametric boundingthe present study
   transcends previous work to reveal a domain of consensus for lawyers'
   effect on case outcomes and to explore why this effect varies so greatly
   across past studies. For the types of cases researched to date,
   knowledge of substantive law explains surprisingly little of lawyers'
   advantage compared to lay people appearing unrepresented. Instead,
   lawyers' impact is greatest when they assist in navigating relatively
   simple (to lawyers) procedures and where their relational expertise
   helps courts follow their own rules. Findings for law generalize to
   other professions, where substantive and relational expertise may shape
   the conduct and consequences of professional work.

AB Recent scholarship highlights the importance of public discourse for the

   cultural products may shift discourse and thereby influence mobilization
   and political outcomes. This study investigates how activism against
   hydraulic fracturing (fracking) utilized cultural artifacts to influence
   public perceptions and effect change. A systematic analysis of Internet
   search data, social media postings, and newspaper articles allows us to
   identify how the documentary Gasland reshaped public discourse. We find
   that Gasland contributed not only to greater online searching about
   fracking, but also to increased social media chatter and heightened mass
   media coverage. Local screenings of Gasland contributed to anti-fracking
   mobilizations, which, in turn, affected the passage of local fracking
   moratoria in the Marcellus Shale states. These results have implications
   not only for understanding movement outcomes, but also for theory and
   research on media, the environment, and energy.

AB In the early twenty-first century, women continue to receive
   substantially less media coverage than men, despite women's much
   increased participation in public life. Media scholars argue that actors
   in news organizations skew news coverage in favor of men and
   male-related topics. However, no previous study has systematically
   examined whether such media bias exists beyond gender ratio imbalances
   in coverage that merely mirror societal-level structural and
   occupational gender inequalities. Using novel longitudinal data, we
   empirically isolate media-level factors and examine their effects on
   women's coverage rates in hundreds of newspapers. We find that
   societal-level inequalities are the dominant determinants of continued
   gender differences in coverage. The media focuses nearly exclusively on
   the highest strata of occupational and social hierarchies, in which
   women's representation has remained poor. We also find that women
   receive greater exposure in newspaper sections led by female editors, as
   well as in newspapers whose editorial boards have higher female
   representation. However, these differences appear to be mostly
   correlational, as women's coverage rates do not noticeably improve when
   male editors are replaced by female editors in a given newspaper.

AB Does the dissemination of organizational financial information shift
   power dynamics within workplaces, as evidenced by increasing workers'
   wages? That is the core question of this investigation. We utilize the
   2004 and 2011 series of the British Workplace Employment Relations
   Survey (WERS) to test whether employees who report that their managers
   disclose workplace financial data earn more than otherwise similar
   workers not privy to such information. Our findings suggest that
   disclosure results in higher wages for workers after adjusting for
   profit and productivity levels and a range of other workplace and worker
   characteristics. We estimate that workers who report their managers are
   very good at sharing organizational financial information outearn those
   who report their managers are very poor at financial disclosure by
   between 8 and 12 percent. We argue that disclosure is a key resource
   that reduces information asymmetries, thereby providing legitimacy to
   workers' claims in wage bargaining. More broadly, our focus on
   managerial transparency and its effects on worker earnings reveals a
   largely ignored characteristic of modern workplaces that has
   implications for contemporary trends in inequality and wage stagnation
   in Great Britain and other liberal market economies.

AB It is well known that family socioeconomic background influences
   childhood access to opportunities. Educational reforms that introduce
   new information about school quality may lead to increased inequality if
   families with more resources are better able to respond. However, these
   policies can also level the playing field for choice by equalizing
   disadvantaged families' access to information. This study assesses how a
   novel accountability system affected family enrollment decisions in the
   Chicago Public Schools by introducing new test performance information
   and consequences. We show that a substantial proportion of families
   responded by transferring out when their child's school was assigned
   probation. Poor families transferred children to other schools in the
   district, but at a lower rate than non-poor families, who were also more
   likely to leave for another district or enroll in private school. Most
   striking, we show that despite family response to the probation label,
   access to higher-performing schools changed very little under the new
   policy; students who left probation schools were the most likely of all
   transfer students to enroll in other low-performing schools in the
   district. Although new information changed families' behavior, it did
   not address contextual and resource-dependent factors that constrain the
   educational decisions of poor families.

AB Party leaders are the main actors controlling campaign strategies,
   policy agendas, and government formation in advanced parliamentary
   democracies. Little is known, however, about gender and party
   leadership. This article examines gendered leadership patterns across 71
   political parties in 11 parliamentary democracies between 1965 and 2013.
   It shows that men and women have different access to, and experiences
   in, party leadership and that these gendered political opportunity
   structures are shaped by parties' political performances. Women are more
   likely to initially come to power in minor opposition parties and those
   that are losing seat share. Once selected for the position, female
   leaders are more likely to retain office when their parties gain seats,
   but they are also more likely to leave the post when faced with an
   unfavorable trajectory. Together, these results demonstrate that
   prospective female leaders are playing by a different (and often more
   demanding) set of rules than their male counterparts.

AB What factors affect a scientist's choice of research problem?
   Qualitative research in the history and sociology of science suggests
   that this choice is patterned by an essential tension between productive
   tradition and risky innovation. We examine this tension through
   Bourdieu's field theory of science, and we explore it empirically by
   analyzing millions of biomedical abstracts from MEDLINE. We represent
   the evolving state of chemical knowledge with networks extracted from
   these abstracts. We then develop a typology of research strategies on
   these networks. Scientists can introduce novel chemicals and chemical
   relationships (innovation) or delve deeper into known ones (tradition).
   They can consolidate knowledge clusters or bridge them. The aggregate
   distribution of published strategies remains remarkably stable.
   High-risk innovation strategies are rare and reflect a growing focus on
   established knowledge. An innovative publication is more likely to
   achieve high impact than a conservative one, but the additional reward
   does not compensate for the risk of failing to publish. By studying
   prizewinners in biomedicine and chemistry, we show that occasional
   gambles for extraordinary impact are a compelling explanation for
   observed levels of risky innovation. Our analysis of the essential
   tension identifies institutional forces that sustain tradition and
   suggests policy interventions to foster innovation.

AB How do national institutional contexts mediate the global? This article
   aims to answer this question by analyzing screen translationthe
   translation of audiovisual materials like movies and television
   programsin four European countries: France, Italy, the Netherlands, and
   Poland. A cross-national, multi-method research project combining
   interviews, ethnography, and a small survey found considerable
   cross-national differences in translation norms and practices, sometimes
   leading to very different translated versions of the same product. The
   analysis shows how differences between national translation fields are
   produced and perpetuated by the interplay of institutional factors on
   four interdependent levels: technology, and the organizational,
   national, and transnational fields. On each level, various institutions
   are influential in shaping nationally specific translation norms and
   practices by producing institutional constraints or imposing specific
   meanings. I propose a model that explains the persistence of national
   translation systemsnot only from the logics of specific institutions,
   fields, or levelsbut by the feedback loops and interdependencies between
   institutions on various levels. This analysis has implications for the
   sociological understanding of globalization, the production of culture
   and media, cross-national comparative research, as well as institutional
   theory and the role of translation in sociological practice.

AB Organization scholars since Max Weber have argued that formal personnel

   bureaucratic reforms on managerial motivation. Drawing on
   self-perception and cognitive-dissonance theories, we contend that
   initiatives that engage managers in promoting diversityspecial
   recruitment and training programswill increase diversity. Drawing on
   job-autonomy and self-determination theories, we contend that
   initiatives that limit managerial discretion in hiring and promotionjob
   tests, performance evaluations, and grievance procedureswill elicit
   resistance and produce adverse effects. Drawing on transparency and
   accountability theories, we contend that bureaucratic reforms that
   increase transparency for job-seekers and hiring managersjob postings
   and job ladderswill have positive effects. Finally, drawing on
   accountability theory, we contend that monitoring by diversity managers
   and federal regulators will improve the effects of bureaucratic reforms.
   We examine the effects of personnel innovations on managerial diversity
   in 816 U.S. workplaces over 30 years. Our findings help explain the
   nation's slow progress in reducing job segregation and inequality. Some
   popular bureaucratic reforms thought to quell discrimination instead
   activate it. Some of the most effective reforms remain rare.

   India, South Africa, Italy and France have followed this path. Under the
   second, establishment insiders use the constitution to make strategic
   concessions to disrupt revolutionary movements before they can gain
   power. Britain provides paradigmatic examples. Under the third, ordinary
   citizens remain passive while political and social elites construct a
   new constitution. Spain, Japan and Germany provide variations on this
   theme. Different paths generate different legitimation problems, but the
   EU confronts a special difficulty. Since its members emerge out of three
   divergent pathways, they disagree about the nature of the union's
   constitutional problem, not merely its solution. Thus the EU confronts a
   cultural, not merely an economic, crisis.

   problem that clustered standard errors do not solve) and does not allow

   article demonstrates that a preferred methodological approach is to
   first estimate a standard multinomial choice model (conditional logit or
   mixed logit) of coalition formation, using government formation
   opportunities as the unit of analysis and potential governments as the
   choice alternatives. The probabilities of parties joining governments
   can then be recovered by simply summing the probabilities for the
   potential governments that contain each party. An empirical example
   shows how the substantive conclusions about a party's likelihood of
   entering office can change depending on the methodological approach
   taken.

   on the role of party organizational strategies in Brazil, where
   sociological cleavages are weak. All Brazilian parties post electoral
   gains by opening local branch offices, but only the Workers' Party (PT)
   manages to win voters' hearts and minds, cultivating mass partisan
   identification. This follows from its deliberate effort to use its local
   party organization to reach out to organized civil society - to mobilize
   the organized.' Results further indicate that the PT only gains partisan
   identifiers where civil society is organizationally dense. Together,
   this suggests that party strategy to cultivate partisanship is
   insufficient: pre-existing organizational networks must exist in civil
   society, meaning that top-down' and bottom-up' strategies are two sides

AB How does the risk of gridlock affect the type of legislative output? Do
   bureaucratic agents expand their activities when they can expect that
   the principals are unable to overrule them? This article introduces a
   novel approach for calculating the risk of gridlock in bicameral
   legislatures in order to estimate its impact on bureaucratic activities,
   combining data on all secondary and tertiary acts of the European Union
   (EU) from 1983 to 2009. The findings reveal that bureaucratic activities
   expand when the risk of gridlock increases and an overruling of tertiary
   acts becomes less likely. This may sustain the EU's overall
   decision-making productivity, but its bureaucratic nature may raise
   further questions about democratic legitimacy and principal-agent
   problems in the representation of interests.

AB Why do states create overlapping international institutions? This
   practice presents a puzzle: conventional wisdom suggests that states
   should use existing institutions to minimize the transaction costs of
   co-operation. This article proposes a bargaining approach to explain the
   de novo creation of overlapping international institutions. In this
   model, a dissatisfied challenger' state threatens to create a new
   institution, and a defender' state can propose to reform the currently
   focal institution. Overlapping institutions are created when the
   currently focal institution is (1) captured by interests opposed to the
   challenger and (2) domestic political pressure to abandon the status quo
   is intense. Similar to models of deterrence, the expectation that the
   new institution garners support among third parties is irrelevant for
   the equilibrium likelihood of de novo creation. A comparative analysis
   of international bargaining over energy, whaling and intellectual
   property rights provides empirical evidence.

   justified for understanding civilian targeting: whether a European state
   is fighting a non-European state. This article replicates and extends
   three recent statistical analyses - Downes; Valentino, Huth and Croco;
   and Morrow - of civilian targeting by including a variable capturing
   whether a European state fought a non-European state. The study finds
   that civilian targeting, and non compliance with the law of war more

   between religious groups, whether in terms of social conservatism,
   economic leftism or national identity. Instead, particular denominations
   are associated with parties that represented those denominational groups
   in the early twentieth century when social cleavages were frozen' within
   the system. The main mechanism underpinning these divisions is parental

AB Most social network studies following Granovetter's (1985) vision of
   embeddedness have either focused on instrumental relations or lumped
   instrumentality and sentimentality together. This study seeks to clarify
   whether social relations that primarily build on sentimentality can
   impact economic action. Based on the context of Chinese market
   transition, this paper found that general managers that had
   affection-based social circles, that is, small groups in which people
   enjoy being together, were more likely to start a private firm after
   being laid off. In contrast, business-based social circles, defined as
   small groups mainly formed on business interests, did not have a
   significant interactive effect with layoff. These findings are
   consistent with the argument that affection-based social circles help
   managers experiencing job loss maintain a stable and positive
   self-identity, and that these circles also exert less constraint over
   radical career change.

   to it in terms of modifying their educational expectations. Applying a
   difference-in-differences approach to the National Educational
   Longitudinal Study of 1988, I find that being placed in an advanced or

AB This contribution provides a long-term assessment of intergenerational
   social mobility trends in the United States across the 20th and early
   21st centuries and assesses the determinants of those trends. In
   particular, we study how educational expansion has contributed to the
   observed changes in mobility opportunities for men across cohorts.
   Drawing on recently developed decomposition methods, we empirically
   identify the contribution of each of the multiple channels through which
   changing rates of educational participation shape mobility trends. We
   find that a modest but gradual increase in social class mobility can
   nearly exclusively be ascribed to an interaction known as the
   compositional effect, according to which the direct influence of social
   class backgrounds on social class destinations is lower among the
   growing number of individuals attaining higher levels of education. This
   dominant role of the compositional effect is also due to the fact that,
   despite pronounced changes in the distribution of education, class
   inequality in education has remained stable while class returns to
   education have shown no consistent trend. Our analyses also provide a
   cautionary tale about mistaking increasing levels of social class
   mobility for a general trend toward more fluidity in the United States.
   The impact of parental education on son's educational and class
   attainment has grown or remained stable, respectively. Here, the
   compositional effect pertaining to the direct association between
   parental education and son's class attainment counteracts a long-term
   trend of increasing inequality in educational attainment tied to
   parents' education.

AB Between 1790 and 1952, naturalization was reserved primarily for "free
   white persons." Asian immigrants were deemed non-white and racially
   ineligible for citizenship by legislation and the courts. European
   immigrants and, importantly, Mexican immigrants were considered white by
   law and eligible for naturalization. Yet, few Mexicans acquired US
   citizenship. By 1930, only 9 percent of Mexican men had naturalized,
   compared to 60 percent of southern and eastern Europeans and 80 percent
   of northern and western Europeans. If Mexicans were legally white, why
   did they rarely acquire citizenship in the early decades of the 20th
   century? We go beyond analyses focused on formal law or individual-level
   determinants to underscore the importance of region and non-white social
   status in influencing naturalization. Using 1930 US Census microfile
   data, we find that while individual characteristics (e.g., length of
   residence and literacy) explain some of the gulf in citizenship, the
   context of reception mattered nearly as much. Even if Mexicans were
   "white by law," they were often judged non-white in practice, which
   significantly decreased their likelihood of naturalizing. Moreover, the
   more welcoming political and social climate of the Northeast and
   Midwest, where most European migrants lived, facilitated their
   acquisition of American citizenship.

AB High rates of Hispanic fertility raise an important question: Do

   and disadvantaged? To address this question, we link the newborn infants
   identified with the new fertility question in the 2006-2010 American
   Community Survey (ACS) to the poverty status of mothers. Our results
   document the disproportionately large share (40 percent) of Hispanic
   babies who are born into poverty. The prospect of poverty is especially
   high in new Hispanic destinations, especially those in rural areas. For
   Hispanic newborn babies, poverty cannot be reduced to supply-side
   explanations that emphasize maladaptive behavioral decision-making of
   parents, that is, nonmarital or teen childbearing, low educational
   attainment, acquisition of English language skills, or other dimensions
   of human capital. Hispanics in new destinations often start well behind
   the starting line-in poverty and with limited opportunities for upward
   mobility and an inadequate welfare safety net. The recent concentration
   of Hispanic poverty in new immigrant destinations portends continuing
   intergenerational inequality as today's newborn infants make their way

AB The contemporary relevance of the concept of "race" has been
   increasingly questioned around the world. In Europe, researchers often
   look with skepticism at the US emphasis on race, instead highlighting
   the capacity of culture, especially religion, to explain native
   opposition to immigrants. Using two distinct data sets, I examine
   self-reports of discrimination among immigrants in Spain, where elites
   have long denied racial differences, to understand how the reported
   salience of boundaries based on race, nationality, and religion change
   with acculturation. I find that reports of both nationality-and
   race-based discrimination are relatively common for newcomers, while
   reports of religion-based discrimination are quite rare. Yet, unlike
   reports of racial discrimination, reports of nationality discrimination
   decrease over time as immigrants' cultural differences decline due to
   their cultural assimilation. For second-generation immigrants,
   especially non-Europeans, race replaces nationality as the primary
   explanation for discrimination experiences and reports of religious
   discrimination grow even more infrequent. I conclude that, from the
   perspective of immigrants, the recent transformation of Spain into a new
   immigrant destination has gone hand in hand with the emergence of race
   as the main symbolic boundary marginalizing non-European immigrants in
   Spain.

AB Increasing numbers of independent women labor migrants leave countries
   in the Global South every year to work overseas. However, our
   understanding of how exactly gender and migration intersect at the
   decision-making moment is still inadequate. The new economics of labor
   migration (NELM) argument that individual migration is a household-level
   decision has been criticized by feminist scholars for ignoring the
   gendered social norms and inequitable intra-household power distribution
   that can make it difficult for prospective independent female labor
   migrants to leave their homes to work overseas. To reconcile NELM with
   gender reality, I propose an explicitly gendered, "negotiated migration
   model" that separates the pre-migratory process into three parts: an
   individual-level aspiration, the household-/family-level negotiation,
   and only then, the migration decision. The intermediate negotiation
   phase is a dynamic, two-sided, discursive site where both the aspiring
   migrant and her relatives engage in gendering practices and gender
   performances to bolster their respective positions. Interviews with 139
   Filipino migrant domestic workers reveal that successful female migrants
   win their families' support by coopting gendered scripts prevalent in
   Philippine society. Rather than attempting to "undo" gender, these women
   reframe their migration aspirations as a duty, rather than a right, to
   migrate, and a logical extension of their traditional, supporting roles
   as daughters, wives, sisters, and/or mothers. Thus, even though these
   women migrants break gender barriers when it comes to their independent
   labor migration, they do so by "doing," rather than "undoing," gender.

AB Poverty concentration reflects long-standing inequalities between
   neighborhoods in the United States. As the poverty concentration
   paradigm gained traction among policymakers and social scientists,
   assisted housing policy was overhauled. New assisted housing programs
   introduced since 1970 have dramatically reduced the geographic
   concentration of assisted housing units, changing the residential
   location of many low-income residents. Was this intervention in the
   housing market enough to reduce poverty concentration? Using national
   longitudinal data, I find that the deconcentration of assisted housing
   from 1977 to 2008 only modestly reduced poverty concentration in the 100
   largest metropolitan areas. The results are driven by the
   deconcentration of assisted housing after 2000, when policies had a
   greater focus on dispersal of assisted housing to low-poverty
   neighborhoods. My results suggest that even a substantial shift in
   housing policy cannot make great strides in deconcentrating poverty
   given the existing landscape of durable urban inequality. Assisted
   housing policy exists alongside many other structural forces that
   cluster poor residents in neighborhoods, and these factors may limit its
   ability to reduce poverty concentration. Moreover, new housing programs
   rely on the private market to determine the location of assisted units,
   and the enduring place hierarchy among neighborhoods may influence both
   where assisted housing is located and its effect on the residential
   choices of non-assisted residents in ways that undermine poverty
   deconcentration.

AB What is the relationship between unionization and job satisfaction?
   Despite a great deal of research over several decades, the answer to
   this question is still uncertain. In contrast to earlier work, which
   analyzed mostly data from individual companies or countries, we examine
   the association between union membership and job satisfaction in a
   cross-national perspective. We therefore combine large-scale survey data
   with country-level information about union and labor-market
   characteristics. Our multilevel approach allows us to examine whether
   and why the unionization-job satisfaction relationship varies across
   countries. The main finding of our analyses is that the relationship
   between union membership and job satisfaction varies across countries
   and that unions matter only for certain aspects of job
   satisfaction-those that can more readily be changed by unions. This
   effect, moreover, is contingent on countries' industrial relations
   systems, in particular union density, bargaining coverage, and the
   centralization of bargaining agreements. Taken together, our results
   show that in order to understand how unionization influences job
   satisfaction, it is important to distinguish between the various aspects
   of job satisfaction and to consider the larger context in which unions
   operate.

AB Americans have become increasingly tolerant of controversial outgroups
   in results from the nationally representative General Social Survey
   (1972-2012, N = 35,048). Specifically, adults in the 2010s (versus the
   1970s and 1980s) were more likely to agree that Communists, homosexuals,
   the anti-religious, militarists, and those believing Blacks are
   genetically inferior should be allowed to give a public speech, teach at
   a college, or have a book in a local library. Cross-classification
   hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses separating the effects of
   time period, cohort/generation, and age show that these trends were
   driven by both a linear time period effect and a curvilinear cohort
   effect, with those born in the late 1940s (Boomers) the most tolerant
   when age and time period were controlled. Tolerance of homosexuals
   increased the most, and tolerance of racists the least. The increase in
   tolerance is positively correlated with higher levels of education and
   individualistic attitudes, including rejecting traditional social rules,
   but is negatively correlated with changes in empathy.

AB Do people attribute emotions differently to members of various social
   groups? If so, do these differences have any bearing on formal and
   informal forms of social recognition? Using data from a nationally
   representative survey experiment, we examine whether American
   heterosexuals differentially attribute love to lesbian, gay, and
   heterosexual couples. We also examine the relationship between how in
   love lesbian, gay, and heterosexual couples are perceived to be and
   attitudes toward (1) granting them partnership benefits (formal rights);
   (2) the acceptability of their public displays of affection (informal
   privileges); and (3) marriage. Three main findings suggest that
   heterosexuals differentially attribute love to different types of
   romantic couples and that these differences are related to willingness
   to grant social recognition. First, gay couples are viewed as less
   loving than both heterosexual and lesbian couples; lesbian couples are
   seen as equally loving as heterosexual couples. Second, perceptions of
   love are related to willingness to grant social recognition. Third,
   perceptions of love matter more for gay and, to a lesser extent, lesbian
   couples than for heterosexual couples regarding informal privileges and
   marriage. In contrast, love matters equally for same-sex and
   heterosexual couples regarding formal rights. The results show that gay
   couples are penalized most in terms of perceptions of love and social
   recognition, whereas lesbians occupy a liminal space between
   heterosexual and gay couples. Collectively, these findings suggest that
   sexual identity and gender shape emotional attributions, which in turn
   play a key role in explaining inequalities that same-sex couples face.

AB This article assesses the effects of formal mentoring on workplace
   networks. It also provides conceptual clarity and empirical evidence on
   expected gender differences in the effects of such programs. Qualitative
   interviews with 40 past participants in a formal mentoring program at a
   software laboratory in Beijing, China, provide insight into the core
   mechanisms by which such programs produce network change: access to
   organizational elites, participation in semiformal foci, enhanced social
   skills, and legitimacy-enhancing signals. These mechanisms are theorized
   to lead to an expansion in proteges' networks, relative to those of
   non-participants in formal mentoring. Legitimacy-enhancing signals are
   theorized to enable female proteges to derive greater network benefit
   from formal mentoring than their male counterparts. Empirical support
   for these propositions comes from a longitudinal quasi-experiment
   involving 75 employees who experienced the treatment of formal mentoring
   and 64 employees in a matched control group. A second empirical
   strategy, which exploits exogenous variation in the timing of treatment
   and enables a comparison of the post-program networks of one treated
   group to the pre-program networks of another treated group, provides
   corroborating support. These findings contribute to research on the
   efficacy of formal mentoring, gender and workplace networks, and the
   cumulative advantage or disadvantage that can arise from network change.

AB Partnership ties shape friendship networks through different social
   forces. First, partnership ties drive clustering in friendship networks:
   individuals who are in a partnership tend to have common friends and
   befriend other couples. Second, partnership ties influence the level of
   homophily in these emerging friendship clusters. Partners tend to be
   similar in a number of attributes (homogamy). If one partner selects
   friends based on preferences for homophily, then the other partner may
   befriend the same person regardless of whether they also have homophilic
   preferences. Thus, two homophilic ties emerge based on a single
   partner's preferences. This amplification of homophily can be observed
   in many attributes (e.g., ethnicity, religion, age). Gender homophily,
   however, may be de-amplified, as the gender of partners differs in
   heterosexual partnerships. In our study, we follow dynamic friendship
   formation among 126 individuals and their cohabiting partners in a
   university-related graduate housing community over a period of nine
   months (N = 2,250 self-reported friendship relations). We find that
   partnership ties strongly shape the dynamic process of friendship
   formation. They are a main driver of local network clustering and
   explain a striking amount of homophily.

AB Using both cross-sectional and panel data, this article revisits the
   evolution of the financial premium between 1970 and 2011 with a
   distributional approach. I report that above-market compensation was
   present in the finance sector in the 1970s, but concentrated mostly at
   the bottom of the earnings distribution. The financial premium observed
   since the 1980s, however, is largely driven by excessive compensation at
   the top, a development that increasingly contributes to the national
   concentration of earnings. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that the
   financial premium for top earners remained robust in the early 2000s,
   when deregulation slowed down, and in the aftermath of the recent
   financial meltdown. These findings are inconsistent with the account
   that the earnings differential is driven by unobserved skill difference
   and demand shocks but supportive of the institutional account of rising
   inequality.

AB This article investigates how firms in competitive markets use external
   examples to assess the value of novel practices, focusing on the
   substantively important case of collateralized debt obligation (CDO)
   underwriting among US investment and commercial banks, 1996-2007.
   Diffusion researchers have struggled to adjudicate between competing
   mechanisms of social contagion, including imitation and learning. I use
   event-history methods to examine how banks responded to the activities
   and results of other CDO underwriters. I show that banks learned
   superstitiously from the share price performance of other CDO
   underwriters; as the popularity of CDO underwriting increased, banks
   became even more attentive to confirmatory evidence on this dimension.
   These findings suggest important refinements to theories of social
   contagion, especially neoinstitutional theory. By focusing on ordinary
   organizational processes in an extraordinary context, I uncover an
   alternative explanation for the rise of complex securitization, with
   implications for current understandings of the credit crisis.

AB In this article, I develop and empirically test the theoretical argument
   that widely shared cultural beliefs about men's and women's abilities in
   entrepreneurship (i.e., "gender status beliefs") systematically
   influence the social interactions during which an entrepreneur,
   particularly an innovative entrepreneur, seeks support from potential
   stakeholders for his or her new organization. To evaluate this argument,
   I conducted three experimental studies in the United Kingdom and the
   United States in which student participants were asked to evaluate the
   profiles of two entrepreneurs and to make investment decisions for each.
   The studies manipulated the gender of the entrepreneur and the
   innovativeness of the business plan. The main finding is consistent
   across studies: gender status beliefs disadvantage typical women
   entrepreneurs vis-a-vis their male counterparts, but innovation in a
   business model has a stronger and more positive impact on ratings of
   women's entrepreneurial ability and overall support for their business
   ideas than it does for men's. However, the strength of these patterns
   varies significantly depending on the societal and industry context of
   the new venture in question. Findings indicate that gender status
   beliefs can be understood as an important "demand-side" mechanism
   contributing to gender inequality in aggregate entrepreneurship rates
   and a micro-level factor affecting the likelihood that a new and novel
   organization will emerge and survive.

AB Millions of families across the United States are evicted each year.
   Yet, we know next to nothing about the impact eviction has on their
   lives. Focusing on low-income urban mothers, a population at high risk
   of eviction, this study is among the first to examine rigorously the
   consequences of involuntary displacement from housing. Applying two
   methods of propensity score analyses to data from a national survey, we
   find that eviction has negative effects on mothers in multiple domains.
   Compared to matched mothers who were not evicted, mothers who were
   evicted in the previous year experienced more material hardship, were
   more likely to suffer from depression, reported worse health for
   themselves and their children, and reported more parenting stress. Some
   evidence suggests that at least two years after their eviction, mothers
   still experienced significantly higher rates of material hardship and
   depression than peers.

   transmitted infection (STI). The government's HIV curriculum, which
   stresses abstinence until marriage, does not reduce pregnancy or STI.
   Both programs combined reduce STI more, but cut dropout and pregnancy
   less, than education subsidies alone. These results are inconsistent
   with a model of schooling and sexual behavior in which both pregnancy
   and STI are determined by one factor (unprotected sex), but consistent
   with a two-factor model in which choices between committed and casual
   relationships also affect these outcomes.

AB Repeated interaction and social networks are commonly considered viable
   solutions to collective action problems. This article identifies and
   systematically measures four general mechanismsthat is, generalized
   altruism, group solidarity, reciprocity, and the threat of
   sanctioningand tests which of them brings about cooperation in the
   context of Ugandan producer organizations. Using an innovative
   methodological framework that combines lab-in-the-field experiments with
   survey interviews and complete social networks data, the article goes
   beyond the assessment of a relationship between social networks and
   collective outcomes to study the mechanisms that favor cooperative
   behavior. The article first establishes a positive relationship between
   position in the network structure and propensity to cooperate in the
   producer organization and then uses farmers' behavior in dictator and
   public goods games to test different mechanisms that may account for
   such a relationship. Results show that cooperation is induced by
   patterns of reciprocity that emerge through repeated interaction rather
   than other-regarding preferences like altruism or group solidarity.

AB In this study, the author uses a nationally representative survey to
   examine the relationship(s) between skin tone, discrimination, and
   health among African-Americans. He finds that skin tone is a significant
   predictor of multiple forms of perceived discrimination (including
   perceived skin color discrimination from whites and blacks) and, in
   turn, these forms of perceived discrimination are significant predictors
   of key health outcomes, such as depression and self-rated mental and
   physical health. Intraracial health differences related to skin tone
   (and discrimination) often rival or even exceed disparities between
   blacks and whites as a whole. The author also finds that self-reported
   skin tone, conceptualized as a form of embodied social status, is a
   stronger predictor of perceived discrimination than interviewer-rated
   skin tone. He discusses the implications of these findings for the study
   of ethnoracial health disparities and highlights the utility of
   cognitive and multidimensional approaches to ethnoracial and social
   inequality.

AB Through the analysis of conversational interaction and clinical notes,
   this article develops conceptual linkages between the Goffmanian concept
   of face and the psychoanalytic and psychiatric understandings of
   narcissism. Self-cathexisthe investment of libidinal emotion to the
   image of selfis a key issue both for Goffman and in psychoanalytic
   studies of narcissism. For Goffman, the self and its cathexis are
   inherently fragile interactional achievements, whereas for
   psychoanalysts such as Kernberg and Kohut, they are relatively stable
   intrapsychic structures. An application of Goffman's theory to
   narcissistic personality disorders suggests that pathological narcissism
   involves the isolation of the person's self-image from interactional
   practices and a consequent inability to benefit from face work in
   ordinary social encounters. Clinical experience suggests revisions to
   the theory of face work: there is a biographical continuity in a
   person's experience of face, and successful participation in face work
   is made possible by the psychic capacity of playful orientation to one's
   own and others' narcissistic illusions. Such playful orientation is
   manifested through the interactional practices of role distancing.

AB The authors argue that group threat is a key driver of the adoption of
   new and controversial policies. Conceptualizing threat in spatial terms,
   they argue that group threat is activated through the joint occurrence
   of (1) proximity to threatening groups and (2) the population density of
   threatened groups. By analyzing the adoption of county and state dry
   laws banning alcohol from 1890 to 1919, they first show that prohibition
   victories were driven by the relative strength of supportive
   constituencies such as native whites and rural residents, vis-a-vis
   opponents such as Irish, Italian, or German immigrants or Catholics.
   Second, they show that threat contributed to prohibition victories:
   counties bordering large immigrant or urban populations, which did not
   themselves contain similar populations, were more likely to adopt dry
   laws. Threat arises primarily from interactions between spatially
   proximate units at the local level, and therefore higher-level policy
   change is not reducible to the variables driving local policy.

   women's attachment to the labor market, focusing specifically on policy
   feedback on women's subjective work commitment. They utilize a
   quasi-experimental design to identify normative policy effects from
   changes in mothers' work commitment in conjunction with two policy
   changes that significantly extended the length of statutory parental
   leave entitlements in Germany. Using unique survey data from the German
   Socio-Economic Panel and difference-in-differences, triple-differenced,
   and instrumental variables estimators for panel data, they obtain
   consistent empirical evidence that increasing generosity of leave
   entitlements led to a decline in mothers' work commitment in both East
   and West Germany. They also probe potential mediating mechanisms and
   find strong evidence for role exposure and norm setting effects.
   Finally, they demonstrate that policy-induced shifts in mothers'
   preferences have contributed to retarding women's labor force
   participation after childbirth in Germany, especially as far as mothers'
   return to full-time employment is concerned.

   analysis of 3,387 articles and opinion pieces in leading newspapers from
   eight Western countries, compiled into the Darfur Media Dataset, as well
   as in-depth interviews to assess how media frame violence in the Darfur
   region of Sudan. Overall, it finds that UN Security Council and
   International Criminal Court interventions increase representations of
   mass violence as crime in all countries under investigation, although
   each country applies the crime frame at a different level. Reporting
   suffering and categorizing the violence as genocide also varies across
   countries. Comparative case studies identify country specific structural
   and cultural forces that appear to account for these differences.
   Multilevel multivariate analyses confirm the explanatory power of
   cultural sensitivities and policy practices, while individual- and
   organization-level factors, such as reporters' gender and the
   newspapers' ideological orientation, also have explanatory power.

AB Electoral forensics involves examining election results for anomalies to
   efficiently identify patterns indicative of electoral irregularities.
   However, there is disagreement about which, if any, forensics tool is
   most effective at identifying fraud, and there is no method for
   integrating multiple tools. Moreover, forensic efforts have failed to
   systematically take advantage of country-specific details that might aid
   in diagnosing fraud. We deploy a Bayesian additive regression trees
   (BART) model-a machine-learning technique-on a large cross-national data
   set to explore the dense network of potential relationships between
   various forensic indicators of anomalies and electoral fraud risk
   factors, on the one hand, and the likelihood of fraud, on the other.
   This approach allows us to arbitrate between the relative importance of
   different forensic and contextual features for identifying electoral
   fraud and results in a diagnostic tool that can be relatively easily
   implemented in cross-national research.

AB Digit-based election forensics (DBEF) typically relies on null
   hypothesis significance testing, with undesirable effects on substantive
   conclusions. This article proposes an alternative free of this problem.
   It rests on decomposing the observed numeral distribution into the "no
   fraud" and "fraud" latent classes, by finding the smallest fraction of
   numerals that needs to be either removed or reallocated to achieve a
   perfect fit of the "no fraud" model. The size of this fraction can be
   interpreted as a measure of fraudulence. Both alternatives are special
   cases of measures of model fit-the mu* mixture index of fit and the
   Delta dissimilarity index, respectively. Furthermore, independently of
   the latent class framework, the distributional assumptions of DBEF can
   be relaxed in some contexts. Independently or jointly, the latent class
   framework and the relaxed distributional assumptions allow us to dissect
   the observed distributions using models more flexible than those of
   existing DBEF. Reanalysis of Beber and Scacco's ( 2012) data shows that
   the approach can lead to new substantive conclusions.

AB Mass election predictions are increasingly used by election forecasters
   and public opinion scholars. While they are potentially powerful tools
   for answering a variety of social science questions, existing measures
   are limited in that they ask about victors rather than voteshares. We
   show that asking survey respondents to predict voteshares is a viable
   and superior alternative to asking them to predict winners. After
   showing respondents can make sensible quantitative predictions, we
   demonstrate how traditional qualitative forecasts lead to mistaken
   inferences. In particular, qualitative predictions vastly overstate the
   degree of partisan bias in election forecasts, and lead to wrong
   conclusions regarding how political knowledge exacerbates this bias. We
   also show how election predictions can aid in the use of elections as
   natural experiments, using the effect of the 2012 election on partisan
   economic perceptions as an example. Our results have implications for
   multiple constituencies, from methodologists and pollsters to political
   scientists and interdisciplinary scholars of collective intelligence.

AB Onsets of binary events are often of interest to political scientists,
   whether they be regime changes, the occurrence of civil war, or the
   signing of bilateral agreements, to name a few. Often researchers
   transform the binary event outcome of interest, by setting ongoing years
   to zero, to create a variable which measures the onset of the event.
   While this may seem an intuitive way to go about estimating models where
   onset is the outcome of interest, it results in two problems that can
   affect substantive inferences. First, it creates two qualitatively
   different meanings for a unit time period to have a zero, which
   estimators are unable to "know." Second, it ignores the possibility that
   variables may have differing effects upon binary event onsets and
   durations. This article explores how much this transformation can harm
   our substantive inferences by analytically demonstrating the resulting
   bias and the use of Monte Carlo experiments, as well as offering
   recommendations to avoid these problems. I also conduct a sensitivity
   analysis on the determinants of civil war onset to examine how
   substantive inferences are affected by this issue. In doing so, I find
   that there is considerable difference in the size of estimated
   coefficients and whether a variable is considered a robust determinant
   of civil war.

AB Many variables crucial to the social sciences are not directly observed
   but instead are latent and measured indirectly. When an external
   variable of interest affects this measurement, estimates of its
   relationship with the latent variable will then be biased. Such
   violations of "measurement invariance" may, for example, confound true
   differences across countries in postmaterialism with measurement
   differences. To deal with this problem, researchers commonly aim at
   "partial measurement invariance"; that is, to account for those
   differences that may be present and important. To evaluate this
   importance directly through sensitivity analysis, the "EPC-interest" was
   recently introduced for continuous data. However, latent variable models
   in the social sciences often use categorical data. The current paper
   therefore extends the EPC-interest to latent variable models for
   categorical data and demonstrates its use in example analyses of U.S.
   Senate votes as well as respondent rankings of postmaterialism values in
   the World Values Study.

   Many analyses in the social sciences fail to account for the fact that

   correlated across these dyads. We propose a non-parametric,
   sandwich-type robust variance estimator for linear regression to account
   for such clustering in dyadic data. We enumerate conditions for
   estimator consistency. We also extend our results to repeated and
   weighted observations, including directed dyads and longitudinal data,

   logistic regression. We examine empirical performance with simulations

AB The various methodological techniques that fall under the umbrella
   description of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) are increasingly
   popular for modeling causal complexity and necessary or sufficient
   conditions in medium-N settings. Because QCA methods are not designed as
   statistical techniques, however, there is no way to assess the
   probability that the patterns they uncover are the result of chance.
   Moreover, the implications of the multiple hypothesis tests inherent in
   these techniques for the false positive rate of the results are not
   widely understood. This article fills both gaps by tailoring a simple
   permutation test to the needs of QCA users and adjusting the Type I
   error rate of the test to take into account the multiple hypothesis
   tests inherent in QCA. An empirical application-a reexamination of a
   study of protest-movement success in the Arab Spring-highlights the need
   for such a test by showing that even very strong QCA results may

   across 20 different nonlinear tariff schedules. I find that the free
   allowance acts as a lump-sum subsidy, without large effects on water
   consumption. However, it is possible to reallocate the current subsidy
   to form an optimal tariff without a free allowance, which would increase
   welfare while leaving the water provider's profit unchanged. This
   optimal tariff would also reduce the number of households consuming low

AB There is a widely held view within the general public that large
   corporations should act in the interests of a broader group of agents
   than just their shareholders (the stakeholder view). This paper presents
   a framework where this idea can be justified. The point of departure is
   the observation that a large firm typically faces endogenous risks that
   may have a significant impact on the workers it employs and the
   consumers it serves. These risks generate externalities on these
   stakeholders which are not internalized by shareholders. As a result, in
   the competitive equilibrium, there is under-investment in the prevention
   of these risks. We suggest that this under-investment problem can be
   alleviated if firms are instructed to maximize the total welfare of
   their stakeholders rather than shareholder value alone (stakeholder
   equilibrium). The stakeholder equilibrium can be implemented by
   introducing new property rights (employee rights and consumer rights)
   and instructing managers to maximize the total value of the firm (the
   value of these rights plus shareholder value). If there is only one
   firm, the stakeholder equilibrium is Pareto optimal. However, this is
   not true with more than one firm and/or heterogeneous agents, which
   illustrates some of the limits of the stakeholder model.

   whether or not the agents learn efficiently depends on the topology of

   transitions may depend on actions, types may be correlated, and values
   may be interdependent. The focus is on equilibria in which players
   report truthfully. The characterization generalizes that for repeated

   With independent private values, the restriction to truthful equilibria
   is without loss, except for the punishment level: if players withhold
   their information during punishment-like phases, a folk theorem obtains.

AB We consider a large market where auctioneers with private reservation
   values compete for bidders by announcing cheap-talk messages. If
   auctioneers run efficient first-price auctions, then there always exists
   an equilibrium in which each auctioneer truthfully reveals her type. The
   equilibrium is constrained efficient, assigning more bidders to
   auctioneers with larger gains from trade. The choice of the trading
   mechanism is crucial for the result. Most notably, the use of
   second-price auctions (equivalently, ex post bidding) leads to the
   nonexistence of any informative equilibrium. We examine the robustness
   of our finding in various dimensions, including finite markets and
   equilibrium selection.

AB We argue that poverty can perpetuate itself by undermining the capacity
   for self-control. In line with a distinguished psychological literature,
   we consider modes of self-control that involve the self-imposed use of
   contingent punishments and rewards. We study settings in which consumers
   with quasi-hyperbolic preferences confront an otherwise standard
   intertemporal allocation problem with credit constraints. Our main
   result demonstrates that low initial assets can limit self-control,
   trapping people in poverty, while individuals with high initial assets
   can accumulate indefinitely. Thus, even temporary policies that initiate
   accumulation among the poor may be effective. We examine implications
   concerning the effect of access to credit on saving, the demand for
   commitment devices, the design of financial accounts to promote
   accumulation, and the variation of the marginal propensity to consume
   across income from different sources. We also explore the nature of
   optimal self-control, demonstrating that it has a simple and
   behaviorally plausible structure that is immune to self-renegotiation.

AB We propose a method to set identify bounds on the sharing rule for a
   general collective household consumption model. Unlike the effects of
   distribution factors, the level of the sharing rule cannot be uniquely
   identified without strong assumptions on preferences across households.
   Our new results show that, though not point identified without these
   assumptions, strong bounds on the sharing rule can be obtained. We get
   these bounds by applying revealed preference restrictions implied by the
   collective model to the household's continuous aggregate demand
   functions. We obtain informative bounds even if nothing is known about
   whether each good is public, private, or assignable within the
   household, though having such information tightens the bounds. We apply
   our method to US PSID data, obtaining narrow bounds that yield useful
   conclusions regarding the effects of income and wages on intrahousehold
   resource sharing, and on the prevalence of individual (as opposed to
   household level) poverty.

AB This paper makes the following original contributions to the literature.
   (i) We develop a simpler analytical characterization and numerical
   algorithm for Bayesian inference in structural vector autoregressions
   (VARs) that can be used for models that are overidentified,
   just-identified, or underidentified. (ii) We analyze the asymptotic
   properties of Bayesian inference and show that in the underidentified
   case, the asymptotic posterior distribution of contemporaneous
   coefficients in an n-variable VAR is confined to the set of values that
   orthogonalize the population variance-covariance matrix of ordinary
   least squares residuals, with the height of the posterior proportional
   to the height of the prior at any point within that set. For example, in
   a bivariate VAR for supply and demand identified solely by sign
   restrictions, if the population correlation between the VAR residuals is
   positive, then even if one has available an infinite sample of data, any
   inference about the demand elasticity is coming exclusively from the
   prior distribution. (iii) We provide analytical characterizations of the
   informative prior distributions for impulse-response functions that are
   implicit in the traditional sign-restriction approach to VARs, and we
   note, as a special case of result (ii), that the influence of these
   priors does not vanish asymptotically. (iv) We illustrate how Bayesian
   inference with informative priors can be both a strict generalization
   and an unambiguous improvement over frequentist inference in
   just-identified models. (v) We propose that researchers need to
   explicitly acknowledge and defend the role of prior beliefs in
   influencing structural conclusions and we illustrate how this could be
   done using a simple model of the U.S. labor market.

AB A crucial factor in differentiation between existing approaches to
   nationalism and cosmopolitanism is the positioning of these approaches
   within a continuum between particularism and universalism, based on
   their understanding of space and time. However, this also poses a major
   difficulty in studying practices of nationalism and cosmopolitanism:
   Reducing these practices to a position within the
   particularism/universalism continuum establishes different forms of
   nationalism and cosmopolitanism as 'order of things', through which any
   practice is projected as an approximation or a distortion of this ideal
   'order'. Such a projection tells more about the researchers' own
   theoretical commitments than the participants' practices. This article
   utilizes some conceptual tools from Actor-Network Theory in an effort to
   establish a sketch for an alternative projection to study practices of
   nationalism and cosmopolitanism, which will give the participants an
   opportunity to perform their own time and space, instead of reducing
   them to placeholders of an already determined position, a priori
   identified by researchers.

AB The paper seeks to present a world regional approach to the analysis of
   modernity and in doing so it also aims to make a contribution to
   comparative sociology and social theory. It is argued that world regions
   are the most suitable entry-point for comparing different
   socio-political constellations of our time, preferable to continents,
   civilizations and nation-states. However, a world regional foundation on
   its own is insufficient, due to the internal plurality and historically
   changing forms of world regions, and therefore needs to be accompanied
   by a concept that provides some degree of coherence within world regions
   and a tool for comparison with other world regions. The notion of
   modernity offers this level of generality while at the same time
   allowing for variety in its historical forms. Six main formations of
   modernity are identified, of which the European model was the first one
   and often a cultural reference for many other parts of the world. The
   thesis is that in the present day the most important developments are in
   the Asian and Latin American varieties, which unlike Europe are
   witnessing major historical transformation. Decisive in all of this is
   the question of democratization in the shaping of social imaginaries.
   Beginning with the problem of how to define the specificity of Europe,
   the paper provides an exploratory analysis of some of the salient
   considerations around a number of world regions, their formations of
   modernity, and the extent of major historical transformations in their
   present constitution.

AB Across the disciplinary frontiers of the social sciences, studies by
   social scientists treating their own investigative practices as sites of
   empirical inquiry have proliferated. Most of these studies have been
   retrospective, historical, after-the-fact reconstructions of social
   scientific studies mixing interview data with the (predominantly
   textual) traces that investigations leave behind. Observational studies
   of in situ work in social science research are, however, relatively
   scarce.
   Ethnomethodology was an early and prominent attempt to treat social
   science methodology as a topic for sociological investigations and, in
   this paper, we draw out what we see as its distinctive contribution:
   namely, a focus on troubles as features of the in situ, practical
   accomplishment of method, in particular, the way that research outcomes
   are shaped by the local practices of investigators in response to the
   troubles they encounter along the way. Based on two case studies, we
   distinguish methodological troubles as problems and methodological
   troubles as phenomena to be studied, and suggest the latter orientation
   provides an alternate starting point for addressing social scientists'
   investigative practices.

AB This paper contributes to an expanding body of research that has
   analysed the interactional foundations of economic activity, and price
   determination, by quantifying the financial implications of different
   micro-interactional practices. Drawing on video recordings of
   naturalistic interaction the paper analyses a simple consumer choice,
   whether to pay one of two prices, the lower 'standard' price (8.00)
   pound or the higher 'gift aid' (8.80) pound price, to enter an arts
   institution. Utilizing resources from conversation analysis, the paper
   analyses different ways of posing this choice. It describes how, as
   interactional constraints tighten, standard prices become less socially
   desirable and customers increasingly 'volunteer' to pay the higher
   price. The paper contributes to sociological understandings of economic
   activity, demonstrating how simple one-off choices, and prices, are
   accountably responsive to micro-interactional structures.

AB Research on family history argues it performs the task of anchoring a
   sense of 'self' through tracing ancestral connection and cultural
   belonging, seeing it as a form of storied 'identity-work'. This paper
   draws on a small-scale qualitative study to think further on the
   identity-work of family history. Using practice theory, and a
   disaggregated notion of 'identity', it explores how the storying of
   family histories relates to genealogy as a leisure hobby, a form of
   historical research, and an information-processing activity; and
   examines the social organization of that narrativity, where various
   practical engagements render certain kinds of genealogical information
   more, or less, 'storyable'. Key features of 'identity-work' in family
   history, such as the construction of genealogy as a personal journey of
   discovery and identification with particular ancestors, emerge as a
   consequence of the procedures of family history, organized as a set of
   practical tasks. The paper explores 'identity-work' as a consequence of
   people's engagement in specific social practices which provide an
   internal logic to their actions, with various components of 'identity'
   emerging as categories of practice shaped within, and for, use. Focusing
   on 'identity' as something produced when we are engaged in doing other
   things, the paper examines how the practical organization of 'doing
   other things' helps produce 'identity' in particular ways.

AB Although conspiracy theories have been politically significant
   throughout history, only a few empirical studies have been about their
   influence on readers' views. Combining a rational choice approach with a
   content analysis of an anti-Semitic best-selling conspiracy theory book
   series in Turkey - the Efendi series - and semi-structured interviews
   with its readers, this paper reveals the effects of the conspiracy
   theories on readers' political perspectives. The findings suggest that
   whereas the rightists are reactive to the Jewish origins of the Donmes,
   the leftists oppose the Donmes as dominant bourgeois figures. This paper
   concludes that left- and right-wing adherents use the conspiratorial
   accounts in line with their political views and ontological
   insecurities. It expands the existing academic literature, which
   conceptualizes conspiracy theories either as paranoid delusions or as
   neutral, rational narratives, by showing that they can be both.

AB This paper explores how Ulrich Beck's world-risk-society theory (WRST)
   and Bruno Latour's Actor-Network Theory (ANT) can be combined to advance
   a theory of cosmopolitics. On the one hand, WRST helps to examine
   'cosmopolitan politics', how actors try to inject cosmopolitanism into
   existing political practices and institutions anchored in the logic of
   nationalism. On the other hand, ANT sheds light on 'cosmological
   politics', how scientists participate in the construction of reality as
   a reference point for political struggles. By combining the WRST and ANT
   perspectives, it becomes possible to achieve a more comprehensive
   understanding of cosmopolitics that takes into account both political
   and ontological dimensions. The proposed synthesis of WRST and ANT also
   calls for a renewal of critical theory by making social scientists aware
   of their performative involvement in cosmopolitics. This renewal prompts
   social scientists to explore how they can pragmatically support certain
   ideals of cosmopolitics through continuous dialogues with their objects
   of study, actors who inhabit different nations and different cosmoses.

AB Reforms which increase the stock of education in a society have long
   been held by policy-makers as key to improving rates of
   intergenerational social mobility. Yet, despite the intuitive
   plausibility of this idea, the empirical evidence in support of an
   effect of educational expansion on social fluidity is both indirect and
   weak. In this paper we use the raising of the minimum school leaving age
   from 15 to 16 years in England and Wales in 1972 to estimate the effect
   of educational participation and qualification attainment on rates of
   intergenerational social class mobility. Because, in expectation,
   children born immediately before and after the policy was implemented
   are statistically exchangeable, the difference in the amount of
   education they received may be treated as exogenously determined. The
   exogenous nature of the additional education gain means that differences
   in rates of social mobility between cohorts affected by the reform can
   be treated as having been caused by the additional education. The data
   for the analysis come from the ONS Longitudinal Study, which links
   individual records from successive decennial censuses between 1971 and
   2001. Our findings show that, although the reform resulted in an
   increase in educational attainment in the population as a whole and a
   weakening of the association between attainment and class origin, there
   was no reliably discernible increase in the rate of intergenerational
   social mobility.

   Public sector wages are crucial in achieving efficient allocation of
   jobs. High wages induce too many unemployed to queue for public sector
   jobs, in turn raising unemployment. The optimal wage depends on the
   frictions in the two sectors. Following technology shocks, public sector
   wages should be pro-cyclical and deviations from the optimal policy
   significantly increase the volatility of unemployment.

   whether and to what extent experiences impact individuals' generalized
   trust, as measured with the standard trust survey question. So far,
   reliable empirical evidence regarding the causal effect of experiences
   on generalized trust is scarce. Studies either do not directly measure
   the quality of experiences or use designs that are prone to selection
   bias. In the present study, we investigate a unique panel data set from
   Switzerland that contains measures of trust and measures of negative
   experiences, i.e. victimization. We use change score analysis and
   'genetic matching' to investigate the causal effect of victimization on
   generalized trust and find no substantially strong effect that is

AB When effort is observable to peers, students may try to avoid social
   penalties by conforming to prevailing norms. To test this hypothesis, we
   first consider a natural experiment that introduced a performance
   leaderboard into computer-based high school courses. The result was a 24
   percent performance decline. The decline appears to be driven by a
   desire to avoid the leaderboard; top performing students prior to the
   change, those most at risk of appearing on the leaderboard, had a 40
   percent performance decline, while poor performing students improved
   slightly. We next consider a field experiment that offered students
   complimentary access to an online SAT preparatory course. Sign-up forms
   differed randomly across students only in whether they said the decision
   would be kept private from classmates. In nonhonors classes, sign-up was
   11 percentage points lower when decisions were public rather than
   private. Honors class sign-up was unaffected. For students taking honors
   and nonhonors classes, the response depended on which peers they were
   with at the time of the offer, and thus to whom their decision would be
   revealed. When offered the course in a nonhonors class (where peer
   sign-up rates are low), they were 15 percentage points less likely to
   sign up if the decision was public. But when offered the course in an
   honors class (where peer sign-up rates are high), they were 8 percentage
   points more likely to sign up if the decision was public. Thus, students
   are highly responsive to their peers are the prevailing norm when they
   make decisions.

AB This study demonstrates that body mass in middle and late adulthood is a
   consequence of the complex interplay among individuals' genes, lifetime
   socioeconomic experiences, and the historical context in which they
   live. Drawing on approximately 9,000 genetic samples from the Health and
   Retirement Study, we first investigate how socioeconomic status (SES)
   over the life course moderates the impact of 32 established
   obesity-related genetic variants on body mass index (BMI) in middle and
   late adulthood. We then consider differences across birth cohorts in the
   genetic influence on BMI, and cohort variations in the moderating
   effects of life-course SES on the genetic influence. Our analyses
   suggest that persistently low SES over the life course or downward
   mobility (e.g., high SES in childhood but low SES in adulthood) amplify
   the genetic influence on BMI, and persistently high SES or upward
   mobility (e.g., low SES in childhood but high SES in adulthood)
   compensate for such influence. For more recent birth cohorts, the
   genetic influence on BMI becomes stronger, but the moderating effects of
   lifetime SES on the genetic influence are weaker compared to earlier
   cohorts. We discuss these findings in light of social changes during the
   obesity epidemic in the United States.

   on Israel, where higher education has experienced significant expansion

   horizontal ethno-religious inequality. The findings indicate that
   Ashkenazim, the privileged Jewish group, remain the most advantaged
   regarding enrollment in higher education, but their advantage over other
   veteran Jewish groups is mainly owing to areas of specialization in high
   school and achievement on the tests that serve as admission criteria to
   the higher education institutions. Among the enrollees, controlling for
   high school history reveals that the disadvantaged Jewish groups,
   Mizrachim and new immigrants, have higher odds than Ashkenazim of
   enrolling in lucrative programmes. Muslim, Druze, and Christian Arabs
   are disadvantaged regarding both the vertical (access) and horizontal
   (fields of study) dimensions, regardless of high school history and
   previous achievements.

AB This study uses comparative data from the European Social Survey to
   investigate the influence of self-transcendence and conservation values
   on public support for the welfare state. The results firstly show that
   these value dimensions are strongly related to welfare state support in
   the majority of the countries investigated. The main contribution of
   this study, however, is that it evidences striking differences between
   countries regarding which values drive welfare attitudes, and the
   strength of the association between values and attitudes. Moreover, we
   show that the between-country variation in value effects is
   systematically related to contextual factors. Self-transcendence values
   are found to be a strong predictor of welfare state support in countries
   with high levels of social expenditure. In the less generous welfare
   states of Eastern Europe, the effects of self-transcendence values are
   weaker or absent. In Eastern European countries, conservation rather
   than self-transcendence values drive attitudes to the welfare state.
   Outspoken cohort differences in value effects in Eastern European
   countries as well as persisting differences between East and West
   Germany confirm our interpretation that the particular Eastern European
   pattern can be ascribed to the unique experiences of 'authoritarian
   egalitarianism' under communism.

   growth in the use of antidepressants and at the same time economic
   instability, the aim of this study is to unravel the relations between
   employment status/job insecurity, seeking professional care for MH
   problems, and antidepressant use. Data from the Eurobarometer 345 (2010)
   are used to perform gender-differentiated, multilevel logistic
   regression analyses. Our results show that, in accordance with the need
   hypothesis, part of the professional care use for emotional problems and
   part of the antidepressant use among the unemployed and those in
   insecure jobs are associated with their comparatively worse MH status.
   In addition, medicalization processes contribute to more frequent care
   and antidepressant use, irrespective of MH status, among the unemployed:
   increased antidepressant consumption among women in insecure jobs and
   more general practitioner consultations for emotional health problems
   among their male counterparts. In conclusion, evidence is found for both
   the need hypothesis as well as the medicalization hypothesis. In
   addition, we cannot conclude that women are more vulnerable to
   medicalization than men are.

AB This article examines the impact of social origin on tertiary graduates'
   labour market outcomes in Germany and the United Kingdom, two distinct
   countries in terms of higher education systems, labour market
   structures, and their linkages. Data from the 2005 REFLEX survey, OLS
   regression and linear probability models are used to analyse the effect
   of parental education on graduates' occupational destinations at two
   time points: at labour market entry and five years after graduation. We
   test various hypotheses on country variation (i) in the strength of
   association between origin and occupational destinations, (ii) in the
   mechanisms by which social origin affects occupational destinations
   (i.e. via qualitative education differences), and (iii) in the extent to
   which social origin matters at different career stages. The results show
   that parental education effects are similar in the two countries when
   occupational destinations are analysed using the International
   Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI). They substantially
   differ when the analyses focus on entry into the higher-service class.
   In this latter case, both the gross and the net effects of parental

AB In the present contribution, we address the idea that income inequality
   can 'get under the skin' and worsen the symptoms of depression. We
   investigate whether this effect can be explained by country differences
   in the average coping resources citizens have at their disposal, as well
   as the average extent to which they engage in social comparisons. In
   addition, we examine whether coping resources can protect individuals
   from the detrimental effect of inequality and whether the effect of
   inequality varies according to socio-economic (SES) positions. We use
   multilevel techniques on a sample of 43,824 respondents collected by the
   European Social Survey (ESS) 2006/2007 in 23 European countries and find
   that individuals in countries with greater income inequalities report
   more depressive symptoms. Although social comparisons are associated
   with more depressive symptoms, they do not explain the effect of
   inequality and neither do coping resources. However, we do find that
   coping resources can protect against the stress of living in a society
   with high income inequality. Our results provide some support for the
   idea that inequality is most corrosive to the mental health of the
   people in the middle of the income hierarchy.

AB While previous studies unequivocally show that education and attitudes
   towards immigrants correlate, the underlying mechanisms remain debated.
   The liberalization effect claims that education fosters egalitarian
   values and analytic skills, which translate into positive attitudes.
   Additionally, the higher educated are less likely to face economic
   competition from immigrants. However, research on socialization shows
   that political attitudes develop early in life. Thus, there may be
   self-selection into education. While there is reason to expect both
   education and selection effects, previous work has relied exclusively on
   cross-sectional analyses, thus confounding the two mechanisms. Drawing
   on the Swiss Household Panel, we find that virtually all variation in
   education disappears when only within-individual variance is modelled.
   While we find strong differences in attitudes towards immigrants between
   individuals, we observe little change in attitudes as individuals pass
   through education. Furthermore, our findings show that when entering the
   labour market, higher educated individuals also become more likely to
   oppose immigrants. This suggests that differences between educational
   groups are mostly due to selection effects, and not to the alleged
   liberalizing effect of education. We conclude that future research on
   attitudes towards immigrants would greatly benefit from addressing
   selection into education.

AB Experimental tests of dynamically inconsistent time preferences have
   largely relied on choices over time-dated monetary rewards. Several
   recent studies have failed to find the standard patterns of present
   bias. However, such monetary studies contain often-discussed confounds.
   In this article, we sidestep these confounds and investigate choices
   over consumption (real effort) in a longitudinal experiment. We pair
   this effort study with a companion monetary discounting study. We
   confirm very limited time inconsistency in monetary choices. However,
   subjects show considerably more present bias in effort. Furthermore,
   present bias in the allocation of work has predictive power for demand
   of a meaningfully binding commitment device. Therefore our findings
   validate a key implication of models of dynamic inconsistency, with
   corresponding policy implications.

   through voter behavior and ultimately impacts the distribution of
   political spending. I test the theory on data from Sierra Leone using

AB Dual-process models of culture and action posit that fast, automatic
   cognitive processes largely drive human action, with conscious processes
   playing a much smaller role than was previously supposed. These models
   have done much to advance our understanding of behavior, but they focus
   on generic processes rather than specific cultural content. As useful as
   this has been, it tells us little about which forms of culture matter
   for action. Drawing on a cross-disciplinary set of theory and evidence,
   I argue that values are tied to many forms of behavior, across both
   contexts and cultures, and they operate in ways consistent with
   dual-process models. I illustrate the plausibility of these claims using
   data from the second wave of the European Social Survey, as well as
   real-time decision data from a large, online survey. I show that values
   predict self-reported behaviors in a variety of substantive domains and
   across 25 nations, and they operate using automatic cognitive processes.
   These findings suggest that values merit renewed theoretical and
   empirical attention.

AB A growing literature documents the importance of family instability for
   child wellbeing. In this article, we use longitudinal data from the
   Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to examine the impacts of
   family instability on children's cognitive and socioemotional
   development in early and middle childhood. We extend existing research
   in several ways: (1) by distinguishing between the number and types of
   family structure changes; (2) by accounting for time-varying as well as
   time-constant confounding; and (3) by assessing racial/ethnic and gender
   differences in family instability effects. Our results indicate that
   family instability has a causal effect on children's development, but
   the effect depends on the type of change, the outcome assessed, and the
   population examined. Generally speaking, transitions out of a two-parent
   family are more negative for children's development than transitions
   into a two-parent family. The effect of family instability is more
   pronounced for children's socioemotional development than for their
   cognitive achievement. For socioemotional development, transitions out
   of a two-parent family are more negative for white children, whereas
   transitions into a two-parent family are more negative for Hispanic
   children. These findings suggest that future research should pay more
   attention to the type of family structure transition and to population
   heterogeneity.

AB How will Hispanic population growth affect black-white relations in the
   United States? Research on intergroup relations operates within a
   two-group paradigm, furnishing few insights into multi-group contexts.
   This study is based on an original experiment that combines behavioral
   game and survey methods to evaluate the impact of perceived Hispanic
   growth on attitudes and behavior. Results reveal opposite reactions
   among blacks and whites. Whites in the baseline condition contribute
   comparable amounts to black and white recipients in a dictator game,
   whereas whites who first read about Hispanic growth contribute more to
   white recipients than to black ones. By contrast, blacks in the baseline
   condition contribute more to black recipients than to white ones,
   whereas blacks who first read about Hispanic growth contribute
   comparable amounts to black and white recipients. Patterns of
   identification mirror patterns of contributions: whites exposed to
   Hispanic growth identify relatively more strongly with their racial
   group than with their national group, whereas blacks exposed to Hispanic
   growth identify relatively more strongly with their national group than
   with their racial group. Together, these results suggest that people
   respond to the growth of a third group by prioritizing the most
   privileged identity to which they can plausibly lay claim and which also
   excludes the growing group.

AB This article documents a new macro-segregation, where the locus of
   racial differentiation resides increasingly in socio-spatial processes
   at the community or place level. The goal is to broaden the spatial lens
   for studying segregation, using decennial Census data on 222
   metropolitan areas. Unlike previous neighborhood studies of racial
   change, we decompose metropolitan segregation into its within- and
   between-place components from 1990 to 2010. This is accomplished with
   the Theil index (H). Our decomposition of H reveals large post-1990
   declines in metropolitan segregation. But, significantly,
   macro-segregationthe between-place componenthas increased since 1990,
   offsetting declines in the within-place component. The macro component
   of segregation is also most pronounced and increasing most rapidly among
   blacks, accounting for roughly one-half of all metro segregation in the
   most segregated metropolitan areas of the United States.
   Macro-segregation is least evident among Asians, which suggests other
   members of these communities (i.e., middle-class or affluent ethnoburbs)
   have less resistance to Asians relocating there. These results on
   emerging patterns of macro-segregation are confirmed in fixed-effects
   models that control for unobserved heterogeneity across metropolitan
   areas. Unlike most previous studies focused on the uneven distribution
   of racial and ethnic groups across metropolitan neighborhoods, we show
   that racial residential segregation is increasingly shaped by the cities
   and suburban communities in which neighborhoods are embedded.

AB An oft-heard concern about the sustainability of the welfare state is
   that generous social welfare provisions serve as an important pull
   factor in immigrants' consideration of their preferred country of
   destination. With their accumulated social risks, immigrants are
   averagely more likely to claim welfare benefits, suggesting that
   generous provisions reinforce migration flows, and that migrants benefit
   more from welfare than they contribute to it. Yet, little is known about
   what immigrants actually think about government support to ensure a
   reasonable standard of living. To study immigrants' ideas about the
   welfare state, we analyse the 2008 'Welfare Attitudes' module of the
   European Social Survey. Our analysis shows that, although immigrants
   have somewhat stronger pro-welfare opinions than non-immigrants, these
   are largely explained by their more disadvantaged position in society
   and their more depressed opinions of the social malaise taking place in
   their receptive society. Furthermore, much to our surprise, we find that
   immigrants' views on welfare closely follow those of the non-migrant
   population of the country they are living in, suggesting strong social
   integration at the opinion level.

   affected by migration. Propensity score matching methods are applied to
   estimate the effects of migration in children 10-15 years old from a

   positive effects on their objective well-being but no negative effects
   on their subjective well-being. There is little difference between the

AB Through an examination of LGBTQ(Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender and
   Queer) participation in the undocumented immigrant youth movement, this
   research offers a theoretical framework for understanding how social
   movements can promote the attainment of leadership roles by members of
   disadvantaged subgroups contained within a larger constituency.
   Empirical analyses utilize data from web surveys and semi-structured
   interviews collected from undocumented youth activists in California in
   2011-2012. Findings indicate that LGBTQ activists encountered
   significant challenges to disclosing their sexual orientation. Yet these
   youth comprised a significant proportion of movement participants and
   they were more civically engaged than their straight peers. I argue that
   LGBTQ prominence among undocumented youth activists can, in part, be
   attributed to identity processes within this movement. Specifically, the
   recognition and activation of multiply marginalized identities at
   various levels of collective identity formation at the broader movement,
   organizational, and individual levels catalyzed intersectional
   mobilization, meaning high levels of activism and commitment among a
   disadvantaged subgroup within an already marginalized constituency. At
   the movement level, I show how the immigrant youth movement's adoption
   of the LGBTQ rights "coming out" strategy empowered undocumented youth

   multi-identity work that addressed activists' overlapping identities
   created inclusive environments for LGBTQ members. Finally, at the

   consciousness regarding the multiple forms of oppression they
   experienced; this, in turn, intensified their activism.

AB In recent years, more than 24 Pennsylvania communities have proposed
   restrictionist immigration ordinances. These policies include fines for
   employers and landlords of undocumented immigrants, and English-only
   declarations. Using fixed effects regression, I find that the proposal
   of these policies was associated with a 6 percent increase in handgun
   sales in the Pennsylvania counties in which these ordinances were
   formally considered. I use ethnographic and newspaper data from
   Pennsylvania to uncover the mechanisms that link these laws with
   increased gun purchases. I find that as public leaders made the case for
   these policies, they increasingly linked immigrants with crime and
   social disorder. These menacing portrayals of immigrants intensified
   social anxiety, which led to an increase in gun purchases. These results
   are replicated using concealed gun permits data from South Carolina.
   This article contributes to the symbolic politics literature by showing
   the social consequences of politicians' use of threatening symbols to
   portray immigrants, as well as to the gun-ownership literature by
   providing evidence for the role of social and political factors in
   influencing gun acquisition. The proliferation of gun ownership could
   have worrisome public health consequences in communities experiencing
   rapid demographic changes.

AB Many contested issues in the American public and political spheres are
   rooted in fundamentally differing views of the scope, causes, and
   consequences of social problems. This is certainly true for two major
   interrelated social problems with racial implications: crime and labor
   market inequalities. In the era since the civil rights movement made the
   open expression of racial bias less socially acceptable, however, public
   and political discussions of social problems with racial implications
   are often framed in purportedly race-neutral ways (Bonilla-Silva 2010;
   Schuman et al. 1997). Drawing on group position (Blumer 1958) and
   collective action framing (Benford and Snow 2000) perspectives and
   employing the 2008-2009 ANES Panel Study, the present work suggests an
   enduring influence of racial bias on the ways people understand these
   major social problems. In contrast to earlier eras, however, much of the
   contemporary role of racial bias is hidden. The current work employs an
   implicit measure of racial bias that is resistant to a social
   desirability bias (Payne et al. 2005) to reveal a more complete picture
   of the influence of racial bias on the way people perceive social
   problems-even among those who explicitly deny possessing such biases.
   Specifically, this work reveals roles for both explicit and implicit
   racial bias in the way non-Hispanic whites identify the severity of
   problems, attribute blame for problems, and are motivated to concern
   around particular issues.

AB This article draws on a case study of a high-end food-service firm,
   where most workers are undocumented Mexican immigrants. This firm has
   institutionalized employment relations characterized by flexibility,
   precariousness, and contingency. I specify its unique market context,
   showing how vulnerable and precarious employees are essential to the
   firm's ability to control business uncertainties. Pulling from Alvin
   Gouldner (1954) I develop the concept of the mock calendar as a
   micro-level strategy of management that obscures the conditions of
   precarious employment at this firm. The mock calendar communicates time
   and scheduling. It is "mock" because it is illusory: it changes and
   shifts according to managers' daily manipulations. However, given the
   high-end and uncertain market niche this company operates in, managers
   are forced to provide workers with symbolic and meager material
   concessions. I conclude by suggesting that scheduling manipulation is an
   under-theorized arena of workplace control. Given recent literature that
   documents the widespread problems of wage theft, overtime violations,
   and lack of paid breaks for many service workers, understanding the
   micro processes that maintain and reproduce forms of
   twenty-first-century precarity is extremely relevant.

AB This article explores the connections between white institutional
   spaces, emotional labor, and resistance by illuminating the shared
   experiences of people of color in elite law schools and the commercial
   aviation industry. Based on in-depth qualitative data combined from two
   individual studies, we illustrate the processes by which white
   institutional spaces create a complex environment where people of color
   must navigate racial narratives, ideologies, and discourses, while
   simultaneously attempting to achieve institutional success to reap the
   material rewards of these elite institutional settings. In these
   distinct environments, people of color experience an unequal
   distribution of emotional labor as a result of negotiating both everyday
   racial micro-aggressions and dismissive dominant ideologies that deny
   the relevance of race and racism. As a result they must actively seek
   ways to engage in forms of resistance that promote counter narratives
   and protect themselves from denigration while minimizing the risk of
   severe consequence. Our data suggest that a more nuanced
   conceptualization of resistance and the context in which resistance
   occurs is needed in order to understand the everyday experiences of
   people of color.

AB While racial intermarriage is heralded as the last stage in integration
   processes, endogamy (intragroup marriage) is the overwhelming norm in
   the United States. What are the familial, dating, and community
   processes that produce endogamy? Drawing from 70 in-depth interviews
   with heterosexual Latinos concerning dating and marriage, this article
   reports that surveillance, punishment, and self-discipline harden racial
   boundaries and induce endogamy. Typically construed as highly personal,
   romantic preferences are, in fact, socially constructed and policed
   through family, peer, and community-level processes. "Third parties"
   such as family members, friend, and community members enforce
   intramarriage via advice, threats, censure, and violence. In turn,
   outsiders' surveillance and punishment converts into self-discipline,
   which constrains romantic preferences and choices. To maintain social
   distance, both non-Hispanic whites and Latinos discipline their kin and
   their kin's cross-racial romantic interests away from those who stand
   lower on the racial order. Latinos enjoy racial privilege relative to
   African Americans and preserve privilege by excluding blacks as romantic
   possibilities. Latino endogamy is a disciplined response to accumulated
   racial messages and racial boundary policing. Results show that racial
   communities are invested in perpetuating endogamy to preserve relative
   privilege and exert social pressures that largely support the
   contemporary racial hierarchy.

   probability of adding/dropping a layer is positively/negatively
   correlated with value added. Reorganization, through changes in layers,
   is essential to understanding how firms grow. Firms that expand
   substantially add layers and pay lower average wages in all preexisting

   higher average wages in all preexisting layers.

AB Standard measures of residential segregation tend to equate spatial with
   social proximity. This assumption has been increasingly subject to
   critique among demographers and ethnographers and becomes especially
   problematic in historical settings. In the late nineteenth-century
   United States, standard measures suggest a counterintuitive pattern:
   southern cities, with their long history of racial inequality, had less
   residential segregation than urban areas considered to be more racially
   tolerant. By using census enumeration procedures, we develop a sequence
   measure that captures a more subtle backyard pattern of segregation,
   where white families dominated front streets and blacks were relegated
   to alleys. Our analysis of complete household data from the 1880 Census
   documents how segregation took various forms across the postbellum
   United States. Whereas northern cities developed segregation via
   racialized neighborhoods, substituting residential inequality for the
   status inequality of slavery, southern cities embraced street-front
   segregation that reproduced the racial inequality that existed under
   slavery.

AB Many studies have examined Americans' immigration attitudes. Yet prior
   research frequently confounds multiple questions, including which
   immigrants to admit and how many to admit. To isolate attitudes on the
   former question, we use a conjoint experiment that simultaneously tests
   the influence of nine immigrant attributes in generating support for
   admission. Drawing on a two-wave, population-based survey, we
   demonstrate that Americans view educated immigrants in high-status jobs
   favorably, whereas they view those who lack plans to work, entered
   without authorization, are Iraqi, or do not speak English unfavorably.
   Strikingly, Americans' preferences vary little with their own education,
   partisanship, labor market position, ethnocentrism, or other attributes.
   Beneath partisan divisions over immigration lies a broad consensus about
   who should be admitted to the country. The results are consistent with
   norms-based and sociotropic explanations of immigration attitudes. This
   consensus points to limits in both theories emphasizing economic and
   cultural threats, and sheds new light on an ongoing policy debate.

   policy platforms by incorporating ideology and opportunism of party
   members and interests and sympathies of voters. If welfare spending is a
   normal good within income classes, a majority of voters moves rightward
   when inequality increases. As a response, the left, in particular, shift
   their welfare policy platform toward less generosity. We find support

   ratification can activate domestic mechanisms that make repression more
   costly, and the legislative opposition can enhance these mechanisms.
   Legislative veto players raise the cost of formalistic repressive
   strategies by declining to consent to legislation. Executives can still
   choose to rely on more costly, extralegal strategies, but these could
   result in severe penalties for the leader and require the leader to
   expend resources to hide. Especially in treaty member-states,
   legislatures can use other powers to also increase the cost of
   extralegal violations, which can further reduce repression. By using an
   empirical strategy that attempts to address the selection effects in
   treaty commitment decisions, I show that positive effects of human
   rights treaties increase when there are more legislative veto players.

AB The conventional wisdom that the poor are less likely to vote than the
   rich is based upon research on voting behavior in advanced
   industrialized countries. However, in some places, the relationship
   between turnout and socioeconomic status is reversed. We argue that the
   potential tax exposure of the rich explains the positive relationship
   between income and voting in some places and not others. Where the rich
   anticipate taxation, they have a greater incentive to participate in
   politics, and politicians are more likely to use fiscal policy to gain
   support. We explore two factors affecting the tax exposure of the
   richthe political salience of redistribution in party politics and the
   state's extractive capacity. Using survey data from developed and
   developing countries, we demonstrate that the rich turn out to vote at
   higher rates when the political preferences of the rich and poor diverge
   and where bureaucratic capacity is high.

   has come to play an increasingly important role in political coverage in
   the United States, but some research suggests it may be ineffective at
   reducing public misperceptions about controversial issues. However,
   fact-checking might instead help improve political discourse by
   increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation
   for political elites. To evaluate this deterrent hypothesis, we
   conducted a field experiment on a diverse group of state legislators
   from nine U.S. states in the months before the November 2012 election.
   In the experiment, a randomly assigned subset of state legislators was
   sent a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and
   electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements.
   The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less
   likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their
   accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce
   inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat.
