AB The ability of presidents to unilaterally shape administrative
   policymaking challenges a foundation of congressional power: Rarely can
   Congress statutorily veto administrative actions over presidential
   opposition. Consequently, Congress has turned to other means of
   influence, including the appropriations and oversight processes,
   although questions remain about the degree to which they have been
   effective. To investigate, I study a spatial model of administrative
   policymaking that assumes Congress can execute a legislative veto, as
   well as a baseline model in which congressional influence requires a
   coalition with the president. I compare the two models and develop
   empirical tests that exploit instances when their implications differ.
   Applying the tests to data on federal regulatory policymaking shows
   consistent evidence that Congress exerts veto power over administrative
   activity, even over those actions endorsed by the president. I conclude
   by discussing some broader implications, including the extent to which
   existing studies understate the constraints on presidential power.

AB Do minorities fare worse under direct democracy than under
   representative democracy? We provide new evidence by studying
   naturalization requests of immigrants in Switzerland that were typically
   decided with referendums in each municipality. Using panel data from
   about 1,400 municipalities for the 1991-2009 period, we exploit Federal
   Court rulings that forced municipalities to transfer the decisions to
   their elected municipality councils. We find that naturalization rates
   surged by about 60% once politicians rather than citizens began deciding
   on naturalization applications. Whereas voters in referendums face no
   cost of arbitrarily rejecting qualified applicants based on
   discriminatory preferences, politicians in the council are constrained
   to formally justify rejections and may be held accountable by judicial
   review. Consistent with this mechanism, the increase in naturalization
   rates caused by switching from direct to representative democracy is
   much stronger for more marginalized immigrant groups and in areas where
   voters are more xenophobic or where judicial review is more salient.

AB This article assesses the normative and positive claims regarding the
   consequences of biased media using a political agency framework that
   includes a strategic voter, polarized politicians, and news providers.
   My model predicts that voters are always better informed with unbiased
   than with biased outlets even when the latter have opposite ideological
   preferences. However, biased media may improve voter welfare. Contrary
   to several scholars' fears, partisan news providers are not always bad
   for democracy. My theoretical findings also have important implications
   for empirical analyses of the electoral consequences of changes in the
   media environment. The impact of left-wing and right-wing biased outlets
   depends on the partisan identity of officeholders. Empirical findings
   may, thus, not be comparable across studies or even over time within a
   study. Existing empirical works are unlikely to measure the consequences
   of biased media, as researchers never observe and can rarely approximate
   the adequate counterfactual: elections with unbiased news outlets.

AB To the degree that voters care about competence, expertise, and other
   valence characteristics of their representatives and political parties
   care about winning elections, parties have an incentive to signal that
   their legislators have such characteristics. We construct a model of
   parties, motivated by both reelection and by policy, that attempt to
   signal individual incumbents' valences to voters through the assignment
   of these members to positions of authority. The model illustrates how
   electorally motivated party leaders will have an incentive to promote
   less competent incumbents than they would if voters did not make
   inferences from promotion decisions. We derive the model's empirical
   implications and test them with original data on the careers of Chilean
   senators serving between 1998 and 2013. In support of the model's
   insights, we find that promotion to a leadership position is an
   effective signal to voters only if the promoted incumbent has extreme
   views relative to the party.

AB Many enduring questions in international relations theory focus on power
   relations, so it is important that scholars have a good measure of
   relative power. The standard measure of relative military power, the
   capability ratio, is barely better than random guessing at predicting
   militarized dispute outcomes. We use machine learning to build a
   superior proxy, the Dispute Outcome Expectations (DOE) score, from the
   same underlying data. Our measure is an order of magnitude better than
   the capability ratio at predicting dispute outcomes. We replicate Reed
   et al. (2008) and find, contrary to the original conclusions, that the
   probability of conflict is always highest when the state with the least
   benefits has a preponderance of power. In replications of 18 other
   dyadic analyses that use power as a control, we find that replacing the
   standard measure with DOE scores usually improves both in-sample and

AB Contemporary efforts to evaluate representation often compare survey
   measures of how citizens say they would vote on legislation to what
   elected officials do in office. These comparisons generally suggest poor
   representation. We argue here that this common design is unlikely to
   effectively evaluate representation because responses to survey
   questions differ in important aspects from voting in legislatures.
   Measurement error and construct validity undermine the comparison. Three
   survey experiments show that providing partisan and nonpartisan
   information readily available to legislators materially changes
   respondents' expressed preferences on roll-call votes. With information,
   expressed policy positions are both less centrist and more closely
   matched to legislator behavior in their preferred party. Respondents
   also appear aware of their own lack of knowledge in evaluating roll-call
   policy votes. The treatment effect of information decreases in
   confidence judging policy in that area. We show similar patterns for
   respondent opinions on Supreme Court decisions.

AB Central governments face compliance problems when they rely on local
   governments to implement policy. In authoritarian political systems,
   these challenges are pronounced because local governments do not face
   citizens at the polls. In a national-scale, randomized field experiment
   in China, we test whether a public, non-governmental rating of municipal
   governments' compliance with central mandates to disclose information
   about the management of pollution increased compliance. We find
   significant and positive treatment effects on compliance after only one
   year that persist with reinforcement into a second post-treatment year.
   The public rating appears to decrease the costs of monitoring compliance
   for the central government without increasing public and media attention
   to pollution, highlighting when this mode of governance is likely to
   emerge. These results reveal important roles that nonstate actors can
   play in enhancing the accountability of local governments in
   authoritarian political systems.

AB A vast literature debates the efficacy of descriptive representation in
   legislatures. Though studies argue it influences how communities are
   represented through constituency service, they are limited since
   legislators' service activities are unobserved. Using Freedom of
   Information Act (FOIA) requests, we collected 88,000 records of
   communication between members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies
   during the 108th-113th Congresses. These legislative interventions allow
   us to examine members' "follow-through" with policy implementation. We
   find that women, racial/ethnic minorities, and veterans are more likely
   to work on behalf of constituents with whom they share identities.
   Including veterans offers leverage in understanding the role of
   political cleavages and shared experiences. Our findings suggest that
   shared experiences operate as a critical mechanism for representation,
   that a lack of political consensus is not necessary for substantive
   representation, and that the causal relationships identified by
   experimental work have observable implications in the daily work of
   Congress.

AB Lobbyists frequently join forces to influence policy, yet the success of

   article is the first to test how and when characteristics of active
   coalitions increase their lobbying success. Based on pluralist theory,
   one can expect diverse coalitions, uniting different societal interests,
   to signal broad support to policy makers. Yet, their responsiveness to
   this signal (i.e., signaling benefits) and contribution incentives
   within the coalition (i.e., cooperation costs) are likely to vary with
   issue salience. This theory is tested on a unique data set comprising 50
   issues in five European countries. Results reveal a strong moderating
   effect of salience on the relationship between coalition diversity and
   success: On less salient issues, homogenous coalitions are more likely
   to succeed, whereas the effect reverses with higher salience, where
   diverse coalitions are more successful. These findings have implications
   for understanding political responsiveness and potential policy capture.

AB When forming beliefs about themselves, politics, and how the world works
   more generally, people often face a tension between conclusions they
   inherently wish to reach and those which are plausible. And the
   likelihood of beliefs about one variable (e.g., the performance of a

   (e.g., the quality and bias of newspapers reporting on the politician).
   I propose a formal approach to combine these two forces, creating a
   tractable way to study the distortion of related beliefs. The approach
   unifies several central ideas from psychology (e.g., motivated
   reasoning, attribution) that have been applied heavily to political
   science. Concrete applications shed light on why successful individuals
   sometimes attribute their performance to luck ("imposter syndrome"), why
   those from advantaged groups believe they in fact face high levels of
   discrimination (the "persecution complex"), and why partisans disagree
   about the accuracy and bias of news sources.

AB Pinning down the role of social ties in the decision to protest has been

   an attendant measure of real-world behavior. We collect data on Twitter
   activity during the 2015 Charlie Hebdo protest in Paris, which,
   unusually, record real-world protest attendance and network structure
   measured beyond egocentric networks. We devise a test of social theories
   of protest that hold that participation depends on exposure to others'
   intentions and network position determines exposure. Our findings are
   strongly consistent with these theories, showing that protesters are
   significantly more connected to one another via direct, indirect,
   triadic, and reciprocated ties than comparable nonprotesters. These
   results offer the first large-scale empirical support for the claim that

   rationale for ex post deference to biased trial judges that does not
   require an ex ante commitment by an appellate court to a standard of
   review. Second, it shows how procedural discretion can bring biased
   trial judges' rulings closer to appellate doctrine despite enabling
   trial judges to "get their way" more often. Third, de facto law as

   annuity markets are incomplete. We solve for Pareto optimal policy
   reforms and show that progressive asset subsidies provide a powerful
   tool for Pareto optimal reforms. On the other hand, earnings tax reforms
   do not always yield efficiency gains. We implement our Pareto optimal
   policy reform in an economy that features demographic change. The reform
   reduces the present discounted value of net resources consumed by each

   to inference based on the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), whereby
   measuring concepts at different unit aggregations alters the observed
   value. We offer tangible options for researchers to improve their
   research design and data analysis to limit the MAUP. To help manage the
   measurement error when the unit of observation is unclear or appropriate
   data are not available, we introduce a new measure of geographic
   distribution that accounts for fluctuations in the scale and number of
   political units considered. We demonstrate using Monte Carlo simulations
   that our measure is more reliable and stable across political units than
   commonly used indicators because it reduces measurement fluctuations
   associated with the MAUP.

AB Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (2001) (PSS) proposed a bounds procedure for
   testing for the existence of long run cointegrating relationships
   between a unit root dependent variable (
   ) and a set of weakly exogenous regressors
   when the analyst does not know whether the independent variables are
   stationary, unit root, or mutually cointegrated processes. This
   procedure recognizes the analyst's uncertainty over the nature of the
   regressors but not the dependent variable. When the analyst is uncertain
   whether
   is a stationary or unit root process, the test statistics proposed by
   PSS are uninformative for inference on the existence of a long run
   relationship (LRR) between
   and
   . We propose the long run multiplier (LRM) test statistic as a means of
   testing for LRRs without knowing whether the series are stationary or
   unit roots. Using stochastic simulations, we demonstrate the behavior of
   the test statistic given uncertainty about the univariate dynamics of
   both
   and
   , illustrate the bounds of the test statistic, and generate small sample
   and approximate asymptotic critical values for the upper and lower
   bounds for a range of sample sizes and model specifications. We
   demonstrate the utility of the bounds framework for testing for LRRs in
   models of public policy mood and presidential success.

AB According to spatial models of political competition, parties
   strategically adjust their ideological positions to movements made by
   rival parties. Spatial econometric techniques have been proposed to
   empirically model such interdependencies and to closely convert
   theoretical expectations into statistical models. Yet, these models
   often ignore that the parties' ideological positions are latent
   variables and, as such, accompanied by a quantifiable amount of
   uncertainty. As a result, the implausible assumption of perfectly
   measured covariates impedes a proper evaluation of theoretical
   propositions. In order to bridge this gap between theory and empirics,
   the present work combines a spatial econometric model and a Bayesian
   dynamic item response model. The proposed model accurately accounts for
   measurement uncertainty and simultaneously estimates the parties'
   ideological positions and their spatial interdependencies. To verify the
   model's utility, I apply it to recorded votes from the sixteen German
   state legislatures in the period from 1988 to 2016. While exhibiting a
   notable degree of ideological mobility, the results indicate only
   moderate spatial dependencies among parties of the same party family.
   More importantly, the analysis illustrates how measurement uncertainty
   can lead to substantively different results which stresses the
   importance of appropriately incorporating theoretical expectations into
   statistical models.

AB This paper introduces an instrumental variables framework for analyzing
   how external factors that affect survey response rates can also affect
   the composition of the sample of respondents. The method may be useful
   for studying survey representativeness, and for assessing the
   effectiveness of some of the conventional corrections for survey
   nonresponse bias.The paper applies the method to data collected in the
   2011 Swiss Electoral Study (SES), in which survey participation
   incentives were randomly assigned across members of the original survey
   sample. The empirical analysis shows that the incentives increased
   response rates substantially. Estimates of a new instrumental variable
   parameter called the Complier Average Survey Response (CASR) suggest
   that the incentives induced participation among people with more
   nationalist political opinions than those who would have participated
   without the incentives. Weighting the respondent data to match the
   covariate distribution in the target population did not account for the
   discrepancy in attitudes between the two groups, suggesting that the
   weights would not succeed in removing nonresponse bias.

AB Political scientists are increasingly interested in causal mediation,
   and to this end, recent studies focus on estimating a quantity called
   the controlled direct effect (CDE). The CDE measures the strength of the
   causal relationship between a treatment and outcome when a mediator is
   fixed at a given value. To estimate the CDE, Joffe and Greene (2009) and
   Vansteelandt (2009) developed the method of sequential g-estimation,
   which was introduced to political science by Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen
   (2016). In this letter, we propose an alternative method called
   regression-with-residuals (RWR) for estimating the CDE. In special
   cases, we show that these two methods are algebraically equivalent. Yet,
   unlike sequential g-estimation, RWR can easily accommodate several types
   of effect moderation, including cases in which the effect of the
   mediator on the outcome is moderated by a posttreatment confounder.
   Although common in the social sciences, this type of effect moderation
   is typically assumed away in applications of sequential g-estimation,
   which may lead to bias if effect moderation is in fact present. We
   illustrate RWR by estimating the CDE of negative media framing on public
   support for immigration, controlling for respondent anxiety.

   Analyzing the same data from the original study, this comment employs
   additional techniques and compares the quality of the predicted

   approaches do, in fact, outperform the nonexperts in important ways.
   Based on these new analyses, it is difficult to accept the conclusion

AB Social scientists are frequently interested in how populations evolve
   over time. Creating poststratification weights for surveys, for example,
   requires information on the weighting variables' joint distribution in
   the target population. Typically, however, population data are sparsely
   available across time periods. Even when population data are observed,
   the content and structure of the data-which variables are observed and
   whether their marginal or joint distributions are known-differ across
   time, in ways that preclude straightforward interpolation. As a
   consequence, survey weights are often based only on the small subset of
   auxiliary variables whose joint population distribution is observed
   regularly over time, and thus fail to take full advantage of auxiliary
   information. To address this problem, we develop a dynamic Bayesian
   ecological inference model for estimating multivariate categorical
   distributions from sparse, irregular, and noisy data on their marginal
   (or partially joint) distributions. Our approach combines (1) a
   Dirichlet sampling model for the observed margins conditional on the
   unobserved cell proportions; (2) a set of equations encoding the logical
   relationships among different population quantities; and (3) a Dirichlet
   transition model for the period-specific proportions that pools
   information across time periods. We illustrate this method by estimating
   annual U.S. phone-ownership rates by race and region based on population
   data irregularly available between 1930 and 1960. This approach may be
   useful in a wide variety of contexts where scholars wish to make dynamic
   ecological inferences about interior cells from marginal data. A new R
   package estsubpop implements the method.

AB Secularization, according to Max Weber's classic theory, shatters social
   cohesion. But if this is so, what are the prospects for democratic
   solidarity in a secular age? In this article, I examine the response
   given by one of democracy's leading intellectual architects, Jurgen
   Habermas. Whereas Weber thought that rational modernity enfeebles
   solidarity, Habermas believes that rational discourse itself inherits
   religion's moral-aesthetic power, a process that he calls the
   "linguistification of the sacred." Habermas's stress on language, I
   argue, is partly justified. Yet as I show by tracing linguistification's
   roots to emile Durkheim's sociology of religion and Walter Benjamin's
   theory of language, Habermas's program for solidarity falls short in one
   crucial respect. While shared discourse cultivates a basic interpersonal
   tolerance, it lacks the power to transport us beyond our narrow
   interests. Nonrational and prelinguistic aspects of our psychology
   remain decisive. Consequently, democratic solidarity in a secular age
   remains an unfinished project.

AB Between 1915 and 1970, millions of black and white southerners migrated
   north in search of better lives for themselves and their children. Using
   novel, longitudinally linked 1940 and 2000 census data, we investigate
   whether this mass migration corresponded to improved neighborhood
   attainment outcomes for the black and white children of Great Migration
   migrants in their adulthood. We find that black and white
   second-generation migrants tend to live in more socioeconomically
   advantaged and whiter neighborhoods than southern stayers, although
   these advantages are partially explained by the characteristics of
   second-generation migrants and their parents. Moreover, black
   second-generation migrants in the North are more successful at
   converting higher socioeconomic status into improved neighborhood
   outcomes relative to those who stayed in the South. Our findings provide
   powerful evidence that leaving the South resulted in residential
   advantages for the children of Great Migration participants.

   uncover the central incompatibilities between married women's employment
   and childrearing. Individuals' narratives reveal how labor market

AB The authors propose and test the concept of categorical manipulation, a
   process in which subordinate group demands for greater access to
   high-status categories are met with reversals in the hierarchy of
   existing categories. The analysis addresses a school district's response
   to pressure from a racial desegregation movement to improve black access
   to a high-status majority-white disability category. The district
   complied, but it also allowed whites to migrate to a low-status
   majority-black category, from which blacks then were excluded. This
   category was enhanced with benefits desirable to whites. The original
   categorical hierarchy was restored during resegregation 20 years later.
   In categorical manipulation, subordinate groups gain greater access to
   high-status categories, but these categories suffer in value as dominant
   groups reaffiliate with previously low-status categories, which may be
   revised for improvements. This is different from more familiar forms of
   resistance to change such as symbolic compliance, ritualization, and
   tokenism.

AB Civilian confidence in domestic institutions, particularly in the
   security sector, is important for stability and state consolidation in
   post-conflict countries, where third-party peacekeepers have helped
   maintain peace and security after a conflict. While other scholars have
   suggested that a strong security sector is necessary for mitigating the
   credible commitment problem, this article provides two alternative
   criteria for assessing security sector reforms' effect on confidence in
   the security sector: restraint and inclusiveness. Female ratio balancing
   in the security sector meets these two criteria, suggesting that it has
   the potential to help enhance confidence in the security sector and
   thereby create the right conditions for the peacekeeping transition. The
   argument is tested using original surveys conducted in post-conflict,
   ex-combatant communities in Liberia. The expectations received empirical
   support. The findings indicate that restraining and inclusive reforms
   could improve trust in the state's security sector. They also
   demonstrate the importance of considering gender in theories related to
   post-conflict peace building and international relations more broadly.

AB This Research Note explores the political dynamics of bureaucratic
   turnover. It argues that changes in a government's policy objectives can
   shift both political screening strategies and bureaucratic selection
   strategies, which produces turnover of agency personnel. To buttress
   this conjecture, it analyzes a unique dataset tracing the careers of all
   agency heads in the Swedish executive bureaucracy between 1960 and 2014.
   It shows that, despite serving on fixed terms and with constitutionally
   protected decision-making powers, Swedish agency heads are considerably
   more likely to leave their posts following partisan shifts in
   government. The note concludes that, even in institutional systems
   seemingly designed to insulate bureaucratic expertise from political
   control, partisan politics can shape the composition of agency
   personnel.

AB In recent years scholars have observed a restrictive turn in West
   European immigrant integration policies towards conditioning access to
   permanent residence and citizenship on language proficiency, knowledge
   of history, institutions, culture and political values, national loyalty
   and labour market integration. This has been accompanied by a strong
   reaction among European politicians and publics emphasizing that
   newcomers must share in certain liberal-democratic values and virtues
   that characterize the national community. Yet, the influential scholar
   Christian Joppke argues, among others, that liberal values cannot define
   national particularity, nor can cultural integration be enforced because
   legislation and policies are legally and normatively constrained by the
   same liberal values. Hence, prevalent liberal conceptions of national
   identity are paradoxical and inconsequential for the formulation of
   public policies. This article critically examines this argument in
   detail. It argues that the paradox of universalism does not exist, and
   that therefore nationalism should not be dismissed as a central factor
   behind recent policy developments.

AB Scholars have identified many ways that politicians use carrots, such as
   vote buying, to mobilize voters, but have paid far less attention to how
   they use sticks, such as voter intimidation. This article develops a
   simple argument which suggests that voter intimidation should be
   especially likely where vote buying is expensive and employers have
   greater leverage over employees. Using survey experiments and
   crowd-sourced electoral violation reports from the 2011-12 election
   cycle in Russia, the study finds evidence consistent with these claims.
   Moreover, it finds that where employers have less leverage over
   employees, active forms of monitoring may supplement intimidation in
   order to encourage compliance. These results suggest that employers can
   be reliable vote brokers; that voter intimidation can persist in a
   middle-income country; and that, under some conditions, intimidation may
   be employed without the need for active monitoring.

AB Autocrats rely on co-optation to limit opposition mobilization and
   remain in power. Yet not all opposition parties that pose a threat to
   their regime are successfully co-opted. This article provides a formal
   model to show that reliance on activists influences whether an
   opposition leader receives and accepts co-optation offers from an
   autocrat. Activists strengthen a party's mobilization efforts, yet
   become disaffected when their leader acquiesces to the regime. This
   dynamic undermines the co-optation of parties with a strong activist
   base, particularly those with unitary leadership. Activists have less
   influence over elite negotiations in parties with divided leadership,
   which can promote collusion with the regime. The results ultimately
   suggest that party activism can erode authoritarian control, but may
   encourage wasteful conflicts with the government.

AB Who are Africa's swing voters? This article argues that in settings
   where ethnicity is politically salient, core and swing are defined by
   whether ethnic groups have a co-ethnic leader in the election. For
   members of ethnic groups with a co-ethnic in the race, there is
   typically less uncertainty about which party or candidate will best
   represent the group's interests. For members of groups without a
   co-ethnic in the race, uncertainty is often greater, making these voters
   potentially more receptive to campaign persuasion and more likely to
   change voting intentions during the campaign. Consistent with these
   expectations, panel data from Kenya's 2013 presidential election shows
   that voters from groups without a co-ethnic in the race were more than
   two and a half times more likely to change their voting intentions
   during the campaign period.

AB This article explores an agency model in which voters learn about both
   an incumbent and an opponent. They observe the incumbent's policy record
   and update their beliefs about his opponent via a campaign. Although the
   former is relatively more informative, it can be costly for the voter to
   learn about the incumbent from her policy record. This is because policy
   reforms, which allow a voter to learn an incumbent's ability, are risky
   and can leave the voter worse off. Then the voter may prefer the
   incumbent to take safer actions. The efficient level of reform - the one
   preferred by the voter - balances the value of learning with the
   expected policy costs/benefits. In a world where the opponent's campaign
   is uninformative, reform can be too low due to the incumbent's fear of
   failure. Or it can be too high: the incumbent may gamble on success.
   This article shows that the presence of an opponent who can reveal
   information via a campaign exacerbates these inefficiencies. An
   incumbent who anticipates the effect of an opponent's campaign on voter
   beliefs is more likely to make inefficient policy choices. Further, such
   campaigns can lead to an overall welfare loss when they reveal little
   about the opponent's ability and yet have an impact on the incumbent's
   policy choice.

AB The application of spatial voting theories to popular elections
   presupposes an electorate that chooses political representatives on the
   basis of their well-structured policy preferences. Behavioral
   researchers have long contended that parts of the electorate instead
   hold unstructured and inconsistent policy beliefs. This article proposes
   an extension to spatial voting theories to analyze the effect of varying
   consistency in policy preferences on electoral behavior. The model
   results in the expectation that voters with less consistent policy
   preferences will put less weight on policy distance when learning about
   candidates who should represent their political positions. The study
   tests this expectation for the 2008 US presidential election, and finds
   that for respondents with less consistent self-placements on the
   liberal-conservative scale, policy distance less strongly affects their
   voting decision. The results have implications for the quality of
   political representation, as certain parts of the electorate are
   expected to be less closely represented.

AB This article explores (1) whether policy makers are equally responsive
   to the preferences of women and men and (2) whether the increased
   presence of women in parliament improves responsiveness to women's
   preferences. Using a time-series cross-sectional analysis of 351 party
   shifts by sixty-eight different parties across twelve Western European
   countries, the study finds that parties respond to the preference shifts
   of women and men. However, parties are more responsive to the preference
   shifts among men than among women - a finding that is not affected by
   the share of female politicians in parliament. The findings question the
   implicit assumption that substantive political representation of women
   necessarily follows from their descriptive representation in
   legislatures.

AB According to spatial models of elections, citizen perceptions of party
   policy positions are a key determinant of voting choices. Yet recent
   scholarship from Europe suggests that voters do not adjust their
   perceptions according to what parties advocate in their campaigns. This
   article argues that voters develop a more accurate understanding of
   parties' ideological positions following a leadership change because a
   new leader increases the credibility of party policy offerings. Focusing
   on Western European parties in the 1979-2012 period, it shows that
   having a new leader is a necessary condition for voters to more
   accurately perceive the left-right placements of opposition parties.
   Voters do not use party platforms to form perceptions of incumbent
   parties' positions, regardless of whether the leader is new or veteran.
   These results have important implications for models of party
   competition and democratic representation.

AB Labor unions play a prominent role in the economy and in politics, and
   have long been depicted by opponents as an overly powerful, corrupt and
   economically harmful institution. In labor-related news in recent years,
   anti-union rhetoric has regularly focused on union workers themselves,
   frequently portraying them as overpaid, greedy and undeserving of their
   wealth, while also drawing a contrast between the compensation of union
   vs. non-union workers. This type of rhetoric is referred to here as
   class-based anti-union rhetoric (CAR). Despite its prevalence, it
   remains unknown whether CAR affects public opinion toward unions. This
   study uses a series of national survey experiments to demonstrate that
   exposure to CAR reduces the perceived similarity of targeted union
   workers, unions' perceived deservingness of public support and support
   for pro-union legislation. Moreover, CAR repeatedly nullified or
   reversed the otherwise positive relationship between the strength of
   worker identity and solidarity with union workers.

   longitudinal design and more valid measures to resolve causality issues,
   the results of the empirical models show that increases in policy

   especially among individuals who hold egalitarian values. Individuals
   who are discriminated against express particularly high political

   article examines the conditions under which a climate club might emerge

   than a handful of major actors as initial members, a club can eventually
   reduce global emissions effectively. To succeed, a club must be
   initiated by the 'right' constellation of enthusiastic actors, offer
   sufficiently large incentives for reluctant countries and be reasonably
   unconstrained by conflicts between members over issues beyond climate
   change. A climate club is particularly likely to persist and grow if
   initiated by the United States and the European Union. The combination
   of club-good benefits and conditional commitments can produce broad

   events from eleven eurozone countries between 2001 and 2011. The study

   Based on the literature on motivated political reasoning and the theory
   about affective tipping points, this article hypothesizes that
   politicians tend to reject evidence that contradicts their prior
   attitudes, but that increasing the amount of evidence will reduce the
   impact of prior attitudes and strengthen their ability to interpret the
   information correctly. These hypotheses are examined using randomized
   survey experiments with responses from 954 Danish politicians, and
   results from this sample are compared to responses from similar survey
   experiments with Danish citizens. The experimental findings strongly
   support the hypothesis that politicians are biased by prior attitudes
   when interpreting information. However, in contrast to expectations, the
   findings show that the impact of prior attitudes increases when more
   evidence is provided.

AB Some parties are more popular among men, while other parties attract

   partially explained by two recurring gender differences in the
   socio-psychological literature. It argues that men's generally lower
   sensitivity to social cues makes them more likely to vote for
   stigmatized and small parties, whereas women's greater concern with
   social harmony is expected to make them less likely to vote for extreme
   parties. The models are tested at the individual and party levels using
   three waves of Comparative Study of Electoral Systems data from
   twenty-eight countries. Ceteris paribus, men are more likely than women
   to vote for parties that are socially stigmatized or ideologically
   extreme. This has consequences for the current understanding of gender
   gaps in voting, and reiterates that voting has important social aspects.

AB Previous public opinion studies argued that in the Arab Middle East and
   North Africa (MENA) Muslim citizens support gender equality less than
   non-Muslims, due to Islamic-patriarchal socialization. Deviating from
   this Orientalist narrative, we formulate a context-dependent
   agentic-socialization framework, which acknowledges religiosity's and
   gender equality's multidimensionality along with the MENA's
   political-institutional diversity. We expect that religious service
   attendance and devotion decrease support for gender equality in politics
   but not in education. Moreover, we theorize that open political
   structures allow citizens to express agency and dissociate from dominant
   patriarchal patterns. We test these expectations using WVS and AB data
   covering 50,000 respondents in 39 MENA country-years. Our results show
   religious service attendance indeed reduces support for gender equality.
   However, more devoted citizens support gender equality in education more
   than the less devoted, and in more democratic polities and in polities
   with more freedom of press, the same is found for political gender
   equality. Moreover, support for gender equality is greater in open
   polities than closed ones, but this gap closes when people frequent
   religious services. These results suggest MENA citizens are not
   univocally passively socialized by patriarchal religious views, but
   actively engage with other interpretations, provided these are not
   banned by oppressive governments.

   manager. We formulate opposing hypotheses arguing that women are either
   change agents who reduce gender inequality in earnings in their
   organization, or cogs in the machine who do not influence or even
   enlarge gender inequality in earnings. We employ unique manager-employee
   linked data from nine countries to test these hypotheses. Results are in
   line with the weak version of the women as cogs in the machine
   hypothesis: women's and men's earnings are not affected by the share of
   female managers in their organization, nor by being supervised by a
   female manager. Gender equality in earnings is thus not stimulated by
   female managerial representation. Between-country variations in results
   are discussed.

AB According to a popular argument in economics, the gender wage gap
   persists not because of employer discrimination against women, but
   because of the differential investment of fathers and mothers into paid
   work and the household. We test this argument by comparing the evolution
   of wages between men and women before the onset of family formation and
   gendered household specialization. We use a cohort study of young adults
   for Switzerland (TREE 2000-2014) and match the two sexes on their
   intellectual ability and educational attainment before they enter the
   labour market. We then use the ensuing survey waves to account for human
   capital and job characteristics as well as for values towards work and
   family. We replicate our analysis with a second panel study of Swiss
   graduate students. We find in both cohort studies an unexplained gender
   wage gap of between 3 to 6 percent in favour of men. This result
   suggests that young women earn lower wages than young men with the same
   productive characteristics long before they have children. Translated
   into annual wages, this means that young women lose out on half a
   monthly wage each year in comparison to young men.

   measures included education, income, and wealth. A 40- item Frailty

AB Christian religiosity is linked to traditional marriage attitudes. This
   article jointly studies individual, contextual and cross-level effects
   of Christian religiosity on marriage attitudes. In doing so, this
   article sheds light on the issue of how a key institution like religion
   influences societal values. Is it only via compositional effects, with
   larger numbers of religious people leading to more positive marriage
   attitudes in a society? Or does religion also have 'emergent properties'
   that have an additional effect on marriage attitudes on top of the
   compositional effect? Finally, we examine whether the strength of the
   link between individual religiousness and marriage attitudes depends on
   the religious context. We use data from the ESS 2006 and use the
   regional level as our preferred contextual level. Our results show that
   Christian religiosity has individual, contextual and cross-level
   effects. It is level of religiosity rather than type of denomination
   that matters. In more religious regions, both the religious and the
   non-religious hold more traditional marriage attitudes. Finally,
   although the more religious hold more positive marriage attitudes in
   both low and high religious contexts, the difference between both groups
   is much smaller in low than in high religious contexts. This suggests
   that an adaptation mechanism among religious people in secularized
   contexts is at work.

AB Euroscepticism is increasingly important to the shaping and
   understanding of contemporary European public opinion and politics. The
   origins of the trait, however, particularly the values that predispose
   individuals to view the European Union (EU) as a legitimate (or
   otherwise) political institution, remain poorly understood. Literature
   on political socialization identifies the family as a vital influence on
   the development of many social and political attitudes. This study
   explores the role of the family in the development of Euroscepticism by
   examining evidence of intergenerational transmission of hostility
   towards membership of the EU between parents and children in the United
   Kingdom during its `Brexit referendum'. The study shows that the
   attitudes of parents during one's politically formative years can be an
   important factor in shaping support for EU membership. It also finds
   that this intergenerational transmission is different for mothers and
   fathers: while there is a greater likelihood of a child's attitudes
   being affected by those of their father, if they are affected by their
   mother's views they are more likely to eventually share their mother's
   position on EU membership. This identifies the family as a key source of
   the values that shape support for European integration, potentially
   accelerating or opposing other social trends that have resulted in
   successive generations typically being more supportive of EU membership.

AB This study examines the effect of parents' unemployment on their
   children's subsequent educational attainment. Its theoretical
   significance lies on its focus to test the mediating role of parents'
   changing work ethics during spells of unemployment. Integrating multiple
   survey and administrative data sources, our estimates are based on a
   sample of Dutch children (n = 812) who were exposed to their parents'
   unemployment during the previous economic crisis in the early 1980s. Our
   results reveal a direct negative effect between fathers' unemployment
   duration and their children's educational attainment and also an
   indirect effect through mothers' changing attitudes towards work. We
   also find empirical evidence that mothers' and fathers' whose views
   about work become more pessimistic lead to reduced educational
   attainment among their children.

AB This study proposes subjective social status-a person's perception of
   his/her standing in the social hierarchy-is an important psychological
   mechanism driving the inequality-satisfaction link. Building on
   sociological and social-psychological research, it argues (i) the
   contextual effect of income inequality on subjective well-being is
   mediated by social status perceptions, and (ii) income inequality
   moderates the relationship between subjective social status and
   well-being. The empirical analysis is based on data from the 2012/2013
   European Social Survey. Applying multi-level modelling techniques, the
   study finds income inequality lowers the self-perception of social
   status and, in turn, the overall wellbeing of individuals (the mediation
   argument). It also finds that income inequality increases the importance
   of subjective social status to life satisfaction (the moderation
   argument). The results are limited to the European context and should
   encourage researchers to test the hypotheses in other geographic regions
   and to dig deeper into the underlying mechanisms explaining if and why
   income inequality matters to the well-being of individuals.

AB We compare household income panel data from China, Germany, the United
   Kingdom, and the United States. Consistent with previous research, we
   show that income is more unequally distributed in China than in the
   three Western countries. But China also has a higher level of
   intra-generational income mobility. Because mobility tends to have an
   income-equalizing effect, the snapshot measures of inequality overstate
   the true level of inequality in China to a greater degree than they do
   for the other countries. But even after we have taken into account the
   impact of mobility, permanent income is still more unequally distributed
   in China than in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.
   Moreover, in the three Western countries, the lion's share of income
   inequality is between individuals rather than within individual. The
   opposite holds for China. We also show that the most important
   determinants of income inequality in China are those long-standing
   institutions that predate the market reform.

AB In this paper, we develop an institutional movement logics approach to
   analyze the structure and dynamics of the US social movement field from
   1960 to 1995. Using protest event data taken from the Dynamics of
   Collective Action dataset, we elicit the most salient combinations of
   issues, tactics, and targets reported to co-occur at protest events in
   four periods: 1960-1965, 1966-1972, 1973-1987, and 1988-1995. The
   analysis reveals the existence of six movement logics of varying
   breadth, flexibility, and stability. We also detect two important shifts
   in the overall structure of the field, one toward a broad and flexible
   form of state-centric politics and one toward several differentiated and
   narrowly defined forms of nonpolitical contention. We find support for
   two key premises of the institutional movement logics framework, limited
   diversity, and relative stability within and between logics while
   showing that a longer time frame offers a window on field dynamics not
   visible with shorter study time frames. We close by providing
   suggestions for further research seeking to build on the institutional
   movement logics approach.

AB The effects of increasing levels of immigration on neighborhood change
   have long been examined, but questions remain about the effects of
   immigration on the neighborhood socioeconomic attainments of native-born
   families. This study draws from prior work to anticipate a residential
   queuing process that is triggered by immigration. Residential queuing is
   a social process that is driven by families striving to improve their
   residential circumstances in a stratified and uncertain urban landscape
   affected by increasing immigration. Empirically, residential queuing is
   evaluated over the course of two familial generations as native families
   respond to changing levels of exposure to foreign-born populations at
   the census-tract and metropolitan-area level. The results provide
   support for a historically established residential queuing process based
   on native avoidance of neighborhoods with increasing concentrations of
   foreign-born residents in conjunction with greater levels of upward
   residential mobility in metropolitan areas with increasing shares of
   foreign-born population. Alternative expectations from within the
   general queuing perspective are also evaluated: The sidestep perspective
   anticipates native-born families from poor, especially poor black,
   neighborhoods to be negatively affected by increasing metropolitan
   levels of foreign-born population, and the neighborhood revitalization
   perspective anticipates native-born families from poor neighborhoods to
   benefit from an increased neighborhood-level presence of immigration.
   The implications of these findings for immigration effects research and
   residential stratification are discussed.

AB This study explores the transmission of educational inequality across
   three generations in the United States. It addresses two common problems
   in analyses of multigenerational inequality: omitted mechanisms of
   indirect transmissions through grandparents' early influences on
   parents, and theoretically problematic tests of direct effects based on
   non-zero residual grandparent-child associations. The first problem
   leads to upwardly biased direct effect estimates; analyses that control
   for parents' attributes and experiences during their own childhood
   eliminate most grandparent-child educational associations. Conversely,
   the second problem can obscure direct effects. This study avoids
   inferring direct effects from residual grandparent-child associations by
   assessing the explanatory power of measured child attributes that
   constitute likely mechanisms of direct effects. It finds little evidence
   of direct effects overall, although there is some indication of direct
   effects on bachelor's degree attainment among those with the
   most-educated grandparents. The findings also speak to potential
   mechanisms of direct and indirect educational transmission.

AB Sex segregation across jobs is widespread. While numerous studies have
   investigated how hiring contributes to this phenomenon, scholars
   disagree on how the gender composition of the set of candidates that
   firms consider (labor queues) is related to gender disparities in
   hiring. Theories of gendered organizations posit that organizations will
   tend to disadvantage females across all jobs, including jobs where
   females predominate. Other theories suggest that female disadvantage is
   more localized, and in particular that it is contingent on the
   sex-typing of the job. Tokenism theories posit that disparities are more
   acute when individuals are in the position of tokens among those being
   evaluated. Unique among papers in this area, we examine the relationship
   between the gender composition of labor queues and the degree of gender
   disparities in hiring using a sample of 441 firms in the high-tech
   sector. Importantly, our setting allows us to distinguish between the
   predictions of theories of sex-typing and the influence of the numeric
   representation of women and men among those being evaluated (tokenism
   theories). Our main findings strongly support Kanter's token theory:
   screeners disadvantage both males and females when screening for
   positions in which candidates of the opposite gender predominate.

AB Why do some people succeed in the labor market after incarceration but
   others do not? We study the transition from prison to work with data on
   monthly employment and earnings for a sample of men and women observed
   for a year after incarceration. More than in earlier research, the data
   provide detailed measurement of temporary and informal employment and
   richly describe the labor market disadvantages of formerly incarcerated
   men and women. We find that half the sample is jobless in any given
   month and average earnings are well below the poverty level. By jointly
   modeling employment and earnings, we show that blacks and Hispanics have
   lower total earnings than whites even after accounting for health, human
   capital, social background, crime and criminal justice involvement, and
   job readiness. A decomposition attributes most of the earnings gaps to
   racial and ethnic inequalities in employment. Qualitative interviews
   suggest that whites more than blacks and Hispanics find stable,
   high-paying jobs through social networks. These findings support a
   hypothesis of racialized re-entry that helps explain the unusual
   disadvantage of African Americans at the nexus of the penal system and
   the labor market.

   Peru. We find that the size of the indigenous population varies
   dramatically depending on the measure of indigeneity used, and that
   using multiple measures captures distinct modes of indigeneity. Using
   latent class analysis, we find that contemporary indigenous
   classification clusters around four types, which we characterize as
   Traditional Indians, Indigenous Mestizos, New Indians, and
   Non-Indigenous. Traditional Indians tend to be indigenous on virtually
   all indicators, and they are especially poor, dark, and rural.
   Indigenous Mestizos tend to speak an indigenous language, but
   self-identification as indigenous is tenuous. New Indians assert an
   indigenous identity despite their frequent lack of linguistic knowledge
   and close indigenous ancestry, and they are as urban, educated, and
   light-skinned as the Non-Indigenous. The analysis addresses sociological
   concepts of ethnic boundaries, assimilation, mestizaje, and symbolic

AB Using nineteen panels of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
   (NLSY-79), we construct life-lines characterizing women's childless
   expectations and fertility behavior. One-quarter of women in the NLSY-79
   cohort ever reported an expectation for childlessness but only 14.8
   percent of women remain childless. Childless women follow two
   predominant life course paths: (1) repeated postponement of childbearing
   and the subsequent adoption of a childless expectation at older ages or
   (2) indecision about parenthood signaled through vacillating reports of
   child-less expectations across various ages. We also find that more than
   one in ten women became a mother after considering childlessness: an
   understudied group in research on childlessness and childbearing
   preferences. These findings reaffirm that it is problematic to assign
   expected and unexpected childlessness labels to the reproductive
   experience of childless women. In addition, despite their variability
   over time, childless expectations strongly predict permanent
   childlessness, regardless of the age when respondents offer them.
   Longitudinal logistic regression analysis of these childless
   expectations indicates a strong effect of childbearing postponement
   among the increasingly selective group of childless women. However, net
   of this postponement, few variables commonly associated with
   childlessness are associated with reports of a childless expectation. We
   thus conclude that the effects of socio-demographic and situational
   factors on childless expectations are channeled predominantly through
   repeated childbearing postponement.

AB When siblings have different characteristics-such as different
   achievement or different gender-how should parents invest in their
   education? Although many studies have examined issues of parental
   investment using behavioral data, this research is often hindered by
   methodological constraints, including endogeneity and an inability to
   isolate the effects of predictor variables. This article takes an
   alternative approach by using data from an original, nationally
   representative survey experiment (N = 3,239). I assess how Americans
   believe parents should divide educational resources between siblings
   with different achievement and gender. In doing so, this article is the
   first to examine normative beliefs surrounding relative achievement,
   gender, and parental investment in siblings' education. When achievement
   is the only difference between siblings, respondents believe that lower
   achievers should receive more hands-on instructional resources and
   parental school involvement, and higher achievers should receive more
   resources that enhance cultural capital and support college enrollment.
   This pattern maps onto the way respondents divide resources between boys
   and girls. When gender is the only difference between siblings,
   respondents believe that boys should receive more instructional
   resources and parental school involvement, while girls should receive
   more cultural and college resources. When achievement and gender both
   differ, however, the effect of relative achievement typically crowds out
   the effect of gender, suggesting that respondents' evaluations of
   achievement are more persistent than their evaluations of gender.
   Implications for research on parental involvement in education are
   discussed.

AB Scholars debate whether human rights treaties and foreign aid are
   effective in achieving their stated objectives. Using data on more than
   100 developing countries over a 20- to 40-year period, we analyze the
   independent and interactive effects of the International Covenant on
   Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and development
   assistance (general and health-specific) on three population health
   outcomes: infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth, and caloric
   consumption. Pooled OLS and two-way fixed-effects analyses demonstrate
   that, in conjunction with development assistance for health, being party
   to the ICESCR improves survival-related outcomes; this is especially
   true for infant mortality. These findings do not appear to be driven by
   selection effects (with respect to ICESCR ratification) or simultaneity
   bias (with respect to aid receipt). In some cases, targeted aid promotes
   compliance with a human rights treaty that is otherwise difficult to
   implement; in other cases, ICESCR membership steers aid effects in
   different directions. Our findings challenge received wisdoms regarding
   the ineffectiveness of international human rights law and foreign aid.

   in childrearing. First, I use quantitative demographic data to
   investigate the association between kin coresidence and child survival,
   differentiating by lineage. I also examine the role of unrelated
   coresident adults. Second, I test whether coresident non-parental adults
   moderate the association between parental absence and child survival.
   Finally, I draw from qualitative interview data to investigate
   childrearing practices and beliefs, with a particular focus on parental
   absence and kin coresidence. I find that, despite the
   institutionalization of kin caregiving, coresidence with kin is not
   beneficial, and kin are unable to compensate for parental absence. The
   two-parent living arrangement is viewed as ideal, although the reality
   of childrearing in the setting is complex and fluid. While absent
   parents try to maintain support of their children, such assistance is
   insufficient in times of health crisis. Kin care for children with
   absent parents, but their willingness to assist depends on the reason
   for the absence.

AB Ethno-religious tolerance is crucial for establishing sustainable
   democracy, which is scarce in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).
   This study provides an empirically grounded and nuanced critique of
   Orientalist studies simply pointing at Islam. It presents a systematic
   analysis of the impact of religious belonging, belief, and behavior on
   social tolerance in the MENA, based on 32 uniquely synchronized Arab
   Barometer and World Values surveys. This study's major contributions are
   that it (a) provides unique empirical insights into the multifaceted
   impact of religiosity on social tolerance in the region, (b) develops
   the 3-Bs approach to a context-sensitive framework, and (c) shows that
   and explains why Islam has both negative and positive influences. The
   analyses show (i) that the degree to which people identify with their
   religion has no negative impact on social tolerance, with exception of
   the few cases in which Islamist forces hold power; (ii) that under
   "normal" circumstances orthodox-literalist believers are more tolerant
   towards others, but less so if they feel repressed or threatened in
   society (which only holds for a few cases); and (iii) that mosque
   attendance has a negative impact on ethno-religious social tolerance,
   and this effect is particularly strong if conservative Islamist states
   coercively regulate religion and its content, such as communication via
   sermons. All things considered the multifaceted 3-B approach is found to
   hold well once the MENA-specific aspects and its diverse
   society-state-religion relations are incorporated as sources of both
   possible threats and socialization.

AB An individual's identity may not appear to correspond to his or her
   beliefs and behaviors. Such incongruence may be particularly likely when
   an identity is stigmatized. We examine this dynamic in the context of
   atheists. Being an atheist has often been equated with stating a
   disbelief in God, but this ignores the distinct phenomenon of
   identifying as an atheist. This study asks what influences the
   likelihood that an individual will identify as an atheist beyond saying
   that he or she does not believe in God. Drawing upon research examining
   the social dynamics of stigma and identity, we hypothesize that having
   close friends who are atheists will support an individual's own adoption
   of the atheist label. On the other hand, we hypothesize that the
   presence of other stigmatized or at least competing identities, beliefs,
   and behaviors will serve as a barrier to an individual's adoption of the
   atheist label. These expectations are largely supported in an analysis
   of unique survey data offering separate measures of atheist
   self-identification and belief in God. This study provides a framework
   for future research to examine these dynamics in the context of other
   identities, particularly those that are stigmatized.

AB While there is a widespread belief that stable employment is important
   for social integration, stable employment careers have become less
   common in America's increasingly complex labor market. Job tenure has
   dropped, precarious work arrangements have gained prominence, long-term
   unemployment has spiked, and an increasing share of the jobless are not
   looking for work. Against this background, we investigate the linkages
   between labor market experiences and volunteer activities, as an
   indicator of people's involvement in civic life. We outline a theory on
   how transitions between labor market states-within, into, and out of the
   labor force-bring about changes in civic engagement and test our
   predictions using panel data from the Current Population Survey
   2002-2015. Contrary to what much previous research suggests, we find
   that people who become unemployed are more likely to start volunteering
   and no more likely to stop. We additionally show that people who leave
   the labor force altogether (i.e., not having a job nor looking for one)
   are more likely to stop volunteering. Conversely, entering the labor
   force, either by securing or searching for a job, is associated with an
   increase in volunteer activities. We explore the role of motivation and
   time resources in accounting for these patterns, finding among other

AB With the expansion of state surveillance and enforcement efforts in
   recent decades, a growing literature examines how those vulnerable to
   punitive state contact strategize to evade it. This article draws on
   in-depth interviews with eighty-three low-income mothers to consider
   whether and how concerns about Child Protective Services (CPS), a
   widespread presence in poor communities with the power to remove
   children from their parents, inform poor mothers' institutional
   engagement. Mothers recognized CPS reports as a risk in interactions
   with healthcare, educational, and social service systems legally
   mandated to report suspected child abuse or neglect. Departing from
   findings on responses to policing and immigration enforcement, I find
   that CPS concerns rarely prompted mothers to avoid systems wholesale.
   Within their system participation, however, mothers engaged in a
   selective or constrained visibility, concealing their hardships, home
   life, and parenting behavior from potential reporters. As reporting
   systems serve as vital sources of support for disadvantaged families,
   mothers' practices of information management, while perhaps protecting
   them from CPS reports, may preclude opportunities for assistance and
   reinforce a sense of constraint in families' institutional interactions.

AB Recent technological innovations in unconventional oil and gas (UOG)
   production have transformed the global energy landscape. The combination
   of hydraulic fracturing-commonly referred to as "fracking"-with
   horizontal drilling in shale plays across the United States has made the
   nation the top producer of both natural gas and petroleum, after a long
   hiatus from the top of the list. However, the public is largely
   marginalized from collective decisions about if, when, and where UOG
   production should occur. This marginalization occurs via lack of
   recognition and authentic participation as well as stymied community
   capacity to make decisions about zoning and regulating UOG production.
   The purpose of this article is to interrogate the procedural justice
   consequences of private participation for individual landowners as they:
   (1) negotiate leases with agents of oil and gas (O&G) companies and (2)
   work to have lease terms adequately followed by industry. To do this, we
   draw on over 100 interviews with Colorado and Pennsylvania citizens who
   have participated in private negotiations with the O&G industry
   regarding development of their land or minerals. Using these data and an
   environmental justice lens, we argue that meta-power-the power to
   structure the conditions of social contexts-frames negotiations between
   corporate actors and members of the public, shaping the outcomes of
   these interactions toward development and away from authentic
   participation by community members.

AB We analyze why domestic homicide rates in a country sending troops into
   war increase with some international wars, but not others. Drawing from
   research on the brutalization effect, we first explain how war can have
   an effect on homicides through individuals learning acceptable behavior
   from the state. Second, we explain why we observe the brutalization
   effect with some wars, but not others. We argue that illegitimate wars
   are associated with increased homicide rates, while state participation
   in legitimate wars should not affect homicide rates. Pursuing an
   illegitimate war may serve as a signal to society that norms and morals
   have been suspended, leading to a period of moral deregulation in the
   form of anomie. To test our theory, we conduct time-series analyses of
   data for the United States between 1928 and 2014. After examining the
   characteristics of eleven international wars pursued by the United
   States, we find that a brutalization effect occurs when the country
   engages in illegitimate, but not legitimate, conflicts. We also examine
   the validity of several potential alternative explanations and provide
   directions for future research.

AB In recent decades, IGOs, NGOs, private firms and even states have begun
   to regularly package and distribute information on the relative
   performance of states. From the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business
   Index to the Financial Action Task Force blacklist, global performance
   indicators (GPIs) are increasingly deployed to influence governance
   globally. We argue that GPIs derive influence from their ability to
   frame issues, extend the authority of the creator, and - most
   importantly - to invoke recurrent comparison that stimulates
   governments' concerns for their own and their country's reputation.
   Their public and ongoing ratings and rankings of states are particularly
   adept at capturing attention not only at elite policy levels but also
   among other domestic and transnational actors. GPIs thus raise new
   questions for research on politics and governance globally. What are the
   social and political effects of this form of information on discourse,
   policies and behavior? What types of actors can effectively wield GPIs
   and on what types of issues? In this symposium introduction, we define
   GPIs, describe their rise, and theorize and discuss these questions in
   light of the findings of the symposium contributions.

AB This paper highlights how international organizations can use global
   performance indicators (GPIs) to drive policy change through
   transnational market pressure. When international organizations are
   credible assessors of state policy, and when monitored countries compete
   for market resources, GPIs transmit information about country risk and
   stabilize market expectations. Under these conditions banks and
   investors may restrict access to capital in noncompliant states and
   incentivize increased compliance. I demonstrate this market-enforcement
   mechanism by analyzing the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an
   intergovernmental body that issues nonbinding recommendations to combat
   money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The FATF's public
   listing of noncompliant jurisdictions has prompted international banks
   to move resources away from listed states and raised the costs of
   continued noncompliance, significantly increasing the number of states
   with laws criminalizing terrorist financing. This finding suggests a
   powerful pathway through which institutions influence domestic policy
   and highlights the power of GPIs in an age where information is a global
   currency.

AB Precise international metrics and assessments may induce governments to
   alter policies in pursuit of more favorable assessments according to
   these metrics. In this paper, we explore a secondary effect of global
   performance indicators (GPIs). Insofar as governments have finite
   resources and make trade-offs in public goods investments, a GPI that
   precisely targets the provision of a particular public good may cause
   governments to substitute away from the provision of other, related,
   public goods. We argue that both the main effect of the GPI (on the
   measured public good) and this substitution effect vary systematically
   based on the domestic political institutions and informational
   environments of targeted states. Specifically, we contend that both the
   main and substitution effects of GPIs should be largest for governments
   that are least accountable (opaque and nondemocratic) and should be
   smallest for those that are most accountable. We illustrate the logic of
   these arguments using a formal model and test these claims using data on
   primary and secondary enrollment rates across 114 countries. We find
   that countries substitute toward primary education enrollment rates
   (which is targeted by the Millennium Development Goals) and away from
   secondary (which is not), and that these effects are mitigated as
   accountability rises.

AB Recent studies on global performance indicators (GPIs) reveal the
   distinct power that nonstate actors can accrue and exercise in world
   politics. How and when does this happen? Using a mixed-methods approach,
   we examine the impact of the Aid Transparency Index (ATI), an annual
   rating and rankings index produced by the small UK-based NGO Publish
   What You Fund. The ATI seeks to shape development aid donors' behavior
   with respect to their transparency-the quality and kind of information
   they publicly disclose. To investigate the ATI's effect, we construct an
   original panel data set of donor transparency performance before and
   after ATI inclusion (2006-2013) to test whether (and which) donors alter
   their behavior in response to inclusion in the ATI. To further probe the
   causal mechanisms that explain variations in donor behavior we use
   qualitative research, including over 150 key informant interviews
   conducted between 2010 and 2017. Our analysis uncovers the conditions
   under which the ATI influences powerful aid donors. Our mixed-methods
   evidence reveals how this happens. Consistent with Kelley and Simmons's
   central argument that GPIs exercise influence via social pressure, we
   find that the ATI shapes donor behavior primarily via direct effects on
   elites: the diffusion of professional norms, organizational learning,
   and peer pressure.

AB We argue that the World Bank has successfully marshaled the Ease of
   Doing Business (EDB) Index to amass considerable influence over business
   regulations worldwide. The Ease of Doing is a global performance
   indicator (GPI), and GPIs-especially those that rate and rank states
   against one another-are intended to package information to influence the
   views of an audience important to the target, such as foreign investors
   or voters, thus generating pressures that induce a change in the
   target's behavior. The World Bank has succeeded in shaping the global
   regulatory environment even though the bank has no explicit mandate over
   regulatory policy and despite questions about EDB accuracy and required
   policy tradeoffs. We show that the EDB has a dominating market share
   among business climate indicators. We then use media analyses and
   observational data to show that EDB has motivated state regulatory
   shifts. States respond to being publicly ranked and some restructure
   bureaucracies accordingly. Next we explore plausible influence channels
   for the EDB ranking and use an experiment involving US portfolio
   managers to build on existing economics research and examine whether the
   rankings influence investor sentiment within the experiment. Using a
   case study of India's multiyear interagency effort to rise in the EDB
   rankings, as well as its decision to create subnational EDB rankings, we
   bring the strands of the argument together by showing how politicians
   see the ranking as affecting domestic politics, altering investor
   sentiment, and engaging bureaucratic reputation. Overall, a wide variety
   of evidence converges to illustrate the pressures through which the
   World Bank has used state rankings to achieve its vision of regulatory
   reform.

AB What explains differential rates of ethnic violence in postcolonial
   Africa? I argue that ethnic groups organized as a precolonial state
   (PCS) exacerbated interethnic tensions in their postcolonial country.
   Insecure leaders in these countries traded off between inclusive
   coalitions that risked insider coups and excluding other ethnic groups
   at the possible expense of outsider rebellions. My main hypotheses posit
   that PCS groups should associate with coups because their historically
   rooted advantages often enabled accessing power at the center, whereas
   other ethnic groups in their countries-given strategic incentives for
   ethnopolitical exclusion-should fight civil wars more frequently than
   ethnic groups in countries without a PCS group. Analyzing originally
   compiled data on precolonial African states provides statistical
   evidence for these implications about civil wars and coups between
   independence and 2013 across various model specifications. Strikingly,
   through 1989, thirty of thirty-two ethnic group-level major civil war
   onsets occurred in countries with a PCS group.

AB Recent international relations scholarship has argued that political
   elites constrain the use of military force by democracies. Despite the
   persuasiveness of this research, scholars have largely ignored elite
   dynamics' ability to constrain the initiation of covert operations. This
   omission is consequential because scholars of US foreign policy often
   assume that covert operations serve as a substitute for the overt use of
   force; secrecy allows leaders to limit information to congressional
   elites and thus weaken their oversight capabilities. Do elite political
   dynamics constrain presidents' ability to act secretly or do they affect
   the overt use of force only? I argue that elite political
   constraints-particularly opposition from Congress-extend to the
   president's ability to initiate covert operations. By examining the
   trade-off between US military force and CIA-initiated covert operations
   during the Cold War, I find the likelihood that covert operations are
   initiated decreases significantly during periods of divided government
   and that there is no distinguishable trade-off between covert operations
   and overt military force. The results suggest that constraints on covert
   operations became more uniform across unified and divided government
   following congressional oversight reforms in 1975 that reduced the
   information asymmetry between the majority and minority party. These
   findings have important ramifications for the nascent literature on
   back-door bargaining and covert signalling. Because democratic leaders
   frequently face domestic political costs even when acting in secret,
   covert operations should allow leaders to credibly convey their resolve.

AB Depression is the leading cause of illness and disability in
   adolescence. Many studies show a correlation between religiosity and
   mental health, yet the question remains whether the relationship is
   causal. We exploit within-school variation in adolescents' peers to deal
   with selection into religiosity. We find robust effects of religiosity
   on depression that are stronger for the most depressed. These effects
   are not driven by the school social context; depression spreads among
   close friends rather than through broader peer groups that affect
   religiosity. Exploration of mechanisms suggests that religiosity buffers

AB With growing inequality, the American dream is becoming less effective
   as a collective myth. With its focus on material success, competition
   and self-reliance, the intensified diffusion of neoliberal scripts of
   the self is leading the upper-middle class toward a mental health crisis
   while the working class and low-income groups do not have the resources
   needed to live the dream. African Americans, Latinos and undocumented
   immigrants, who are presumed to lack self-reliance, face more rigid
   boundaries. One possible way forward is broadening cultural membership
   by promoting new narratives of hope centered on a plurality of criteria
   of worth, 'ordinary universalism' and destigmatizing stigmatized groups.

AB In this paper, I use data from the British Household Panel Survey and
   Understanding Society to investigate the social and political attitudes
   of cultural omnivores. I report a threefold typology of cultural
   consumption in the domains of music and visual arts that is consistent
   with previous research. Then by linking data across the two panel
   surveys, I show that cultural omnivores have quite a distinctive profile
   of social attitudes. Specifically, omnivores are more trusting and
   risk-taking. They hold more favourable views about the European Union,
   and they tend to eschew subnational identities. Omnivores are
   politically more engaged. But they are not more 'class conscious', nor
   are they particularly left-wing or right-wing on distributional issues.
   When asked what is important to the sense of who they are, the two most
   important status-conferring attributes, that is, profession and
   education, are not more salient to omnivores than to others. But
   omnivores are more extravert and open to new experiences. Taken
   together, these results suggest that omnivorousness is an expression of
   cosmopolitan postmaterialism rather than a new form of distinction.

AB In this article, we address the classical debate about the relationship
   between the economic and cultural aspects of social stratification,
   typically cast in terms of Weber's distinction between class and status.
   We discuss in particular Chan and Goldthorpe's influential, yet largely
   unchallenged, attempt to reinstate a strict version of the class-status
   distinction, mounted as an attack on 'Bourdieusian' accounts. We argue
   that this is unconvincing in two respects: There are fundamental
   problems with their conceptualization of status, producing a peculiar
   account where one expression of status honour explains the other; in
   addition, their portrayal of the Bourdieusian approach as
   one-dimensional is highly questionable. In contradiction of a reading of
   Bourdieu as discarding the class-status distinction, we develop an
   alternative, neo-Bourdieusian account that recognizes class and status
   as distinct aspects of stratification, thereby allowing for a subtle
   analysis of their empirical entwinement. The fruitfulness of this
   approach is demonstrated by analysing the homology between the space of
   lifestyles and the social space through Multiple Correspondence Analysis
   of unusually rich data about lifestyles. Importantly, we highlight the
   relative autonomy of these spaces: Although they exhibit a similar
   structure, they do not overlap completely.

AB The paper ethnographically explores the cultural embedding of atomistic
   indifference in online, global financial markets: arenas that have been
   digitally designed according to economic ideals and that demand an
   extreme form of relational and social dissociation from the partners to
   exchange and from those affected by the transactions. Its case-study is
   lay financial-trading in Israel, a country undergoing extensive
   neoliberalization. The study shows that dissociation is embedded in an
   economic culture marked by constant, multi-sited declarations that
   economic-Others are cold, uncaring and manipulative. It takes shape as
   traders convert the distrust towards Others into distrust towards
   portions of the Self that represent links to these Others, namely their
   own social-psychology and social concern. Acting atomistically and
   selfishly in the market thus entails considerable reflexive work. The
   paper contributes to an ongoing debate on the moral and cultural
   embeddedness of markets in general and of the expanding financial
   markets in particular.

AB Research on intra-household resource allocation practices has largely
   ignored the role of communication within but especially beyond the
   household. This article shows that discussions engaged in outside of the
   household shed light on intra-household deliberation and also contribute
   to an understanding of how norms are formed and used in discussions and
   negotiations. Using data from the website Mumsnet, and grounding our
   analysis in a framework that combines the literature on gender norms in
   allocation practices with insights from the study of online
   communication, we contribute to the sociological literature on household
   distribution in three ways: first, we show that women use discussion
   sites like Mumsnet to clarify and sometimes contest social norms
   regarding money and relationships; second, we show that users conceive
   the ability to communicate with partners as a source of 'relationship
   power' and use online discussion with other women to develop that skill;
   third, we argue that sites like Mumsnet provide fresh insights into
   household resource allocation processes. The article concludes with a
   broader discussion of the role of communication in household
   distribution and the value of online data for understanding such
   processes.

AB This paper provides a contribution to the institutionalist approach to
   money through ethnographic research carried out in two local currency
   systems in Argentina (known as trueque). It argues that Argentinian
   local currencies must be considered as monies in their own right even if
   they differ from state and bank issued currencies, because they can be
   understood as systems of evaluation and settlement of debts denominated
   in a specific unit of account (the credito). Money is said to be an
   ambivalent social relation because in the two cases studied it mediates
   very different dynamics, exacerbating inequality in one context and
   promoting collective emancipation in another. This difference is due to
   the kind of political communities that the credito tends to forge. In
   both Rosario and Poriajhu, the political community is defined by a set
   of values that legitimizes ongoing monetary practices and institutions
   rather than the State's coercion.

AB This paper examines change in school-age children's (8-16 years) time
   use in the United Kingdom between 1975 and 2015. Over this period,
   concerns for children's safety, technological change, and increased
   emphasis on success in school are widely argued to have altered
   children's daily lives, leading for example to less time outdoors, more
   time in screen-based activities, and more time focused on education.
   Using data from three national time use surveys collected in 1974-5,
   2000-01 and 2014-15, this paper explores the extent to which these
   arguments reflect actual change in how children spend their time
   throughout the day. The results show that between 1975 and 2015 children
   increased their time at home, and spent more time in screen-based
   activities and doing homework. Decreases in time in out-of-home
   activities were concentrated in time in unstructured play, partially
   offset by increased time in sport. A decomposition of trends revealed
   that, despite a narrowing of the gender gap in time in housework, gender
   remains a significant factor determining many aspects of children's time
   use. In contrast, the significance of age declined in most leisure
   activities, with the exception of screen-based activities where
   significant age differences emerged in 2000 and widened further in 2015.

AB This paper examines processes of habit reshuffling and change in
   different contexts of household formation, looking specifically at
   habits regarding eating and commensality. It is based on a study of 14
   couples, each with one English and one French partner, half of whom live
   in France, half in England. We examine the interplay between partners,
   their determination to eat together as a couple, and the various
   'orders' associated with their commensal pact (diets, routines,
   extra-marital commensality), both when they start as couples and as
   parents of young children. We draw on the specificity of cross-national
   couple experience to cast light on processes of adjustment - to one

AB Intersectionality theory is concerned with integrating social
   characteristics to better understanding complex human relations and
   inequalities in organizations and societies (McCall 2005). Recently,
   intersectionality research has taken a categorical and quantitative turn
   as scholars critically adopt but retain existing social categories to
   explain differences in labour market outcomes. A key contention is that
   social categories carry penalties or privileges and their intersection
   promotes or hinders the life chances of particular groups and
   individuals. An emergent debate is whether the intersection of
   disadvantaged characteristics (such as female gender or minority ethnic
   status) produce penalties that are additive, multiplicative or
   ameliorative. Research is inconclusive and as yet pays little attention
   to moderating factors such as employer type, size, geographic location
   or work profile. Drawing on administrative records for individuals
   qualified as solicitors in England and Wales, collected by the
   Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), combined with aggregated
   workforce data and firm characteristics of their law firms, we undertake
   a statistical analysis of the intersection of gender and ethnicity in
   the profession with a degree of precision and nuance not previously
   possible. In response to calls to broaden studies of inequalities and
   intersectionality beyond their effect on pay or income (Castilla 2008)
   we focus on career progression to partnership as our key measure of
   success. The original contribution of our study is twofold. First, we
   establish statistically different profiles of law firms, showing how the
   solicitors' profession is stratified by gender, ethnicity and
   socio-economic background, as well as the type of legal work undertaken
   by developing a model of socio-economic stratification in the
   profession. Second, we demonstrate that while penalties tend to be
   additive (i.e. the sum of the individual ethnic and gender penalties)
   this varies significantly by law firm profile and in some situations the
   effect is ameliorative.

AB How do people respond to the ways in which insurance mediates
   environmental risks? Socio-cultural risk research has characterized and
   analyzed the experiential dimension of risk, but has yet to focus on
   insurance, which is a key institution shaping how people understand and
   relate to risk. Insurance not only assesses and communicates risk; it
   also economizes it, making the problem on the ground not just one of
   risk, but also of value. This article addresses these issues with an
   investigation of the social life of the flood insurance rate map, the
   central technology of the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP),
   as it grafts a new landscape of 'value at risk' onto the physical and
   social world of New York City in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Like
   other risk technologies, ubiquitous in modern societies as
   decision-making and planning tools, the map disseminates information
   about value and risk in order to tame uncertainty and enable prudent
   action oriented toward the future. However, drawing together interview,
   ethnographic, and documentary data, I find that for its users on the
   ground, the map does not simply measure 'value at risk' in ways that
   produce clear strategies for protecting property values from flooding.
   Instead, it puts values-beyond simply the financial worth of places-at
   risk, as well as implicates past, present, and future risks beyond
   simply flooding. By informing and enlarging the stakes of what needs
   protecting, and from what, I argue that plural and interacting 'values
   at risk' shape how people live with and respond to environmental risks
   that are mediated by insurance technologies.

AB From kindergarten through college, students perceive boys as more
   intelligent than girls, yet few sociological studies have identified how
   school processes shape students' gender status beliefs. Drawing on 2.5
   years of longitudinal ethnography and 196 interviews conducted at a
   racially diverse, public middle school in Los Angeles, this article
   demonstrates how educators' differential regulation of boys'
   rule-breaking by course level contributed to gender-based differences in
   students' perceptions of intelligence. In higher-level courses-where
   affluent, White, and Asian American students were
   overrepresented-educators tolerated 6th-grade boys' rule-breaking, such
   that boys challenged girls' opinions and monopolized classroom
   conversations. By 8th grade, students perceived higher-level boys as
   more exceptionally intelligent than girls. However, in lower-level
   courses-where non-affluent Latinx students were
   overrepresented-educators penalized 6th-grade boys' rule-breaking, such
   that boys disengaged from classroom conversations. By 8th grade,
   lower-level students perceived girls as smarter than boys, but not
   exceptional. This article also demonstrates how race intersected with
   gender when shaping students' perceptions of intelligence, with students
   associating the most superlatives with affluent White boys'
   capabilities. Through this analysis, I develop a new theoretical
   understanding of how school processes contribute to the gendered social
   construction of exceptionalism and reproduce social inequalities in
   early adolescence.

AB Individual preferences for same-ethnic friends contribute to persistent
   segregation of adolescents' friendship networks. Yet, we know
   surprisingly little about the mechanisms behind ethnic homophily. Prior
   research suggests that ethnic homophily is ubiquitous, but a social
   identity perspective indicates that strong ingroup identification drives
   ingroup favoritism. Combining a social identity perspective with a
   relational approach, we ask whether the presumed increased homophily of
   high identifiers extends to all ingroup members, or whether it is
   conditional on the strength of same-ethnics' identification. We propose
   that the strength of ethnic identification affects not only how much
   individuals desire same-ethnic friends, but also how attractive they are
   as potential friends to others. Fitting stochastic actor-oriented models
   to German adolescent school-based network panel data, we find that
   ethnic homophily is driven by an interplay of peers' ethnic
   identification: high identifiers befriend same-ethnic peers who share
   their strong ethnic identification, while excluding same-ethnic low
   identifiers. Low identifiers, in turn, tend to avoid befriending
   inter-ethnic high identifiers. Our relational approach reveals that
   ethnic homophily is hardly ubiquitous but requires strong identification
   of both parties of a (potential) friendship.

AB When do protest organizations borrow issues or claims that are outside
   their traditional domains? Sociologists have examined the consequences
   of borrowing claims across movement boundaries, but not the antecedents
   of doing so. We argue that movement boundaries are strong when there is
   consensus about the core claims of a social movement, which we measure
   by cohesion and focus. Cohesion and focus enhance the legitimacy of a
   movement and impede member organizations from adopting claims associated
   with other movements. Analyzing movement organizational activity at
   U.S.-based protest events from 1960 to 1995, we find that a social
   movement organization is less likely to adopt claims from other
   movements when the social movement in which it is embedded exhibits high
   cohesion and focus. However, when movement organizations do borrow
   claims, they are more likely to do so by borrowing from movements that
   themselves exhibit high cohesion and focus. We describe the application
   of our findings to organization theory, social movements, and field
   theoretic approaches to understanding social action.

AB Intergenerational mobility is higher among college graduates than among
   people with lower levels of education. In light of this finding,
   researchers have characterized a college degree as a great equalizer
   leveling the playing field, and proposed that expanding higher education
   would promote mobility. This line of reasoning rests on the implicit
   assumption that the relatively high mobility observed among college
   graduates reflects a causal effect of college completion on
   intergenerational mobility, an assumption that has rarely been
   rigorously evaluated. This article bridges this gap. Using a novel
   reweighting technique, I estimate the degree of intergenerational income
   mobility among college graduates purged of selection processes that may
   drive up observed mobility in this subpopulation. Analyzing data from
   the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, I find that once
   selection processes are adjusted for, intergenerational income mobility
   among college graduates is very close to that among non-graduates. This
   finding suggests that expanding the pool of college graduates per se is
   unlikely to boost intergenerational income mobility in the United
   States. To promote mobility, public investments in higher education
   (e.g., federal and state student aid programs) should be targeted at
   low-income youth.

AB In this article, I build a new line of health inequality research that
   parallels the emerging structural racism literature. I develop theory
   and measurement for the concept of structural sexism and examine its
   relationship to health outcomes. Consistent with contemporary theories
   of gender as a multilevel social system, I conceptualize and measure
   structural sexism as systematic gender inequality at the macro level
   (U.S. state), meso level (marital dyad), and micro level (individual). I
   use U.S. state-level administrative data linked to geocoded data from
   the NLSY79, as well as measures of inter-spousal inequality and
   individual views on women's roles as predictors of physical health
   outcomes in random-effects models for men and women. Results show that
   among women, exposure to more sexism at the macro and meso levels is
   associated with more chronic conditions, worse self-rated health, and
   worse physical functioning. Among men, macro-level structural sexism is
   also associated with worse health. However, greater meso-level
   structural sexism is associated with better health among men. At the
   micro level, internalized sexism is not related to physical health among
   either women or men. I close by outlining how future research on gender
   inequality and health can be furthered using a structural sexism
   perspective.

AB The "socioeconomic achievement gap"-the disparity in academic
   achievement between students from high- and low-socioeconomic status
   (SES) backgrounds-is well-known in the sociology of education. The SES
   achievement gap has been documented across a wide range of countries.
   Yet in most countries, we do not know whether the SES achievement gap
   has been changing over time. This study combines 30 international
   large-scale assessments over 50 years, representing 100 countries and
   about 5.8 million students. SES achievement gaps are computed between
   the 90th and 10th percentiles of three available measures of family SES:
   parents' education, parents' occupation, and the number of books in the
   home. Results indicate that, for each of the three SES variables
   examined, achievement gaps increased in a majority of sample countries.
   Yet there is substantial cross-national variation in the size of
   increases in SES achievement gaps. The largest increases are observed in
   countries with rapidly increasing school enrollments, implying that
   expanding access reveals educational inequality that was previously
   hidden outside the school system. However, gaps also increased in many
   countries with consistently high enrollments, suggesting that cognitive
   skills are an increasingly important dimension of educational
   stratification worldwide.

   activities, we ask, what are public ideas and how do they come to be?
   More specifically, how do journalists and other mediators between the

   of these ideas develop over time and shape the public careers of these
   ideas? How do these processes help us understand public ideas and

   case for a sociology of public social science. Using data from newspaper
   articles that engage with seven of the most publicly prominent social
   science ideas over the past 30 years, we make three contributions.
   First, we advance a pragmatic, cultural approach to understanding public
   ideas, one that emphasizes fit-making processes and applicative
   flexibility. Second, we define public ideas: social science ideas become
   public ideas when they are used as objects of interest (being the news),
   are used as interpretants (making sense of the news), and ebb and flow
   between these uses as part of an unfolding career. Third, we construct a
   typology of public ideas that provides an architecture for future

   focusing on repeated interactions that provide the opportunity for
   profitable cooperation. Our experimental method creates two groups of
   subjects who have different levels of certain traits, such as higher or
   lower levels of Intelligence, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness, but
   who are very similar otherwise. Intelligence has a large and positive
   long-run effect on cooperative behavior. The effect is strong when at
   the equilibrium of the repeated game there is a trade-off between
   short-run gains and long-run losses. Conscientiousness and Agreeableness
   have a natural, significant but transitory effect on cooperation rates.

   These price responses are largest in zip codes with many homeowners and
   are driven by changes in markups rather than local costs. We argue that
   markups rise with house prices because greater housing wealth reduces
   homeowners' demand elasticity, and firms raise markups in response.
   Shopping data confirm that house price changes affect the price

   across US states and federal tax changes generate variation in regional
   tax shocks that I exploit to test for heterogeneous effects. I find that
   the positive relationship between tax cuts and employment growth is

AB We develop a dynamic trade model with spatially distinct labor markets
   facing varying exposure to international trade. The model captures the
   role of labor mobility frictions, goods mobility frictions, geographic
   factors, and input-output linkages in determining equilibrium
   allocations. We show how to solve the equilibrium of the model and take
   the model to the data without assuming that the economy is at a steady
   state and without estimating productivities, migration frictions, or
   trade costs, which can be difficult to identify. We calibrate the model
   to 22 sectors, 38 countries, and 50 U.S. states. We study how the rise
   in China's trade for the period 2000 to 2007 impacted U.S. households
   across more than a thousand U.S. labor markets distinguished by sector
   and state. We find that the China trade shock resulted in a reduction of
   about 0.55 million U.S. manufacturing jobs, about 16% of the observed
   decline in manufacturing employment from 2000 to 2007. The U.S. gains in
   the aggregate, but due to trade and migration frictions, the welfare and
   employment effects vary across U.S. labor markets. Estimated transition
   costs to the new long-run equilibrium are also heterogeneous and reflect
   the importance of accounting for labor dynamics.

AB This paper begins by observing that any reflexive binary (preference)
   relation (over risky prospects) that satisfies the independence axiom
   admits a form of expected utility representation. We refer to this
   representation notion as the coalitional minmax expected utility
   representation. By adding the remaining properties of the expected
   utility theorem, namely, continuity, completeness, and transitivity, one
   by one, we find how this representation gets sharper and sharper,
   thereby deducing the versions of this classical theorem in which any
   combination of these properties is dropped from its statement. This
   approach also allows us to weaken transitivity in this theorem, rather
   than eliminate it entirely, say, to quasitransitivity or acyclicity.
   Apart from providing a unified dissection of the expected utility
   theorem, these results are relevant for the growing literature on
   boundedly rational choice in which revealed preference relations often
   lack the properties of completeness and/or transitivity (but often
   satisfy the independence axiom). They are also especially suitable for
   the (yet overlooked) case in which the decision-maker is made up of
   distinct individuals and, consequently, transitivity is routinely
   violated. Finally, and perhaps more importantly, we show that our
   representation theorems allow us to answer many economic questions that
   are posed in terms of nontransitive/incomplete preferences, say, about
   the maximization of preferences, the existence of Nash equilibrium, the
   preference for portfolio diversification, and the possibility of the
   preference reversal phenomenon.

AB Half of U.S. 50-year-olds will experience a nursing home stay before
   they die, and one in ten will incur out-of-pocket long-term care
   expenses in excess of $200,000. Surprisingly, only about 10% of
   individuals over age 62 have private long-term care insurance (LTCI) and
   LTCI takeup rates are low at all wealth levels. We analyze the
   contributions of Medicaid, administrative costs, and asymmetric
   information about nursing home entry risk to low LTCI takeup rates in a
   quantitative equilibrium contracting model. As in practice, the insurer
   in the model assigns individuals to risk groups based on noisy
   indicators of their nursing home entry risk. All individuals in frail
   and/or low-income risk groups are denied coverage because the cost of
   insuring any individual in these groups exceeds that individual's
   willingness-to-pay. Individuals in insurable risk groups are offered a
   menu of contracts whose terms vary across risk groups. We find that
   Medicaid accounts for low LTCI takeup rates of poorer individuals.
   However, administrative costs and adverse selection are responsible for
   low takeup rates of the rich. The model reproduces other empirical
   features of the LTCI market including the fact that owners of LTCI have
   about the same nursing home entry rates as non-owners.

AB Fan, Liao, and Yao (2015) recently introduced a remarkable method for
   increasing the asymptotic power of tests in high-dimensional testing
   problems. If applicable to a given test, their power enhancement
   principle leads to an improved test that has the same asymptotic size,
   has uniformly non-inferior asymptotic power, and is consistent against a
   strictly broader range of alternatives than the initially given test. We
   study under which conditions this method can be applied and show the
   following: In asymptotic regimes where the dimensionality of the
   parameter space is fixed as sample size increases, there often exist
   tests that cannot be further improved with the power enhancement
   principle. However, when the dimensionality of the parameter space
   increases sufficiently slowly with sample size and a marginal local
   asymptotic normality (LAN) condition is satisfied, every test with
   asymptotic size smaller than 1 can be improved with the power
   enhancement principle. While the marginal LAN condition alone does not
   allow one to extend the latter statement to all rates at which the
   dimensionality increases with sample size, we give sufficient conditions
   under which this is the case.

AB We propose a framework to identify and estimate earnings distributions
   and worker composition on matched panel data, allowing for two-sided
   worker-firm unobserved heterogeneity and complementarities in earnings.
   We introduce two models: a static model that allows for nonlinear
   interactions between workers and firms, and a dynamic model that allows,
   in addition, for Markovian earnings dynamics and endogenous mobility. We
   show that this framework nests a number of structural models of wages
   and worker mobility. We establish identification in short panels, and
   develop tractable two-step estimators where firms are classified in a
   first step. Applying our method to Swedish administrative data, we find
   that log-earnings are approximately additive in worker and firm
   heterogeneity. Our estimates imply the presence of strong sorting
   patterns between workers and firms, and a small contribution of
   firms-net of worker composition-to earnings dispersion. In addition, we
   document that wages have a direct effect on mobility, and that, beyond
   their dependence on the current firm, earnings after a job move also
   depend on the previous employer.

   equilibrium is guaranteed for more classes of purely-complements than of
   purely-substitutes, preferences. Our Intersection Count Theorem checks

   systematic analysis of how Title IX has been mobilized at the

   filed with the Office for Civil Rights against four-year nonprofit
   colleges and universities from 1994 to 2014. I find that the
   mobilization of Title IX has changed both in frequency and in kind
   during this period. Filings started to rise after 2000 and exploded
   after 2009, while sexual harassment complaints nearly equaled academic
   and athletic filings for the first time in 2014. Private, more selective
   institutions as well as schools located in states with more women
   serving in state legislatures face a disproportionate number of
   complaints relative to enrollment, indicating the importance of
   institutional context to legal mobilization.

   observation that a country's exogenous demographic composition can be

   to die from and, in turn, the drugs they are most likely to demand. We
   find that the correlation between predicted home demand and sales abroad
   is positive and greater than the correlation between predicted home
   demand and purchases from abroad. In short, countries tend to be net

AB Does religion promote or deter political activism? Most arguments and
   evidence on this question do not account for variation by social
   position. We argue that for the 2006 spring immigrant rights marches
   understanding the influence of religion on participation requires a
   careful assessment of the relationship between various dimensions of
   religion and the risks, barriers, and motivations that are rooted in
   citizenship status of potential participants. Dimensions that enhance
   efficacy are important for overcoming the participation obstacles that
   noncitizens faced. In contrast, dimensions that contributed to
   solidarity, opportunities, and framing fostered citizens' mobilization.
   Our findings from the Pew Hispanic Center and the Pew Forum on Religion
   and Public Life national survey of Latinos are consistent with the view
   that Charismatic identity and a salient personal religious faith were
   sources of empowerment that inspired noncitizen participation.
   Conversely, the emphasis on "law and order" of the biblical literalist
   as well as the pietistic orientation of a faith marked by personal
   prayer hindered marching among Latino noncitizens. Catholic and mainline
   Protestant traditions and a close association between faith and politics
   influenced citizen protest but not noncitizen involvement. Integration
   into congregations activated for immigrant rights and involvement in
   congregation-based volunteerism encouraged participation for both
   citizens and noncitizens.

AB A well-established body of research focuses on the relationship between

   separate literature examines the effects of victim race in criminal
   punishment. Despite their close association, few attempts have been made
   to integrate these related lines of empirical inquiry in the sociology
   of punishment. In this article, we address this issue by examining
   relationships among criminal threat, victim race, and punitive sentiment
   toward black and Latino defendants. We analyze nationally representative
   survey data that include both subjective and objective measures of
   criminal threat, and we incorporate unique information on
   victim/offender dyads to test research questions about the that role
   victim race plays in the formation of anti-black and anti-Latino
   sentiment in the criminal justice system. The results indicate that both
   subjective perceptions of criminal threat and minority population growth
   are significantly related to punitiveness among whites, and that
   punitive sentiment is enhanced in situations that involve minority
   offenders and white victims. Moreover, we show that aggregate indicators
   of racial threat strongly condition the effect of victim race on
   punitive attitudes. Implications of these findings are discussed in
   relation to racial group threat theories and current perspectives on the
   exercise of state-sponsored social control.

AB In this article, we argue that an exclusive focus on the generalized
   aspect of prejudice limits understanding of the structure and genesis of
   prejudice towards particular outgroups. In order to conceptualize the
   specific nature of particular prejudices, we propose the differentiated
   threat approach. This framework postulates that different outgroups
   challenge diverse realistic and symbolic interests, and that these
   outgroup specific threats affect various socioeconomic strata and
   cultural groups differentially. The differentiated threat approach is
   applied to analyse majority-group Belgians' attitudes towards
   immigrants, Muslims, Jews, and homosexuals. The results show that a
   common denominator of prejudice can be distinguished, but that the
   prejudices towards the various outgroups contain substantively relevant
   unique components that are influenced by socio-demographic and
   attitudinal predictors in diverging ways. Gender traditionalism is found
   to reinforce Homonegativity and temper Islamophobia at the same time.
   Feelings of relative deprivation are more strongly related to
   Islamophobia than to other forms of prejudice, and are unrelated to
   homonegativity. Religious involvement plays a more decisive role in the
   formation of anti-Semitism and Homonegativity than it does in the other
   forms of prejudice. Anti-immigration attitudes show a class gradient
   that is absent in attitudes towards other outgroups. Our results
   evidence that the concrete realization of attitudes towards a specific
   outgroup cannot be understood without paying attention to structural and
   contextual factors, such as social positions, the nature of intergroup
   relations, power balances, and elite discourses.

   allocation decisions under conditions of uncertainty by examining how
   they spend and save their tax refunds. Using data from in-depth
   interviews with a sample of 115 lower-income working families, we find
   that more than three quarters of families experienced an income or
   expense shock in the past three years. Although many had aspirations for
   upward mobility, the insecurity of daily life meant they devoted most of
   their refund dollars to creating a personal safety net to cushion
   against income and expense shocks. What appeared to be distinct types of
   allocations often had the same underlying rationale goal of improving a
   family's economic security in the near term. By saving, purchasing
   durable goods, stockpiling household staples, and paying off debts to
   kin and creditors at tax refund time, families leveraged their tax
   refund dollars into multiple forms of self-insurance. Respondents held
   aspirations for upward mobility that correspond strongly with those of
   middle-class Americans, but they did not feel they had the luxury of
   setting aside resources for long-term mobility goals given the
   instability and insecurity of their work and family lives. Instead, they
   invested their refunds in more precautionary ways. What might be viewed
   as current consumption by outsiders was actually a form of in-kind
   investment that occurred outside the purview of the formal banking
   system.

AB Despite the work's social importance, nurturant and reproductive care
   workers earn less than others with comparable human capital and work
   demands. We explore three broad questions related to pay for care work.
   First, we examine nurturant and reproductive care penalties together to
   investigate what mechanisms produce the lower wages for these workers.
   Second, we examine how occupational closure through education
   credentials and licensing requirements creates varying returns to care
   work. Finally, we explore the roles of wage equalizing
   institutions-labor unions and government sector care provision-in
   reducing wage disparities associated with care work. Using the 1979-2012
   waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and
   fixed-effects regression models, we find that selection on stable
   factors and human capital differences explain much of the lower wages
   for reproductive workers, but none of the low wages of nurturant
   workers. However, compared to non-care workers, college-educated
   nurturant care workers receive lower returns to work experience,
   suggesting limitations in how much learning can increase efficiency in
   care work, given the labor intensive, face-to-face nature of much of it.
   Occupational closure matters: care jobs with the highest educational and
   licensing requirements pay a wage bonus, while less closed care
   occupations incur a penalty. Wage equalizing institutions have both
   floor and ceiling effects on care worker wages that mitigate care
   penalties for selected workers: women reproductive workers and women in
   low-education/high-licensing occupations. More consistently, ceiling
   effects of these institutions lower the wages of otherwise higher paid
   care workers: nurturant and high-education/high licensing occupations.

AB Recent scholarship expresses concerns that U.S. corporations are too
   focused on short-term performance, undermining their long-term
   competitiveness. The authors examine how short-term strategies and
   performance, or short-termism, results from the dissolution of the
   American corporate elite network. They argue that the corporate board
   interlock network traditionally served as a collective resource that
   helped corporate elites to preserve their autonomy and control,
   mitigating short-termism. In recent years, changing board-appointment
   practices have fractured the board network, undermining its usefulness
   as a platform for collective action and exposing corporate leaders to
   short-term pressures. The authors develop and apply a cohesion metric
   for network managerialism, derived from theory and evidence in
   social-network scholarship. Using three indicators that capture
   short-termism earnings management and shareholder returns, the authors
   identify a structural basis for short-termism that links network-based
   resources to managers' decisions. The results highlight the benefits of
   the corporate elite network and illustrate unforeseen consequences of
   the network's dissolution.

AB The retrenchment of court-ordered school desegregation has been more
   variable and incomplete than often acknowledged, challenging common
   accounts that blame changes in federal policy and legal precedent. This
   study supplements these accounts by examining local factors that
   influenced whether and when desegregation orders were dismissed between
   1970 and 2013. After accounting for federal policy changes and
   districts' variable success in desegregating schools, several ostensibly
   race-neutral organizational, financial, and political incentives appear
   to influence the survival of desegregation orders. Racial competition
   dynamics related to local racial composition also seem to play a role,
   as desegregation orders have been most vulnerable when and where black
   population shares surpass a tipping point of about 40%.

PD MAY 2019

AB Since the 1980s, neoliberal policies have been diffused around the world
   by international institutions established to support a very different
   world order. This article examines the repurposing of the International
   Monetary Fund (IMF) to become the world's leading promoter of free
   markets. Social scientists commonly point to two modes of global-level
   institutional change: formal and fundamental transformations, like
   renegotiated treaties, or informal and incremental changes of a modest
   nature. The case of the IMF fits neither of these molds: it underwent a
   major transformation but without change in its formal foundations.
   Relying on archival material and interviews, the authors show that
   fundamental-yet-informal change was effected through a process of norm
   substitution-the alteration of everyday assumptions about the
   appropriateness of a set of activities. This transformation was led by
   the United States and rested on three pillars: mobilization of resources
   and allies, normalization of new practices, and symbolic work to
   stabilize the new modus operandi. This account denaturalizes neoliberal
   globalization and illuminates the clandestine politics behind its rise.

AB Across a wide variety of topics and methodological approaches,
   researchers find that meaning is segregated along sociodemographic
   lines. Using real-world data, this article evaluates and helps reconcile
   the often-theorized but rarely tested mechanisms that segregate meaning.
   Shared meaning is defined as both greater agreement on a cultural
   object's interpretive dimensions and a similar schema organizing how
   these interpretive dimensions interrelate. The setting is 21 book groups
   across the United States, all discussing the same previously unknown
   novel. The authors find that, through their interactions with similar
   others, the meanings individuals make out of cultural objects rapidly
   become demographically situated as individuals resonate with one another
   and the work itself. Results indicate that sociodemographically
   segregated meanings for even nonideological cultural objects may be the
   routine outcome of social structure and interaction. Researchers, by
   focusing largely on snapshots of segregated meanings on specific issues
   rather than on meaning-making processes, may contribute to an overly
   ingrained view of a divided culture.

PD MAY 2019
PY 2019
AB This study examines trends in intergenerational class mobility in China
   by analyzing six comparable, nationally representative surveys between
   1996 and 2012. Defying a simplistic, unidirectional account, the authors
   report two countervailing trends in social mobility in post-revolution
   China. On the one hand, the authors find a decline in social fluidity
   following China's transition from state socialism to a market economy,
   as the link between origin and destination in vertical social status has
   significantly strengthened. On the other hand, horizontal mobility
   between the agricultural and nonagricultural sectors has increased
   substantially during recent decades. To put these trends in a global
   context, the authors compare China's experience with those in 11
   advanced industrial countries. The authors find that despite its recent
   decline, social fluidity in China is still high by international
   standards. Yet, the direction of vertical social mobility trends in
   China stands in contrast with that in mature capitalist countries, in
   which the class structure has either stayed stable or become more open
   over time.

AB This paper develops a model of the nursing home industry to investigate
   the quality effects of policies that either raise regulated
   reimbursement rates or increase local competition. Using data from
   Pennsylvania, I estimate the parameters of the model. The findings
   indicate that nursing homes increase the quality of care, measured by
   the number of skilled nurses per resident, by 8.7 percent following a
   universal 10 percent increase in Medicaid reimbursement rates. In
   contrast, I find that pro-competitive policies lead to only small
   increases in skilled nurse staffing ratios, suggesting that Medicaid
   increases are more cost effective in raising the quality of care.

   is a unique form of public diplomacy through which rebels project a
   favorable image to gain that support. It analyzes the Libyan civil war,
   during which rebels invested considerable resources in diplomatic
   efforts to gain US support. The study entails collecting original data,
   and finds that rebel public diplomacy via Twitter increases co-operation
   with the rebels when their message (1) clarifies the type of regime they
   intend to create and (2) emphasizes the atrocities perpetrated by the
   government. Providing rebels with an important tool of image projection,
   social media can affect dynamics in an ever more connected international
   arena.

AB Political scientists lack domain-specific measures for the purpose of
   measuring the sophistication of political communication. We
   systematically review the shortcomings of existing approaches, before
   developing a new and better method along with software tools to apply
   it. We use crowdsourcing to perform thousands of pairwise comparisons of
   text snippets and incorporate these results into a statistical model of
   sophistication. This includes previously excluded features such as parts
   of speech and a measure of word rarity derived from dynamic term
   frequencies in the Google Books data set. Our technique not only shows
   which features are appropriate to the political domain and how, but also
   provides a measure easily applied and rescaled to political texts in a
   way that facilitates probabilistic comparisons. We reanalyze the State
   of the Union corpus to demonstrate how conclusions differ when using our
   improved approach, including the ability to compare complexity as a
   function of covariates.

   an immediate trend break in the fraction of male children following the
   reform. Among second births that followed a firstborn girl, sex ratios
   increased from 1.1 to 1.3 boys per girl in the 4 years following reform.
   Larger increases are found among families with more education. The land
   reform estimate is robust to controlling for the county-level rollout of
   the One Child Policy. Overall, we estimate land reform accounted for
   about 1 million missing girls.

   effects of clean water and effective sewerage systems on under-5
   mortality. Our case is Massachusetts, 1880-1920, when authorities
   developed a sewerage and water district in the Boston area. We find the
   two interventions were complementary and together account for
   approximately one-third of the decline in log child mortality during the
   41 years. Our findings are relevant to the developing world and suggest

AB Scholars have long argued that international organizations solve
   information problems through increased transparency. This article
   introduces a distinct problem that instead requires such institutions to
   keep information secret. We argue that states often seek to reveal
   intelligence about other states' violations of international rules and
   laws but are deterred by concerns about revealing the sources and
   methods used to collect it. Properly equipped international
   organizations, however, can mitigate these dilemmas by analyzing and
   acting on sensitive information while protecting it from wide
   dissemination. Using new data on intelligence disclosures to the
   International Atomic Energy Agency and an analysis of the full universe
   of nuclear proliferation cases, we demonstrate that strengthening the
   agency's intelligence protection capabilities led to greater
   intelligence sharing and fewer suspected nuclear facilities. However,
   our theory suggests that this solution gives informed states a subtle
   form of influence and is in tension with the normative goal of
   international transparency.

AB Labor market competition theories explaining anti-immigrant attitudes
   have received limited or no empirical validation in recent literature.
   This has led researchers to highlight education and cultural values as
   the main, if not the sole, drivers of attitudes toward immigration. We
   present a new labor market competition theory focusing on job
   availability rather than foreign labor supply. This theory predicts that
   individuals with low transferable skills in the labor market will
   articulate a subjective sense of job insecurity and higher hostility
   toward migrants. Our cross-classified, longitudinal, and
   difference-in-differences models reveal that skill specificity is a
   strong driver of anti-immigrant attitudes, and they suggest that
   economic competition theories cannot be dismissed. By shifting the
   attention from supply to demand in the labor market, and from actual to
   potential competition with migrants, we show that the highly educated
   are far from immune to anti-immigrant attitudes.

AB Our article examines whether a politician charging a political
   candidate's implicit racial campaign appeal as racist is an effective
   political strategy. According to the racial priming theory, this
   racialized counterstrategy should deactivate racism, thereby decreasing
   racially conservative whites' support for the candidate engaged in race
   baiting. We propose an alternative theory in which racial liberals, and
   not racially conservative whites, are persuaded by this strategy. To
   test our theory, we focused on the 2016 presidential election. We ran an
   experiment varying the politician (by party and race) calling an
   implicit racial appeal by Donald Trump racist. We find that charging
   Trump's campaign appeal as racist does not persuade racially
   conservative whites to decrease support for Trump. Rather, it causes
   racially liberal whites to evaluate Trump more unfavorably. Our results
   hold up when attentiveness, old-fashioned racism, and partisanship are
   taken into account. We also reproduce our findings in two replication
   studies.

   insignificant effect either on registration or voter turnout in the 2013
   presidential elections. Households that received door-to-door canvassing
   treatment were 4.6 percentage points more likely to vote. Experimental
   variation on the intensity of the treatment at the locality level allows
   us to estimate spillover effects, which are present in localities that
   are geographically more concentrated, which may favor social
   interactions and diffusion of information. Reinforcement effects on the
   already treated population are twice as large as diffusion effects on
   the untreated. Our results underscore the importance of taking into
   account urbanization patterns when designing informational campaigns.

AB Preventing climate change and damage from natural disasters typically
   requires policies with up-front costs that promise a flow of benefits
   over time. Why has obtaining such policies in a competitive electoral
   democracy proved so intractable? We develop a formal model of electoral
   accountability in this context, in which politicians have private
   information about their motivations. The model shows why fully rational
   voters, though certain that incumbents spend less on disaster prevention
   than is good for them, reelect incumbents at very high rates. In
   addition, in such equilibria, voters would punish incumbents who spent
   more on disaster prevention. This equilibrium is consistent with (and
   implies) some of the major empirical regularities observed in the
   literature on voting and disaster prevention. We discuss some
   implications of our analysis for advancing public debates about disaster
   and climate change mitigation.

AB Dissident violence inflicts many costs on society, but some of the
   longest-lasting consequences for civilians may be indirect, due to the
   government's response. We explore how government policy responses affect
   social welfare, specifically through budgetary shifts. Using subnational
   violence and budgeting data for Peru, we demonstrate that attacks on
   soldiers during the budget negotiation period drive a shift from local
   social services, especially health, to defense. One soldier fatality
   implies a 0.13 percentage point reduction in the local health budget
   share (2008-12). Health budget cuts due to a single soldier fatality
   result in 76 predicted additional infant deaths 2 years later. We show
   that the effect on health budgeting operates through decreases in

AB Popular psychological accounts argue that successful candidates address
   their appeals to citizens' "hearts" rather than their "heads." Yet
   research on campaigns shows that candidates win elections by getting
   voters to think about particular issues-especially issues that create
   ambivalence in the minds of opposition supporters. This article helps to
   reconcile these "heart-centered" and "head-centered" accounts of
   preference formation during campaigns. An original experiment and ANES
   data analyses (1980-2004) show that a "good gut feeling" toward a
   candidate helps citizens to overcome the paralyzing effect of
   ambivalence on attitude formation and turnout. And, since turnout is
   most tenuous among those with lower income, this is where the effect is
   most pronounced. Since Democratic candidates rely disproportionately on
   support from these lower-income voters, it is particularly important
   that they inspire positive affect among latent supporters.

AB We show that Brazilian voters strongly sanction malfeasant mayors when
   presented with hypothetical scenarios but take no action when given the
   same information about their own mayor. Partnering with the State
   Accounts Court of Pernambuco, we conducted a field experiment during the
   2016 municipal elections in which the treatment group received
   information about official wrongdoing by their mayor. The treatment has
   no effect on self-reported voting behavior after the election, yet when
   informing about malfeasance in the context of a vignette experiment, we
   are able to replicate the strong negative effect found in prior studies.
   We argue that voters' behavior in the abstract reflects the
   comparatively strong norm against corruption in Brazil. Yet on Election
   Day, their behavior is constrained by factors such as attitudes toward
   local political dynasties and the greater salience of more pressing
   concerns like employment and health services.

AB How well does public policy represent mass preferences in U.S. states?
   Current approaches provide an incomplete account of statehouse democracy
   because they fail to compare preferences and policies on meaningful
   scales. Here, we overcome this problem by generating estimates of
   Americans' preferences on the minimum wage and compare them to observed
   policies both within and across states. Because we measure both
   preferences and policies on the same scale (U.S. dollars), we can
   quantify both the association of policy outcomes with preferences across
   states (responsiveness) and their deviation within states (bias). We
   demonstrate that while minimum wages respond to corresponding
   preferences across states, policy outcomes are more conservative than
   preferences in each state, with the average policy bias amounting to
   about two dollars. We also show that policy bias is substantially
   smaller in states with access to direct democratic institutions.

   expectations have been offered about public approval of repression, many
   of them have not been directly tested. We analyze the effects of
   differing opposition tactics, differing government tactics, and legal
   constraints on approval of repression through a series of survey
   experiments in India, Israel, and Argentina. Our results indicate that
   violent action by opposition groups consistently increases support for
   government repression. In the context of contentious politics, we find
   that the effects of international law vary by national context. While
   our respondents in India were less likely to approve of their government
   when told the government violated international law, the same
   information likely increased approval of the government in our Israel
   experiment. The findings provide insights into the microfoundations of
   existing theories and suggest areas for theory refinement.

AB Recently, election administration has been an important part of the

   important issue of election administration spending has not been
   examined extensively, and the influence of politics on election
   administration spending levels has not been examined in the United
   States. While theories of voter turnout and policy preference suggest
   that politics should influence election administration spending levels
   in the counties that administer elections, to our knowledge, there has
   been no evidence produced to support a partisan election administration
   expenditure effect. This research finds that Republican county
   commissions in North Carolina spend significantly less on election
   administration once the county electorate is a sufficient Republican
   majority. The article presents a novel model and method for estimating
   election administration spending and calls for additional research to
   examine the outcomes of these significant differences in spending on
   election administration.

AB This article defends an essentialist account of culture against the
   recent turn toward nonessentialism in contemporary liberal
   multiculturalism. It does so by drawing on Friedrich Nietzsche's early
   period and argues that Nietzsche provides an alternative to the dominant
   tradition of Volk conceptions of culture that derive from J. G. Herder.
   Nietzsche's alternative-what I call the "Exemplar Account" of
   culture-defines culture in terms of the patterns of human excellence
   that constitute it. This alternative overcomes standard concerns about
   essentialism by embracing the nonessentialist insight into the fluidity
   and variability of any culture's beliefs, values, and practices, yet
   holds that exemplary lives transcend the flux of culture and individuate
   one culture from another. I suggest in conclusion a practical benefit of
   this conception of culture for contemporary multiculturalism-namely, it
   fares better than other conceptions in fostering integration among
   diverse cultures, a pressing worry facing the current project of
   multiculturalism.

AB Many researchers use unit fixed effects regression models as their
   default methods for causal inference with longitudinal data. We show
   that the ability of these models to adjust for unobserved time-invariant
   confounders comes at the expense of dynamic causal relationships, which
   are permitted under an alternative selection-on-observables approach.
   Using the nonparametric directed acyclic graph, we highlight two key
   causal identification assumptions of unit fixed effects models: Past
   treatments do not directly influence current outcome, and past outcomes
   do not affect current treatment. Furthermore, we introduce a new
   nonparametric matching framework that elucidates how various unit fixed
   effects models implicitly compare treated and control observations to
   draw causal inference. By establishing the equivalence between matching
   and weighted unit fixed effects estimators, this framework enables a
   diverse set of identification strategies to adjust for unobservables in
   the absence of dynamic causal relationships between treatment and
   outcome variables. We illustrate the proposed methodology through its
   application to the estimation of GATT membership effects on dyadic trade
   volume.

AB The aim of this study is to unravel the impact of societal change in
   West Germany on educational attainment and its attendant social
   disparities for cohorts born between 1919 and 1986. Therefore, we
   analyse whether modernization trends have modified access to, and
   success in, general, vocational, and higher education for consecutive
   birth cohorts. To explain how these processes have affected class
   differentials in educational attainment, we assume that the interplay of
   the changing occupational structure at the macro level and
   intergenerational status maintenance via investment in the education of
   offspring is-among other influences-the key mechanism for long-term
   educational expansion and for decreasing inequalities of opportunity in
   the educational system. The empirical bases of our investigation are
   clusters of time series for macro changes and retrospective individual
   data for 11 birth cohorts from the German Life History Study and the
   National Educational Panel Study for educational outcomes. We apply
   piecewise exponential event-history models to analyse the direct and
   indirect impacts of societal change on educational trajectories and
   social disparities in educational attainment. The results provide an
   understanding of historical variations in educational transitions and
   attainment associated with modernization in the social, political,
   economic, and cultural spheres.

AB Girls have a substantial advantage over boys in terms of reading
   performance throughout all OECD countries. This paper investigates
   whether the structure of a country's educational system is related to
   this gender inequality in reading performance. We assess whether
   standardization of educational curricula and the age at which students
   are selected into educational tracks affect boys' and girls' reading
   performance differently. To test our hypotheses, we employ data from all
   six Programme for International Student Achievement waves enriched with
   contextual information on countries' educational systems (N =
   1,425,356). Results show that in country-years with more standardized
   curricula overall reading performance is lower and the association
   between standardization and reading performance is more negative for
   boys than for girls. In counties with educational systems in which
   students are selected into educational tracks at later ages, gender
   differences in reading are larger because girls benefit more from late
   selection. These results indicate that educational policies at the
   country level are related not only to the reading performance of all
   students, but also to the underperformance of boys in reading.

AB Using correspondence testing, we investigate if employers discriminate

   curriculum vitae (CVs) except for their sex and their qualifications
   (meeting standards or higher). In the second pair, candidates differed
   by sex and parenthood status (with or without children). We interpret
   the observed differences in favour of men as signalling gender bias in
   recruitment. This bias is reduced when women have higher qualifications
   and increases when they have children. We interpret employers' openness
   to modify their decisions when candidates' personal characteristics
   differ from the group norm, and the absence of discrimination among
   highly qualified non-mothers, as evidence that gender bias in
   recruitment is largely grounded in employers' stereotypes rather than in

AB Women in developed countries still bear the brunt of care and household
   work, often with severe consequences for their professional careers. In
   addition to policies to promote gender equality in the realm of
   household work, state-supported outsourcing has the potential to help
   women reduce work-family conflict in a more optimal way and thus to
   realize their professional potential. We use the enactment of the
   Belgian Service Voucher Scheme to examine whether the introduction of a
   heavily state-subsidized outsourcing option increased women's employment
   rates at the extensive margins, especially among the highly educated.
   Using time-series analyses as well as difference-in-differences models,
   we find both short- and long-term positive changes in the employment
   rates of highly skilled women in Belgium after the enactment of the
   scheme in January 2004. Moreover, the results of our
   difference-in-differences models suggest that highly skilled women's
   increased ability to outsource housework is the main mechanism driving
   the change in their employment rates.

AB This study examines contextual effects on support for the Partij voor de

   the two most frequently researched contextual effects, that of the local

   investigates the effect of the local normative context, through which
   people are hypothesised to be influenced by their neighbours' political
   views. Analysing survey data from The Netherlands Longitudinal
   Lifecourse Study using multilevel logistic regression, no effects are
   found for the local ethnic composition and local economic conditions
   after controlling for individual characteristics. In addition, PVV
   support is much lower in districts with higher shares of highly educated
   residents, which is in line with theories on consensual neighbourhood
   effects. This effect is found to be non-linear and only turns negative
   when around 25 per cent of the population of a district is highly
   educated. Additional analyses show that contact with neighbours, which
   is often assumed to explain this effect, is not a prerequisite for the
   effect to occur.

AB Between 2010 and 2015, migration to Germany increased from very low
   rates to a post-war record high. A heated debate revolves around the
   question whether high immigration increases inter-ethnic tensions or
   whether greater opportunities for inter-ethnic contact reduce prejudice.
   Most previous research has been cross-sectional and restricted to highly
   aggregated contextual data, leading to incomparable results and a highly
   fragmented state of research.
   In this article, we propose a theoretical synthesis of threat and
   contact approaches for three distinct geographical levels. We combine
   longitudinal survey data on young adults in Germany between 2010 and
   2015 with detailed statistics on minority groups' population size in
   neighbourhoods and regions as well as monthly inflows of new migrants.
   We find that attitudes towards minorities improved over time until the
   peak in immigration during 2015 that caused views on migrant groups to
   deteriorate. The positive effect of being friends with minority members
   is offset by threat effects in neighbourhoods with a strong
   concentration of migrants. On the level of cities/counties, by contrast,
   the positive contact effect is dominant.

AB Mixed-effects multilevel models are often used to investigate
   cross-level interactions, a specific type of context effect that may be
   understood as an upper-level variable moderating the association between
   a lower-level predictor and the outcome. We argue that multilevel models
   involving cross-level interactions should always include random slopes
   on the lower-level components of those interactions. Failure to do so
   will usually result in severely anti-conservative statistical inference.
   We illustrate the problem with extensive Monte Carlo simulations and
   examine its practical relevance by studying 30 prototypical cross-level
   interactions with European Social Survey data for 28 countries. In these
   empirical applications, introducing a random slope term reduces the
   absolute t-ratio of the cross-level interaction term by 31 per cent or
   more in three quarters of cases, with an average reduction of 42 per
   cent. Many practitioners seem to be unaware of these issues. Roughly
   half of the cross-level interaction estimates published in the European
   Sociological Review between 2011 and 2016 are based on models that omit
   the crucial random slope term. Detailed analysis of the associated test
   statistics suggests that many of the estimates would not reach
   conventional thresholds for statistical significance in correctly
   specified models that include the random slope. This raises the question
   how much robust evidence of cross-level interactions sociology has
   actually produced over the past decades.

AB This paper studies alcohol consumption among low-income workers in
   India. In a 3-week field experiment, the majority of 229 cycle-rickshaw
   drivers were willing to forgo substantial monetary payments in order to
   set incentives for themselves to remain sober, thus exhibiting demand
   for commitment to sobriety. Randomly receiving sobriety incentives
   significantly reduced daytime drinking while leaving overall drinking
   unchanged. I find no evidence of higher daytime sobriety significantly
   changing labor supply, productivity, or earnings. In contrast,
   increasing sobriety raised savings by 50 percent, an effect that does
   not appear to be solely explained by changes in income net of alcohol
   expenditures. (JEL C93, D14,I12, J22, J24, J31, O12)

AB Making a transfer in kind reduces its value to recipients but can
   improve targeting. We develop an approach to quantiffing this trade-off
   and apply it to home care. Using randomized experiments by Medicaid, we
   find that in-kind provision significantly reduces the value of the
   transfer to recipients while targeting a small fraction of the eligible
   population that is sicker and has fewer informal care-givers than the
   average eligible. Under a wide range of assumptions within a standard
   model, the targeting benefit exceeds the distortion cost. This
   highlights an important cost of recent reforms toward more flexible
   benefits. (JEL D82, H51, H75, I18, I38)

AB How much are low-income individuals willing to pay for health insurance,
   and what are the implications for insurance markets? Using
   administrative data from Massachusetts' subsidized insurance exchange,
   we exploit discontinuities in the subsidy schedule to estimate
   willingness to pay and costs of insurance among low-income adults. As
   subsidies decline, insurance take-up falls rapidly, dropping about 25
   percent for each $40 increase in monthly enrollee premiums. Marginal
   enrollees tend to be lower-cost, indicating adverse selection into
   insurance. But across the entire distribution we can observe
   (approximately the bottom 70 percent of the willingness to pay
   distribution) enrollees' willingness to pay is always less than half of
   their own expected costs that they impose on the insurer. As a result,
   we estimate that take-up will be highly incomplete even with generous
   subsidies. If enrollee premiums were 25 percent of ins ers' average
   costs, at most half of potential enrollees would buy insurance, even
   premiums subsidized to 10 percent of average costs would still leave at
   least 20 percent uninsured. We briefly consider potential explanations
   for these findings and their normative implications.

   construct firm-level measures of the upstreamness of integrated and
   nonintegrated inputs by combining information on firms' production
   activities in more than 100 countries with input-output tables. Whether
   a firm integrates upstream or downstream suppliers depends crucially on

   search for suppliers. Lower search and outsourcing costs lead firms to
   search more and find better suppliers, which in turn drives down
   marginal costs. We test the theory by exploiting the opening of a
   high-speed train line in Japan, which lowered the cost of passenger
   travel but left shipping costs unchanged. Using an exhaustive data set
   on firms' buyer-seller linkages, we find significant improvements in
   firm performance as well as creation of buyer-seller links, consistent

   historical experiment. During this period, the NYSE stocks were
   dual-listed on the Consolidated Stock Exchange (CSE), which already had
   a clearinghouse. Using identical securities on the CSE as a control, we
   find that the introduction of multilateral net settlement through a
   clearinghouse substantially reduced volatility of NYSE returns caused by
   settlement risk and increased asset values. Our results indicate that a
   clearinghouse can improve market stability and value through a reduction

AB The "friendship paradox" (first noted by Feld in 1991) refers to the
   fact that, on average, people have strictly fewer friends than their
   friends have. I show that this oversampling of more popular people can
   lead people to perceive more engagement than exists in the overall
   population. This feeds back to amplify engagement in behaviors that
   involve complementarities. Also, people with the greatest proclivity for
   a behavior choose to interact the most, leading to further feedback and
   amplification. These results are consistent with studies finding
   overestimation of peer consumption of alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs and
   with resulting high levels of drug and alcohol consumption.

   conclude that spatial frictions substantially reduced the rate of return

   programs, automobiles, and telephones made it easier for discoveries to

   The same cleric requests contributions for a hospital from day laborers
   when dressed as a civilian and as a cleric. In Civilian condition, 50
   per cent contributed and 17 per cent made large contributions; in Cleric
   condition, 83 per cent contributed but average giving did not increase
   as most gave the smallest possible amount. Inclusion of a recitation of
   Qur'anic verses in the Cleric condition maintains the 82 per cent
   contribution rate while increasing large contributions to 30 per cent,
   doubling average contributions. Formal education and subjective
   perception of poverty appear to drive the opposing effects of cleric and
   scripture. These results suggest that the power to activate spiritual
   channels lies in the scripture, not with the human wielding religious
   authority, who instead appears to induce minimal compliance with Islamic

AB Election-oriented elites are expected to emphasize issues on which their

   those theories to the content of executive and legislative agendas.
   Arguing that executives have incentives to pursue their party's owned
   issues in the legislature, it theorizes three conditions under which
   these incentives are constrained: when governments are responsive to
   issues prioritized by the public, when a party has a stronger electoral
   mandate and under divided government. The theory is tested using
   time-series analyses of policy agendas of US congressional statutes and
   State of the Union addresses (1947-2012) and UK acts of Parliament and
   the Queen's Speech (1950-2010). The results offer support for the
   theory, and are particularly strong for the US State of the Union
   address, providing insights into institutional differences. The
   implications provide reassurance concerning the conditions under which
   governments focus attention only on their partisan issue priorities.

   based on incumbents' ability to signal positions that are ideologically

   elections primarily use information about the ideology of candidates'
   parties to infer the location of challengers, while they instead rely on
   information about the individual candidates' ideologies to place
   incumbents. In higher-profile Senate elections, the difference between
   challengers and incumbents is trivial. Decomposing the incumbency
   advantage into valence and signaling components, the study finds that
   the signaling mechanism explains 14 per cent of the incumbency advantage
   in House elections, but only 5 per cent of the advantage in Senate
   contests. It also finds that a 50 per cent increase in party
   polarization increases the incumbency advantage by 3 percentage points.

AB What motivates politicians to engage in legislative activities? In
   multilevel systems politicians may be incentivized by ambitions to
   advance their careers either at the state or federal level. This article
   argues that the design of the electoral institutions influences how
   politicians respond to these incentives. Analyzing a unique dataset of
   both 'stated' and 'realized' career ambitions of Members of the European
   Parliament (MEPs), it finds that those who seek to move from the
   European to the national (state) level participate less in legislative
   activities than those who plan to stay at the European (federal) level.
   For MEPs who aim to move to the state level, attendance and
   participation in legislative activities is substantively lower among
   legislators from candidate-centered systems. Importantly, the effect of
   career ambitions on legislative participation is stronger in
   candidate-centered systems than in party-centered systems. These
   findings suggest that the responsiveness associated with
   candidate-centered systems comes at the expense of legislative activity.

   reanalysis of key instances of priming in the literature shows that
   priming of views on policy questions, or 'issues', is very rare. This
   article revisits issue priming during elections by incorporating
   individuals who are largely excluded from Lenz's analyses: respondents
   who, in one or more waves of the panel surveys analyzed, did not report
   a major-party vote (or vote intention) when interviewed. Based on data
   collected during six national elections, the article finds clear
   evidence of issue priming. The findings have implications for the study

   elect half of their congressional delegation every two years, and thus
   districts with an odd number of representatives have varying magnitudes
   in different election years. Furthermore, whether a province elects more
   representatives in midterm or concurrent years was decided by lottery in
   1983. I find that district magnitude (a) increases electoral support for
   small parties, (b) increases the (effective) number of parties that gain
   seats and (c) reduces electoral disproportionality. The last two results
   are driven by the mechanical rather than the psychological effect of
   electoral rules.

AB To authoritarian rulers, holding somewhat competitive elections enhances
   legitimacy, but entails political risks. Committing electoral fraud can
   secure victory, but may jeopardize regime legitimacy. However, there is
   a tool of electoral manipulation that allows authoritarian rulers to
   reduce electoral risk while preserving legitimacy: gerrymandering. This
   article undertakes a systematic study of gerrymandering in Hong Kong,
   using a dataset that documents boundary changes at the level of
   residential buildings. The empirical findings show a significant
   partisan bias in electoral redistricting: opposition constituencies are
   more likely to be redistricted. Redistricting, however, fails to deter
   opposition incumbents from seeking re-election. No significant negative
   relationship is found between redistricting and opposition incumbents'
   vote share, although redistricting does reduce their overall chances of
   re-election. The results suggest that gerrymandering, which involves the
   use of packing and cracking strategies in different districts, can be
   employed to undermine the aggregate electoral performance of the
   opposition parties.

AB What kind of content do citizens in a developing and authoritarian
   country like to acquire from Western free media? What are the effects of
   their potentially selective exposure? In a survey experiment involving
   1,200 Chinese internet users from diverse socio-demographic backgrounds,
   this study finds that Chinese citizens with higher pro-Western
   orientations and lower regime evaluations are more inclined to read
   content that is positive about foreign countries or negative about
   China. More importantly, reading relatively positive foreign media
   content about foreign countries can improve rather than worsen the
   domestic evaluations of citizens who self-select such content. The
   article argues that this is because reputable Western media outlets'
   reports are generally more realistic than overly rosy information about
   foreign socio-economic conditions that popularly circulates in China.
   Consequently, foreign media may have a corrective function and enhance
   regime stability in an authoritarian country by making regime critics
   less critical. The article also introduces a new variant of the patient
   preference trial design that integrates self-selection and random
   assignment of treatments in a way that is useful for studying
   information effects.

   it finds that NGOs are more likely to adopt protest tactics when
   adjacent organizations - those with whom they have direct ties - have
   already done so. The choices of equivalent organizations - those that
   occupy similar relational roles in the network - do not appear to be
   influential. Qualitative evidence also shows that NGOs are affected by
   relational pressure from their peers, which alters their perception of

AB This article presents results from survey experiments investigating
   conditions under which Britons are willing to pay taxes on polluting
   activities. People are no more willing if revenues are hypothecated for
   spending on environmental protection, while making such taxes more
   relevant to people - by naming petrol and electricity as products to
   which they will apply - has a modestly negative effect. Public
   willingness increases sharply if people are told that new environmental
   taxes would be offset by cuts to other taxes, but political distrust
   appears to undermine much of this effect. Previous studies have argued
   that political trust shapes public opinion with respect to environmental
   and many other policies. But this article provides the first
   experimental evidence suggesting that the relationship is causal, at
   least for one specific facet: cynicism about public officials' honesty
   and integrity. The results suggest a need to make confidence in the
   trustworthiness of public officials and their promises more central to

   explores acts of refusal that obstruct attempts to impose austerity
   measures on advanced industrial democracies. It thereby complements a
   literature that has thus far focused far more upon the (apparently
   unobstructed) imposition of austerity. In doing so, it uses two
   typically 'low-resistance' countries - Japan and the UK -as least-likely
   cases and finds that austerity is rarely uncontested. Using fuzzy set
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis, it highlights the 'causal recipes'
   sufficient for both (1) anti-austerity activity to have a significant
   impact on austerity proposals and (2) the smooth (unobstructed)
   imposition of austerity. The politics of austerity is shown to be better
   understood as an iterative interaction between proposals for austerity
   and the acts of refusal they encounter. These obstacles to austerity
   appear more straightforward to activate effectively in Japan's
   coordinated model of capitalism, whilst the UK's liberal market economy
   tends to generate more innovative forms of dissent that (if they are
   sufficiently militant) provide an alternative route towards the
   obstruction of austerity.

   by looking at early attempts at state building: it investigates the

   argument); evaluate practices and institutions against a given set of

AB Recent research on parliamentary institutions has demonstrated that
   legislatures featuring strong committees play an important role in

   lead these committees - committee chairs - is poorly understood. This
   study provides the first examination of whether the partisan control of
   committee chairs in parliamentary systems has a systematic impact on
   legislative scrutiny. The article argues that committee chairs can, in
   principle, use their significant agenda powers to serve two purposes:
   providing opposition parties with a greater ability to scrutinize
   government policy proposals, and enabling government parties to better
   police one another. Analyzing the legislative histories of 1,100
   government bills in three parliamentary democracies, the study finds
   that control of committee chairs significantly strengthens the ability
   of opposition parties to engage in legislative review. The analysis also
   suggests that government parties' ability to monitor their coalition
   allies does not depend on control of committee chairs.

AB Complex models are of increasing interest to social scientists.
   Researchers interested in prediction generally favor flexible, robust
   approaches, while those interested in causation are often interested in
   modeling nuanced treatment structures and confounding relationships.
   Unfortunately, estimators of complex models often scale poorly,
   especially if they seek to maintain interpretability. In this paper, we
   present an example of such a conundrum and show how optimization can
   alleviate the worst of these concerns. Specifically, we introduce
   bigKRLS, which offers a variety of statistical and computational
   improvements to the Hainmueller and Hazlett (2013) Kernel-Regularized
   Least Squares (KRLS) approach. As part of our improvements, we decrease
   the estimator's single-core runtime by 50% and reduce the estimator's
   peak memory usage by an order of magnitude. We also improve uncertainty
   estimates for the model's average marginal effect estimates which we
   test both in simulation and in practice and introduce new visual and
   statistical tools designed to assist with inference under the model. We
   further demonstrate the value of our improvements through an analysis of
   the 2016 presidential election, an analysis that would have been
   impractical or even infeasible for many users with existing software.

   biased portrait of the distribution of critical political attitudes and
   behavior. We show that this bias occurs in the context of both typical
   closed ended questions and in list experiments. Inattentive respondents
   are common and are more prevalent among the young and less educated.
   Those who do not pass the trap questions interact with the survey
   instrument in distinctive ways: they take less time to respond; are more
   likely to report nonattitudes; and display lower consistency in their

AB Multiplicative interaction models are widely used in social science to
   examine whether the relationship between an outcome and an independent
   variable changes with a moderating variable. Current empirical practice
   tends to overlook two important problems. First, these models assume a
   linear interaction effect that changes at a constant rate with the
   moderator. Second, estimates of the conditional effects of the
   independent variable can be misleading if there is a lack of common
   support of the moderator. Replicating 46 interaction effects from 22
   recent publications in five top political science journals, we find that
   these core assumptions often fail in practice, suggesting that a large
   portion of findings across all political science subfields based on
   interaction models are fragile and model dependent. We propose a
   checklist of simple diagnostics to assess the validity of these
   assumptions and offer flexible estimation strategies that allow for
   nonlinear interaction effects and safeguard against excessive

   the causes of this persistent bias are poorly understood. The
   face-to-face component of the 2012 ANES produced a turnout estimate at
   least 13 points higher than the benchmark voting-eligible population
   turnout rate. We consider three explanations for this overestimate in
   the survey: nonresponse bias, over-reporting and the possibility that
   the ANES constitutes an inadvertent mobilization treatment. Analysis of
   turnout data supplied by voter file vendors allows the three phenomena
   to be measured for the first time in a single survey. We find that
   over-reporting is the largest contributor, responsible for six
   percentage points of the turnout overestimate, while nonresponse bias

   flexible enough to be applied to a variety of contexts. We contrast the
   AME model to two prominent approaches in the literature: the latent

   Relative to these approaches, we show that the AME approach is (a) to be
   easy to implement; (b) interpretable in a general linear model
   framework; (c) computationally straightforward; (d) not prone to
   degeneracy; (e) captures first-, second-, and third-order network

AB There is an ongoing debate about whether human rights standards have

   relies upon indicators created by human coders reading the texts of
   human rights reports. To help resolve this debate, we suggest
   translating the question of changing standards into a supervised
   learning problem. From this perspective, the application of consistent
   standards over time implies a time-constant mapping from the textual
   features in reports to the human coded scores. Alternatively, if the
   meaning of abuses have evolved over time, then the same textual features
   will be labeled with different numerical scores at distinct times. Of
   course, while the mapping from natural language to numerical human
   rights score is a highly complicated function, we show that these two
   distinct data generation processes imply divergent overall patterns of
   accuracy when we train a wide variety of algorithms on older versus

AB Does exposure to the refugee crisis fuel support for extreme-right
   parties? Despite heated debates about the political repercussions of the
   refugee crisis in Europe, there exists very little and sometimes
   conflicting evidence with which to assess the impact of a large influx
   of refugees on natives' political attitudes and behavior. We provide
   causal evidence from a natural experiment in Greece, where some Aegean
   islands close to the Turkish border experienced sudden and drastic
   increases in the number of Syrian refugees while other islands slightly
   farther away but with otherwise similar institutional and socioeconomic
   characteristics did not. Placebo tests suggest that precrisis trends in
   vote shares for exposed and nonexposed islands were virtually identical.
   This allows us to obtain unbiased estimates of the electoral
   consequences of the refugee crisis. Our study shows that among islands
   that faced a massive but transient inflow of refugees passing through
   just before the September 2015 election, vote shares for Golden Dawn,
   the most extreme-right party in Europe, moderately increased by 2
   percentage points (a 44 percent increase at the average). The finding
   that mere exposure to the refugee crisis is sufficient to fuel support

AB We offer a dynamic Bayesian forecasting model for multiparty elections.
   It combines data from published pre-election public opinion polls with
   information from fundamentals-based forecasting models. The model takes
   care of the multiparty nature of the setting and allows making
   statements about the probability of other quantities of interest, such
   as the probability of a plurality of votes fora party or the majority
   for certain coalitions in parliament. We present results from two ex
   ante forecasts of elections that took place in 2017 and are able to show
   that the model outperforms fundamentals-based forecasting models in
   terms of accuracy and the calibration of uncertainty. Provided that
   historical and current polling data are available, the model can be
   applied to any multiparty setting.

AB Punitive and disciplinary forms of governance disproportionately target
   low-income Black Americans for surveillance and punishment, and research
   finds far-reaching consequences of such criminalization. Drawing on
   in-depth interviews with 46 low-income Black mothers of adolescents in
   urban neighborhoods, this article advances understanding of the long
   reach of criminalization by examining the intersection of two related
   areas of inquiry: the criminalization of Black youth and the
   institutional scrutiny and punitive treatment of Black mothers. Findings
   demonstrate that poor Black mothers calibrate their parenting strategies
   not only to fears that their children will be criminalized by mainstream
   institutions and the police, but also to concerns that they themselves
   will be criminalized as bad mothers who could lose their parenting
   rights. We develop the concept of "family criminalization" to explain
   the intertwining of Black mothers' and children's vulnerability to
   institutional surveillance and punishment. We argue that to fully grasp
   the causes and consequences of mass incarceration and its
   disproportionate impact on Black youth and adults, sociologists must be
   attuned to family dynamics and linkages as important to how
   criminalization unfolds in the lives of Black Americans.

AB An increasing number of minority youth experience contact with the
   criminal justice system. But how does the expansion of police presence
   in poor urban communities affect educational outcomes? Previous research
   points at multiple mechanisms with opposing effects. This article
   presents the first causal evidence of the impact of aggressive policing
   on minority youths' educational performance. Under Operation Impact, the
   New York Police Department (NYPD) saturated high-crime areas with
   additional police officers with the mission to engage in aggressive,
   order-maintenance policing. To estimate the effect of this policing
   program, we use administrative data from more than 250,000 adolescents
   age 9 to 15 and a difference-in-differences approach based on variation
   in the timing of police surges across neighborhoods. We find that
   exposure to police surges significantly reduced test scores for African
   American boys, consistent with their greater exposure to policing. The
   size of the effect increases with age, but there is no discernible
   effect for African American girls and Hispanic students. Aggressive
   policing can thus lower educational performance for some minority
   groups. These findings provide evidence that the consequences of
   policing extend into key domains of social life, with implications for
   the educational trajectories of minority youth and social inequality
   more broadly.

AB Quantitative performance ratings are ubiquitous in modern
   organizations-from businesses to universities-yet there is substantial
   evidence of bias against women in such ratings. This study examines how
   gender inequalities in evaluations depend on the design of the tools
   used to judge merit. Exploiting a quasi-natural experiment at a large
   North American university, we found that the number of scale points used
   in faculty teaching evaluations-whether instructors were rated on a
   scale of 6 versus a scale of 10-significantly affected the size of the
   gender gap in evaluations in the most male-dominated fields. A survey
   experiment, which presented all participants with an identical lecture
   transcript but randomly varied instructor gender and the number of scale
   points, replicated this finding and suggested that the number of scale
   points affects the extent to which gender stereotypes of brilliance are
   expressed in quantitative ratings. These results highlight how seemingly
   minor technical aspects of performance ratings can have a major effect
   on the evaluation of men and women. Our findings thus contribute to a
   growing body of work on organizational practices that reduce workplace
   inequalities and the sociological literature on how rating
   systems-rather than being neutral instruments-shape the distribution of
   rewards in organizations.

AB A recurring question in public and scientific debates is whether
   occupation-specific skills enhance labor market outcomes. Is it
   beneficial to have an educational degree that is linked to only one or a
   small set of occupations? To answer this question, we generalize
   existing models of the effects of (mis)match between education and
   occupation on labor market outcomes. Specifically, we incorporate the
   structural effects of linkage strength between school and work, which
   vary considerably across industrialized countries. In an analysis of
   France, Germany, and the United States, we find that workers have higher
   earnings when they are in occupations that match their educational level
   and field of study, but the size of this earnings boost depends on the
   clarity and strength of the pathway between their educational credential
   and the labor market. The earnings premium associated with a good
   occupational match is larger in countries where the credential has a
   stronger link to the labor market, but the penalty for a mismatch is
   also greater in such countries. Moreover, strong linkage reduces
   unemployment risk. These findings add nuance to often-made arguments
   that countries with loosely structured educational systems have more
   flexible labor markets and produce better labor market outcomes for
   workers. An institutional environment that promotes strong
   school-to-work pathways appears to be an effective strategy for
   providing workers with secure, well-paying jobs.

AB Dual-process models are increasingly popular in sociology as a framework
   for theorizing the role of automatic cognition in shaping social
   behavior. However, empirical studies using dual-process models often
   rely on ad hoc measures such as forced-choice surveys, observation, and
   interviews whose relationships to underlying cognitive processes are not
   fully established. In this article, we advance dual-process research in
   sociology by (1) proposing criteria for measuring automatic cognition,
   and (2) assessing the empirical performance of two popular measures of
   automatic cognition developed by psychologists. We compare the ability
   of the Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT), the Affect Misattribution
   Procedure (AMP), and traditional forced-choice measures to predict
   process-pure estimates of automatic influences on individuals' behavior
   during a survey task. Results from three studies focusing on politics,
   morality, and racial attitudes suggest the AMP provides the most valid
   and consistent measure of automatic cognitive processes. We conclude by
   discussing the implications of our findings for sociological practice.

AB How do proto-state organizations achieve an initial accumulation of
   power, such that they are in a position to grow (or shrink) as an
   organization, maintain their prestige (or lose it), and be viewed, by
   elite and populace, as something real and consequential that can be
   argued about, supported, or attacked? This article argues that
   state-formation has a performative dimension, in which the publicity of
   acts of violence, coercion, and negotiation made by agents of the
   proto-state, and the variable interpretation of these acts, are
   paramount to the state's success (or failure) and developing character.
   In the model developed here, agents of a would-be state act in response
   to emergencies, and when public interpretations of those actions assign
   their character and effectiveness to "the state," the state is performed
   into being. In particular, public performance solves, in part, agency
   problems obtaining between state rulers and their staff and elite
   allies. The formation of the federal government in the early American
   republic (1783 to 1801), whose success is insufficiently accounted for
   by extant theory, provides an opportunity to develop a model of the
   performative dimension of state-formation.

   We estimate the structural model via indirect inference, exploiting a
   discontinuity in the formula for determining the size of grants, which
   helps isolate the causal effect of neighbors' rebuilding on one's own
   rebuilding choices. We find that the additional rebuilding induced by RH
   generated positive externalities equivalent to $4950 to each
   inframarginal household whose rebuilding choice was not affected by the
   program. Counterfactual policy experiments find that optimal subsidy
   policies bias grant offers against relocation, with an inverse-U-shaped

   perspective on how economic growth and globalization affect the patterns

   algebraically equivalent to the instrumental variables (IV) estimator.
   Our leading example is Heckman's (1979) two-step ("Heckit") control
   function estimator which, with two-sided non-compliance, can be used to
   compute estimates of a variety of causal parameters. Equivalence with IV
   is established for a semiparametric family of control function
   estimators and shown to hold at interior solutions for a class of
   maximum likelihood estimators. Our results suggest differences between
   structural and IV estimates often stem from disagreements about the
   target parameter rather than from functional form assumptions per se. In
   cases where equivalence fails, reporting structural estimates of LATE
   alongside IV provides a simple means of assessing the credibility of
   structural extrapolation exercises.

   remain passive in long-term bond markets, making payments and retiring
   long-term bonds as they mature but never actively issuing or buying back
   such bonds. The only active debt-management margin is the short-term

   consequences of this intuition in a noncooperative game. We augment a
   game with a network to represent strategic information: if two players
   are linked in the network, they have correct conjectures about each
   others' strategies. In peer-confirming equilibrium, there is common
   belief that players (i) behave rationally and (ii) correctly anticipate
   neighbors' play. In simultaneous-move games, adding links to the network
   always restricts the set of outcomes. In dynamic games, the outcome set
   may vary non-monotonically with the network because the actions of
   well-connected players help poorly-connected players coordinate. This
   solution concept provides a useful language for studying public good
   provision, highlights a new channel through which central individuals
   facilitate coordination, and delineates possible sources of
   miscoordination in protests and coups.

   prevalence of exclusionary discipline in elementary school, (2) racial
   disparities in exclusionary discipline in elementary school, and (3) the
   association between exclusionary discipline and aggressive behavior in
   elementary school. Using child and parent reports from the Fragile
   Families Study, we estimate that more than one in ten children born
   between 1998 and 2000 in large US cities were suspended or expelled by
   age nine, when most were in third grade. We also find extreme racial
   disparity; about 40 percent of non-Hispanic black boys were suspended or
   expelled, compared to 8 percent of non-Hispanic white or other-race
   boys. Disparities are largely due to differences in childrens school and
   home environments rather than to behavior problems. Next, consistent
   with social stress and strain theories, we find suspension or expulsion
   associated with increased aggressive behavior in elementary school. This
   association does not vary by race but is robust to a rich set of
   covariates, within-individual fixed effects, and matching methods. In
   conjunction with what we find for racial disparities, our results imply
   that school discipline policies relying heavily on exclusionary
   punishment may be fostering childhood inequality.

AB Large multi-product firms dominate international trade flows. Using
   novel linked production and export data at the firm-product level, we
   find that the overwhelming majority of manufacturing firms export
   products that they do not produce. Three quarters of the exported
   products and 30% of export value from Belgian manufacturers are in goods
   that are not produced by the firm, so-called Carry-Along Trade (CAT).
   The number of CAT products is strongly increasing in firm productivity
   while the number of produced products that are exported is weakly
   increasing in firm productivity. We propose a general model of
   production and sourcing at multi-product firms and explore new demand-
   and supply-side modelling features capable of generating predictions
   consistent with the empirical findings. Export price data and company
   interviews offer suggestive evidence for the presence of demand-scope
   complementarities.

AB A multiple causes perspective contends that economic development and
   poor health contributed to early 20th-century southern race-related
   differences in fertility. The authors link the 1910 IPUMS to the 1916
   Plantation Census (1909 data), southern disease (malaria and hookworm),
   and sanitation indicators to examine fertility differentials, while
   accounting for child mortality (an endogenous demographic control). They
   find that African-American and white women in counties with higher
   malaria mortality had higher child mortality. Additionally,
   African-American women exposed to poorer sanitation and plantation
   development had higher child mortality. Consistent with a multiple
   causes perspective, white women's fertility was lower where land
   improvement and school enrollment were higher. African-American women's
   fertility was lower in health-place contexts of higher malaria mortality
   and greater plantation development.

AB Using time-varying, prospectively measured income in a nationally
   representative sample of baby-boomer men (the National Longitudinal
   Survey of Youth, 1979), the authors identify eight group-based
   trajectories of income between ages 25 and 49 and use multinomial
   treatment models to describe the associations between group-based income
   trajectories and mental and physical health at midlife. The authors find
   remarkable rigidity in income trajectories: less than 25% of the sample
   experiences significant upward or downward mobility between ages 25 and
   49, and most who move remain or move into poverty. Men's physical and
   mental health at age 50 is strongly associated with their income
   trajectories, and some upwardly mobile men achieve the same physical and
   mental health as the highest earning men after adjusting for selection.
   The worse physical and mental health of men on other income trajectories
   is largely attributable to their early life disadvantages, health
   behaviors, and cumulative work experiences.

AB Women have become increasingly economically self-reliant, depending more
   on paid employment for their positions in the income distribution than
   in the past. We know little about what happened to men, however, because
   most prior research restricts changes in self-reliance to be "zero-sum,"
   with women's changes necessitating opposite and proportionate changes
   among men. This article introduces a measure that allows asymmetric
   changes and also incorporates multiple population subgroups and income
   sources beyond couples' labor earnings. Using Current Population Survey
   data, the authors find that women's self-reliance increased
   dramatically, as expected, but men's declined only slightly. The authors
   decompose these trends into changes in family structure and
   redistribution, which increased and decreased self-reliance,
   respectively, for men and women, though more for women. Labor market
   shifts, by contrast, were asymmetric and opposing, reducing men's
   self-reliance much less than they increased women's. The authors'
   approach opens opportunities for new insight into both gender inequality
   and the income attainment process.

AB Social influence may lead individuals to choose what is popular over
   what is best. Whenever this happens, it further increases the popularity
   advantage of the inferior choice, compelling subsequent decision makers
   to follow suit. The author argues that despite this positive feedback
   effect, discordances between popularity and quality will usually
   self-correct. Reanalyzing past experimental studies in which social
   information initially heavily favored inferior options, the author shows
   that in each experiment superior alternatives gained in popularity. This
   article also reports on a new experiment in which a larger number of
   subject choices allowed trials to be run to convergence and shows that
   in each trial the superior alternative eventually achieved popular
   dominance. To explain the persistent dominance of bestsellers,
   celebrities, and memes of seemingly questionable quality in everyday
   life in terms of social influence processes, one must identify
   conditions that render positive feedback so strong that self-correcting
   dynamics are prevented.

AB A large literature examines the global diffusion of institutions and
   policies, yet there is much less systematic research on how cultural
   tastes, consumption preferences, and other individual interests spread
   across the globe. With a data set that tracks the most popular Google
   search terms in 199 countries between 2004 and 2014, and drawing on
   Gabriel de Tarde, this article introduces a theoretical framework to
   examine how country-level differences shape global imitation of cultural
   interests and consumer tastes. Contrary to popular accounts, this study
   finds that cross-national diffusion is surprisingly rare-and seldom U.S.
   led-but occurs through a multichannel network with many different
   centers. Negative binomial regression models applied to cases of
   diffusion in 346,620 country-year dyads reveal that global imitation
   flows are likely patterned by the power and prestige of countries, their
   proximities to each other, and the cultural boundaries between them.
   Accounting for factors such as the influence of large organizations does
   not disrupt these findings.

AB How do periods of conflict and peace shape women's empowerment around
   the world? While existing studies have demonstrated that gender
   inequalities contribute to the propensity for armed conflict, we
   consider how the anticipation and realization of armed conflict shape
   women's opportunities for influence in society. Some scholars have
   pointed to the role that militarization and threat play in entrenching
   male dominance, while others have argued that periods of warfare can
   upend existing gender hierarchical orders. We posit mechanisms by which
   the preparation for and experiences during war affect change in women's
   empowerment. We develop and test observable implications using
   cross-national data from 1900 to 2015. We find that, at least in the
   short and medium term, warfare can disrupt social institutions and lead
   to an increase in women's empowerment via mechanisms related to role
   shifts across society and political shifts catalyzed by war. Reforming
   institutions and mainstreaming gender during peace processes stand to
   have important legacies for gender power relations in postconflict
   societies, though much more may be needed for more permanent change.

AB When and where do states coercively alter their internal demography? We
   build a theory that predicts under what conditions states alter the
   demographic "facts on the ground" by resettling and expelling
   ethno-national populations. We predict that, under particular scope
   conditions, states will employ demographic engineering to shore up
   control over (1) nonnatural frontiers, and (2) areas populated by ethnic
   minorities who are co-ethnics with elites in a hostile power. We then
   substantiate our predictions using new subnational data from both China
   and the USSR. Causally identifying the spatially differential effect of
   international conflict on demographic engineering via a
   difference-in-differences design, we find that the Sino-Soviet split
   (1959-1982) led to a disproportionate increase in the expulsion of
   ethnic Russians and resettlement of ethnic Han in Chinese border areas
   lacking a natural border with the USSR, and that resettlement was
   targeted at areas populated by ethnic Russians. On the Soviet side, we
   similarly find that the Sino-Soviet split led to a significant increase
   in expulsion of Chinese and the resettlement of Russians in border
   areas, and that resettlement was targeted at areas populated by more
   Chinese. We develop the nascent field of political demography by
   advancing our theoretical and empirical understanding of when, where,
   and to whom states seek to effect demographic change. By demonstrating
   that both ethnic group concentration and dispersion across borders are
   endogenous to international conflict, our results complicate a large and
   influential literature linking ethnic demography to conflict.

AB This article studies the conditions that lead peripheral minorities to
   identify with the state, their ethnic group, or neighboring countries.
   We contribute to research on separatism and irredentism by examining how
   violence, psychological distance, and national status determine
   identification. The analysis uses data from a novel experiment that
   randomized videos of actual violence in a large, representative survey
   of the Kashmir Valley region in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir,
   an enduring site of separatist and irredentist conflict. We find that a
   strong regional identity is a counterweight to irredentism, but violent
   repression by the state can push members of the minority to identify
   with an irredentist neighbor. Violence increases perceived distance from
   the nation and reduces national identification. There is suggestive
   evidence that these effects are concentrated among individuals with
   attributes that otherwise predict higher levels of identification with
   the state. Information about integrative institutions and increased
   national status brought about by economic growth is insufficient to
   induce national identification in a context where psychological distance
   from the nation is large.

AB What are the effects of international intervention on the rule of law
   after civil war? Rule of law requires not only that state authorities
   abide by legal limits on their power, but also that citizens rely on
   state laws and institutions to adjudicate disputes. Using an original
   survey and list experiment in Liberia, I show that exposure to the UN
   Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) increased citizens' reliance on state over
   nonstate authorities to resolve the most serious incidents of crime and
   violence, and increased nonstate authorities' reliance on legal over
   illegal mechanisms of dispute resolution. I use multiple identification
   strategies to support a causal interpretation of these results,
   including an instrumental variables strategy that leverages plausibly
   exogenous variation in the distribution of UNMIL personnel induced by
   the killing of seven peacekeepers in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire. My
   results are still detectable two years later, even in communities that
   report no further exposure to peacekeepers. I also find that exposure to
   UNMIL did not mitigate and may in fact have exacerbated citizens'
   perceptions of state corruption and bias in the short term, but that
   these apparently adverse effects dissipated over time. I conclude by
   discussing implications of these complex but overall beneficial effects.

AB While extensive research shows that policies and institutions spread
   across states through processes of diffusion, we know little about
   diffusion among international organizations (IOs). We develop a novel
   approach for the study of diffusion among IOs. This approach consists of
   three components: a theoretical focus on connectivity among IOs as
   pathways for diffusion; a conceptual differentiation between alternative
   types of convergence effects; and a methodological strategy combining
   dyadic and spatial analysis of diffusion. We illustrate the usefulness
   of this approach through an empirical case: the diffusion of
   participatory governance arrangements among IOs from 1970 to 2010. The
   analysis shows that connectivity among IOs contributes to convergence,
   which typically is manifested through imitation of very specific
   institutional models. The article's findings have implications both for
   the study of IOs and for the general study of diffusion.

AB The United States' 1890-91 decision to begin building a battleship
   fleet, an important point in its development as a world power, can
   illuminate the domestic sources of foreign policy ambition. An analysis
   of roll-call votes in the House of Representatives indicates that
   socioeconomic divisions arising from industrialization strongly
   influenced support and opposition to the battleship fleet. This
   relationship worked mainly through trade policy interests: members of
   Congress from import-competing states tended to support the effort,
   while those from export-oriented states tended to oppose it. The
   patriotic symbolism of battleships at a time of labor unrest also helped
   motivate support for the program, though evidence of this pattern is
   less conclusive. Although party affiliation was crucial, it was also
   partly a function of economic structure, which shaped the two parties'
   electoral fortunes. The impact of trade interests during this period is
   a mirror image of what previous research has found concerning the
   post-World War II era, when export-oriented interests tended to support
   American global activism and import-competing interests to oppose it.
   The reason for the difference is the Republican Party's commitment to
   trade protection, which strongly influenced both the goals of the policy
   and the identity of its supporters.

AB Gender stereotypes-stylized expectations of individuals' traits and
   capabilities based on their gender-may affect the behavior of diplomats
   and the processes of international negotiations. In a survey experiment
   in the Council of the European Union, we find that female
   representatives behaving stereotypically weak and vulnerable may trigger
   a chivalry reaction among male representatives, increasing the
   likelihood that the men will agree to support a bargaining proposal from
   the women. The effect is conditional on the negotiators' cultural
   background-the chivalry reaction is displayed mainly by diplomats from
   countries with relatively low levels of gender equality. Our study
   contributes to the research on nonstandard behavior in international
   relations, and in particular the expression and reception of emotions in
   diplomacy. We argue that gender stereotypes may have a moderating impact
   on decision making based on such intuitive cognitive processes. We also
   add to the broader negotiation literature, both by showing the
   pervasiveness of gender stereotyping, and by testing at the elite level
   the generalizability of claims regarding gender effects derived from
   laboratory experiments. Overall, our findings demonstrate the importance
   of bringing gender into the study of international negotiations, where
   it has been largely and surprisingly ignored.

   the analysis within contemporary scholarship on deservingness and on

   that rely upon affect-driven economies of exchange underpinned by moral
   judgements of deservingness, value and worth. In particular, this paper
   draws on a multi-city (Melbourne, London, San Francisco) study of
   homeless street press sellers (The Big Issue and Street Sheet) to
   explore the ways in which contemporary practices of charity and care are
   carried out through individualized market-place exchanges. Sellers'
   accounts of their work reveal how smiling and being (or looking) happy
   is a performative expectation that must be managed in the face of
   poverty and precarity.

AB Reflexivity is an important sociological lens through which to examine
   the means by which people engage in actions that contribute to social
   reproduction or social elaboration. Reflexivity theorists have largely
   overlooked the central place of emotions in reflexive processing,
   however, thus missing opportunities to enhance our understanding of
   reflexivity by capitalizing on recent scholarship on emotions emanating
   from other fields of inquiry. This paper explores the role of emotion in
   reflexivity, with a qualitative analysis of social responses to
   hydraulic fracturing in Alberta, Canada, utilizing narrative analysis of
   long-form interviews with rural landowners who have experienced direct
   impacts from hydraulic fracturing, and have attempted to voice their
   concerns in the public sphere. Based on interviews with a selection of
   two interview participants, the paper highlights the means by which
   emotions shape reflexivity in consequential ways, beginning with
   personal and highly individualized emotional responses to contingent
   situations, which then factor into the social interactions engaged in
   the pursuit of personal projects. The shared emotional context that
   emerges then plays a substantial role in shaping outcomes and their
   implications for social stasis or change. This study exemplifies the
   extent to which reflexive processing in response to breaches in the
   social order can be emotionally tumultuous affairs, constituting a
   significant personal toll that many may be unwilling to pay.

AB The European 'refugee crisis' has generated a broad movement of
   volunteers offering their time and skills to support refugees across the
   continent, in the absence of nation states. This article focuses on
   volunteers who helped in the informal refugee camp in Calais called the
   'Jungle'. It looks at the importance of emotions as a motivating factor
   for taking on responsibilities that are usually carried out by
   humanitarian aid organizations. We argue that empathy is not only the
   initial motivator for action, but it also sustains the voluntary
   activity as volunteers make sense of their emotions through working in
   the camp. This type of volunteering has also created new spaces for
   sociability and community, as volunteers have formed strong emotional
   and relational bonds with each other and with the refugees. Finally,
   this article contributes to the growing body of literature that aims at
   repositioning emotions within the social sciences research to argue that
   they are an important analytical tool to understand social life and

   tendency is most pronounced among children of professional, educated

   shows that students who do not choose the same field as their parents
   nonetheless tend to choose educational fields close to those of their
   parents.

AB Childhood disability has been largely overlooked in social
   stratification and life course research. As a result, we know remarkably
   little about mechanisms behind well-documented disability differentials
   in educational outcomes. This study investigates educational transitions
   of disabled youth using data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People
   in England. We draw on social stratification literature on primary and
   secondary effects as well as that on stigma and labelling in order to
   explain disabled young people's educational outcomes. We find that
   disability differentials in transition rates to full-time academic upper
   secondary education and to university are largely the result of primary
   effects, reflected in differences in school performance between disabled
   and non-disabled young people. However, we also find evidence for
   secondary effects, with similarly achieving disabled young people less
   likely to pursue full-time academic upper secondary education compared
   to their non-disabled peers. We examine the extent to which these
   effects can be explained by disabled youth's suppressed educational
   expectations as well as their experiences of being bullied at school,
   which we link to the stigma experienced by disabled young people and
   their families. We find that educational expectations play an important
   role at crucial transitions in the English school system, while the
   effect of bullying is considerably smaller. By drawing attention to
   different social processes contributing to disability differentials in
   attainment, our study moves beyond medical models that implicitly assume
   a naturalized association of disability with poor educational outcomes,
   and demonstrates the parallels of disability with other ascriptive
   inequalities.

AB A new stream of sociological and demographic theory emphasizes
   individualization as the key process in late modernity. As maintained by
   Hakim (), women also have increasingly become agents of their own
   biographies, less influenced by the social class and the family. In this
   study, I intend to contribute to this debate by analysing how, in Italy
   and Britain, women's movements between employment and housework are
   linked to their husband's education and class, and how this link has
   changed across cohorts. Using discrete-time event-history modelling on
   the BHPS and ILFI, my findings show that in both countries, if the
   woman's educational and labour-market profile is controlled for, the
   husband's occupation and education have lost importance. Yet, although
   based more on 'her' than 'his' profile, divisions along 'classic' lines
   are still evident and not context-free, and they assume different forms
   in the two countries with distinctive institutional and cultural
   settings. In 'liberal' Britain, women's labour-market participation
   responds more to motherhood and class than to education, while in
   'familistic' Italy education seems more important, which suggests the
   existence of returns over and above strictly human capital/economic
   ones.

AB Research on privilege and education often focuses on institutions that
   are elite in a rather traditional way, for example schools that instruct
   the children of the upper classes according to a reproductive logic that
   reinforces existing inequalities. The present article addresses the
   fostering of advantage from the angle of a more ambiguous case. The
   Global College, a municipal Swedish upper secondary school specialized
   in environmental issues and global justice, offers an empirical prism
   for discussing the cultivation of elite identification through the
   formative potential of an egalitarian ethos. The relation between ethics
   and class is examined, not only in terms of how moral stands are
   classed, but also by investigating into the productive capacities of
   such orientation. Through extensive ethnographic fieldwork, the study
   unfolds how a possible tension between egalitarianism and elitism
   resolves into a productive relation whereby the students' incarnation of
   ethico-political ideals becomes a means for developing agency,
   confidence, entrepreneurial skills and an overall sense of ease.

AB What produces the power of senior civil servants at ministries of
   finance, positioned at the top of the bureaucratic hierarchy? Max Weber
   has claimed that a hierarchical organization, meritocratic recruitment
   and procedural work provide bureaucracies with legitimacy. In particular
   he insisted on the role of Fachwissen (disciplinary knowledge) obtained
   through formal education. However, he also argued for the role of
   Dienstwissen, forms of knowledge and skills stemming from the experience
   of service in itself. Weber did not elaborate on this concept in detail,
   and few analysts of governmental expertise have examined this notion. We
   draw on the practice-turn in sociology, combining the study of
   governmental expertise with micro-sociological studies of administrative
   practices. By analysing interviews with 48 senior civil servants at the
   British, French and Norwegian ministries of finance about their daily
   practices, this article demonstrates that bureaucratic note-writing and
   the procedural evaluation of such notes constitute a key form of
   expertise that yields authority. The study provides an analytical
   framework for understanding what administrative expertise consists of,
   how it is integral to procedural work, the forms bureaucratic
   hierarchies take in practice and how these three dimensions provide
   authority.

   a crucial tension in the nature of artistic labour, and are, at the very
   least, problematic in their function as conduits towards full
   professional identity. They may instead act to maintain the precarious
   working situation of composers in a neoliberal age. The working lives of

AB Deindustrialization is a complex and multifaceted series of processes
   and transitions, reflecting the equally complicated web of social
   relationships and interdependencies that constitute(d) an industrial
   society. Contemporary scholars have looked beyond just the economic
   impact of industrial loss, to the cultural, temporal and spatial
   legacies and impacts wrought by the mass closures of the 1980s, as well
   as the continuing presence of an industrial identity in struggles over
   representation and regeneration. However, deindustrialization has a
   history that precedes the volatility and culmination of that period, and
   has impacted upon a more geographically diverse range of former
   industrial locations than are commonly represented. The narratives that
   surround some sites are complicated by their displacement in time, place
   and discourse; they lack the political capital of an 'industrial'
   identity through this disassociation. In this article I aim to go beyond
   what we might consider the industrial 'heartlands' of the UK to a place
   that has felt the impact of deindustrialization, but which falls outside
   of the usual representations of the UK's industrial past. I explore how
   the industrial identity and memory of a place can be naturalized and
   selectively reworked for the needs of the hour, the very meaning of
   'industrial' altered in the process. I argue that for sites unable to
   access or utilize the imagery of modern, heavy industry for community or
   promotional aims, deindustrialization becomes a process of rewriting an
   historic identity - one that sheds new light on industrial loss in
   diverse situations, and at an ever-increasing distance from closure.

AB Recently there has been renewed interest in the role of religion in the
   public sphere in the context of a 'post-secular' age characterized by
   the resurgence of religious identities and communities in increasingly
   diverse, multi-faith societies. Young people's active political and
   civic engagement has also emerged as a core challenge for robust
   democracies. While an interesting body of current research suggests that
   religious commitment may cultivate participation amongst youth by acting
   as an incubator of civic and political engagement, such literature often
   positions religiosity as outside of, and consequently at odds with
   participation in a secular public sphere. We suggest that while
   religiosity may indeed act as an incubator for civic and political
   engagement, we propose greater attention to an emergence of alternative,
   entwined conceptualizations of religious citizenship evident in the
   practices, performances and dispositions of young Muslim and Buddhist
   religious practitioners in Australia, whereby processes of individuation
   contribute to greater fluidity within and across the domains of the
   religious and the civic.

AB Stratification and inequality are among the most central concepts in
   sociology, and although related, they are fundamentally distinct:
   inequality refers to the extent to which resources are distributed
   unevenly across individuals or between population subgroups, whereas
   stratification refers to the extent to which population subgroups occupy
   distinct hierarchical layers within an overall resource distribution.
   Despite the centrality of stratification in theories of class structure,
   prior empirical studies have focused exclusively on measures of
   inequality, which do not accurately capture the degree of class
   stratification and suffer from a variety of methodological limitations.
   In this paper, we employ a novel rank-based index of stratification to
   measure the degree to which occupational classes inhabit distinct,
   non-overlapping, and hierarchically arranged layers in the distribution
   of personal market income. The stratification index is nonparametric,
   both scale and translation invariant, and independent of the level of
   inequality. Based on this index, our results show that the US income
   distribution is highly stratified by occupational class and that the
   degree of class stratification increased substantially from 1980 to
   2016. Moreover, we find that this trend is almost entirely due to
   growing stratification among aggregate occupational classes rather than
   among the disaggregate occupations nested within them. Finally, a set of
   counterfactual analyses indicate that the rise of occupational class
   stratification is driven by increases in the income returns to
   education, deunionization, and deindustrialization, although the
   relative importance of these factors varies by gender.

AB This study evaluates how authorization status shapes job transitions
   among Mexican and Central American immigrants in the United States.
   Specifically, using data from the Survey of Income and Program
   Participation, we impute legal status and track employment histories for
   authorized and unauthorized workers, as well as native-born
   counterparts, in the less skilled labor market. We distinguish job moves
   based on changes in occupations and employers; and by linking workers
   jobs to expected wages in their occupations, we are able to determine
   whether job transitions result in occupational upgrades or downgrades.
   Results reveal that unauthorized immigrants have lower adjusted rates of
   job mobility, consistent with arguments that their lack of work
   authorization traps their employment. Moreover, when unauthorized
   migrants do change jobs, their transitions are characterized by a
   process of occupational churning in which they cycle between similarly
   positioned jobs and have low rates of upward mobility, both within and
   across firms. We also test the possibility that the wage returns to job
   mobility are conditioned by legal status. Finally, we find that the
   penalties to job mobility associated with unauthorized status are more
   severe for women than men, potentially because of their high levels of
   segregation in socially isolating jobs.

AB Extensive research explores how increasing ethnic out-group populations
   in society affects inter-group attitudes. Drawing on the threat and
   contact hypotheses, this study develops and tests a framework examining
   the role of segregation in the out-group size/prejudice relationship. We
   suggest that whether increasing minority share in a community generates
   processes of contact and/or perceived threat will depend on how
   segregated groups are from one another. This, in turn, will determine
   when high minority share communities have positive, negative, or null
   effects on inter-group attitudes. Using data from white British
   individuals in England, we observe that community segregation moderates
   the effect of community percent non-white British on prejudice, as well
   as mechanisms of positive inter-group contact and perceived threat.
   Residents of more homogeneous communities report relatively warm
   inter-group attitudes, regardless of how segregated they are. Residents
   living among high proportions of out-group where the groups are
   integrated report an improvement in out-group attitudes. It is only
   residents living among large out-group populations where groups are more
   segregated from one anotheruat the nexus of high minority share and high
   segregationuwho report colder out-group attitudes. This higher prejudice
   is driven by both lower positive contact and higher perceived threat in
   these communities. Using two waves of cohort panel data, longitudinal
   analysis provides more robust evidence in support of the
   diversity-segregation nexus framework: communities becoming more
   ethnically mixed and segregated see prejudice increase, while those
   becoming more mixed and integrated see stable, or somewhat improving,
   relations. Collectively, this paper shows that mechanisms of positive
   contact and threat appear conditional on both the size of out-groups in
   an area and how segregated groups are from one another, generating key
   differences in when and how increasing ethnic out-group size affects
   inter-group relations.

AB This paper uses the 20132015 NSFG, a representative US-based dataset of
   individuals 1544, to explore predictors of straight identification among
   all women and men and among subsets with substantial same-sex activity
   and/or attraction. After controlling for attractions and sexual
   practices, homophobia predicted straight identification in all groups.
   Among both groups of women, one femininity attitude and motherhood also
   predicted straight identification. One attitude reflecting alignment
   with normative masculinity significantly predicted straight
   identification among men with substantial same-sex activity and/or
   attraction. This paper also uses two waves of Add Health, a
   representative survey of young adults, to examine change to sexual
   identity over six years. Results show that among individuals who changed
   sexual identities between waves, heightened religiosity and political
   conservatism across waves were associated with increased odds of
   changing to a straight identity for women, but not for men. This
   suggests but does not prove a directional association between attitudes
   and identification for some individuals. Latent class analyses also
   found distinct groups of straight-identified men and women with
   substantial same-sex activity and/or attraction, indicating that it is a
   heterogeneous population in terms of attitudes, including homophobia.
   This suggests that straight identification is due partly to embeddedness
   in straight culture and enjoyment of straight privilege, not simply
   homophobia. While impossible to determine causality, the results show
   that straight identification is strongly related to non-sexual social
   factors, including religiosity and attitudes about sexuality and gender,
   in addition to attractions and sexual practices. The results also
   suggest that homophobia is related to identity formation for women, as
   well as men, but that there is substantial within-group variation.

AB Scholars of world society theory argue that integration in global

   relations, but past research has not examined how global society shapes
   individual gender attitudes. Additionally, past research on gender
   attitudes has not adequately considered contextual country-level

   society theory about the relationship between country-level integration
   and individual gender attitudes using a broad sample of rich and
   developing nations. Using World Values Survey data from 64 countries,
   multilevel models of gender attitudes reveal that increased
   country-level ties to general and womens INGOs are associated with more
   egalitarian individual gender attitudes. This pattern holds after
   accounting for relevant domestic factors, differences based on region
   and religious tradition, other social and political dimensions of

   countries. I conclude by considering the theoretical implications of
   these results.

AB Norwegian national policies strongly incentivize double-earner
   households and gender equality, but various gender gaps persist both at
   work and at home. In these seemingly contradictory situations, what are
   the mechanisms under which Norwegian households allocate their market
   and domestic labor? Drawing on both a large set of administrative data
   and a representative survey, this question is examined from two
   perspectives. First, we focus on the micro-economic processes and
   investigate if Norwegian households act according to economic
   rationality or if they still follow the gender norm A man should earn
   more than his wife. Second, we focus on how Norways contextual factors
   may influence the household experiences when a wife has better market
   productivity. We find that a wife with better market productivity, who
   is thereby facing the risk of outearning her husband, works more hours
   and earns more than her husband, while doing less choresubehavior
   consistent with economic rationality. Further analyses show that womens
   higher relative market productivity is mainly a consequence of having
   low-income husbands, and higher and lower market productivity women are
   surprisingly similar in other sociodemographic aspects. Norwegian
   redistribution policies, through progressive taxation and benefit
   transfers, seem to mitigate the income differences and promote gender
   neutrality in a sense that if couples wish to pursue an untraditional
   division, by preference or by necessity, they seem to be able to do so
   without being held back by the traditional gender expectations or being
   very poor.

AB This research contributes to social movement framing theory about frame
   variation, along with the social problems literature on child
   protectionism. I extend the theorizing on frames by arguing that frame
   variation can be a response to new agendas and goals of countermovements
   and opponents. Specifically, for opponents to rights activism, frame
   variation can be reaction to the assertion of rights for new
   protagonists, specifically their entry into new spaces. This study
   analyzes frame variation of the most deleterious child protectionist
   claims about stranger danger, assertions that the presence of racial,
   gender, and sexual others in public spaces will harm children. This
   paper is a content analysis of political flyers and messages developed
   by Religious Right campaigns at the state and municipal level between
   1974 and 2013; these campaigns framed gay men and transgender woman as
   threats to children in classrooms and bathrooms. For both gay men and
   transgender women, these claims were most common at the start of rights
   advocacy. I argue that challengers make the most overt, deleterious
   arguments about harm to children when new groups initially advocate for
   legal rights and access to new spaces; as marginalized groups become
   more familiar and less strange, challengers make more covert claims
   about these groups, as stranger danger claims have waning cultural and
   political resonance.

AB Although suicide and homicide are two of the leading causes of death,
   theoretical understanding and rigorous quantitative examination of
   homicide-suicideuthe rare combination of suicide and homicideuare
   sparse. We ground homicide-suicide in the stream analogy of lethal
   violence and use three analytical techniques to examine the shared and
   unique correlates of suicide, homicide-suicide, and homicide. Data come
   from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), a pooled,
   cross-sectional time-series database of US victims across 46 states from
   2003 to 2013. A logistic regression model with robust standard errors
   clustered across states and year fixed effects on 105,243 suicide and
   homicide-suicide cases predicts the odds of homicide-suicide relative to
   suicide across a range of theoretically informed covariates. A
   multinomial logistic regression model investigates the factors that
   distinguish 26,243 appended homicide cases (from the NVDRS) from suicide
   and homicide-suicide cases. And, an item-response-based statistical
   approach examines the extent to which homicide-suicide perpetrators are
   primarily homicidal versus primarily suicidal. Results indicated that
   interpersonal stressors and criminal history increased, while physical
   and mental health stressors decreased, the odds of homicide-suicide
   relative to suicide. In addition, the etiology of homicide-suicide more
   closely resembled homicide than suicide. Finally, almost one-half of the
   homicide-suicide cases in our sample were classified as primarily
   homicidal, while less than one-quarter were classified as primarily
   suicidal. Findings suggest that homicide-suicide can be conceptualized
   as a current in the stream analogy of lethal violence, and that the
   prevention of homicide-suicide would be better facilitated via screening
   of violence prevention than suicide prevention programs.

AB This multi-method paper presents a model of individual and contextual
   variation in commutation, a form of clemency that lessens the severity
   of criminal sentences. In the contemporary US context of high
   incarceration, commutation is one of few back-end mechanisms available
   for early release. We first describe national trends, showing a
   significant decline in commutation releases, as well as great geographic
   variation. We then test whether commutation decisions reflect
   consistency or compensation with other forms of punishment. Our
   mixed-effects logit analysis reveals state-level compensation (greater
   commutation in more punitive states) but individual-level consistency
   (greater commutation for more advantaged groups). Commutation is most
   likely for those presenting a mercy package of White race, female sex,
   and less violent criminal histories. In contrast, Black men convicted of
   violence are exceedingly unlikely to be commuted. Nevertheless,
   qualitative evidence suggests that the apparent female advantage in
   commutation may reflect differences in the nature of the underlying
   offense and subsequent prison behavior. These results both parallel and
   extend sociological research on punishment, pointing to commutation as
   an understudied and underutilized mechanism for mercy.

AB Sexual concurrency, or having temporally overlapping sexual
   partnerships, has important consequences for relationship quality and
   individual health, as well as the health and well-being of others
   embedded in larger sexual networks. Although married and cohabiting
   couples have similar, almost universal expectations of sexual
   exclusivity, the former report significantly lower rates of engaging in
   sexual concurrency than the latter. Given that this difference in
   behavior occurs despite similar expectations of sexual fidelity, sexual
   exclusivity can provide an important test of whether marriage has a
   causal effect on relationship behavior. Using data from the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, I estimate an
   instrumental variable model testing whether observed differences in
   sexual concurrency between marital and cohabiting relationships are
   attributable to marriage itself via a recent implementation of the
   special regressor method, an estimator for binary choice models with
   endogenous regressors. I find evidence that, relative to cohabitation,
   marriage reduces the likelihood that an individual will engage in
   concurrent sexual relationships. Finding an effect of marriage in a
   recent cohort of young adults suggests that, despite changes in marriage
   and cohabitation, marriage still influences individual behavior.

AB There has been increasing interest in understanding how macro-level
   contextual characteristics are associated with intra-couple dynamics,
   such as intimate partner violence (IPV). I extend this literature by
   exploring whether contextual changes in womens status are associated
   with IPV at the couple level. I focus on case studies from four Eastern
   African countriesuKenya, Malawi, Uganda, and Zimbabweuwhere there were
   large contextual declines in educational hypergamyua measure of womens
   statusubetween 2000 and 2010. Using Demographic Health Survey data and a
   multilevel approach, I find that regional declines in hypergamy are
   associated with significantly higher probabilities of wives reports of
   recent intimate partner violence in Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. These
   findings are consistent with relative resource theories that predict
   that gender-status inconsistencies correspond with backlash, although
   they extend existing theories by looking at the macro level and
   considering contextual changes in womens status over time. To the
   contrary, regional declines in hypergamy are associated with
   significantly lower probabilities of wives reports of recent intimate
   partner violence in Malawi, which may have to do with a long-standing
   history of matrilineal norms in this context. The analysis enhances
   sociological understandings of how contextual changes in gender
   conditions are associated with micro-level couple outcomes, but also
   points to important heterogeneity across diverse contexts.

AB Many scholars argue that evangelical Christian beliefs and traditions
   are central to dominant conceptions of American national identity, but
   most empirical studies in this area focus on the activities and
   identities of evangelical Christians themselves. Missing is an
   assessment of how evangelical-infused understandings of national
   belonging shape the views of people outside the white evangelical
   subculture. We analyze how Americans of all religious backgrounds
   evaluate a secularized evangelical discourse (SED)ua repertoire of
   political statements that are phrased in religiously nonparticularistic
   terms, but have roots in evangelical Christian history and
   epistemologies and have been politicized through social movements and
   party politics. Using latent class analysis and nationally
   representative survey data, we identify four prevailing profiles of
   support for claims about public religious expression anchored in this
   repertoire: ardent opposition, moderate opposition, moderate support,
   and ardent support. We find that a majority of Americans, not just
   evangelicals, respond positively to propositions that employ SED.
   Consequently, we argue that conservative Christianity influences
   contemporary politics not only by furnishing individuals with beliefs
   and identities, but also by providing a durable and flexible source of
   boundaries around a culturally specific vision of national belonging
   that resonates far beyond the boundaries of the evangelical subculture.

AB This article explains perceived loneliness among people in Europe by
   accounting for cultural factors as well as social isolation. Culturally,
   it measures the impact of both personal and societal
   individualism-collectivism on loneliness. It accounts for social
   isolation by looking at the separate effects of living alone, emotional
   isolation, and relational isolation. Using a 2014 European Social Survey
   sample comprising 36,760 individuals in 21 countries, the study predicts
   loneliness using multilevel logistic regression modeling using both
   maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation procedures. Results indicate
   that societal individualism may strongly reduce loneliness, even after
   taking into account that social isolation partially mediates this
   relationship. Further, the effects of living alone and relational
   isolation depend upon whether one is personally an individualist or
   collectivist. Living alone and relational isolation greatly increase
   loneliness, and such negative effects are somewhat reduced for
   individualists. However, individualists are not protected from the
   negative impacts of emotional isolation at all, and the above moderation
   effects do not hold for the most severe forms of loneliness. Based on
   this analysis, the best case for reduced loneliness for individualists
   and collectivists alike is that they maintain a strong degree of
   multiple forms of social integration and live in an individualist
   society.

AB Tax evasion is a problem everywhere, but it is a much bigger policy
   problem in some countries than it is in others. The Italian government
   estimates that it loses more than 27 percent of total tax revenue to
   evasion, whereas the Swedish government estimates their tax gap to be
   less than 9 percent. What explains this variation? We test for the
   importance of culturally based attitudes and institutionally structured
   rules for taxes and benefits through a unique set of cross-national
   experiments and attitudinal surveys done in multiple locations across
   Italy, the UK, the United States, and Sweden. Participants in each
   location were presented with identical conditions based on institutional
   variations (tax rates, redistribution regimes, benefits) and asked to
   complete a survey afterward concerning their attitudes toward a number
   of social and political issues. A mixed-model analysis of the 2,537
   subjects in our study reveals consistent influence of institutional
   scenarios and three attitude scales measuring pro-redistributive
   ideology, fiscal responsibility, and perceived government competence.
   Country effects, however, are more mixed and inconsistent.

   synergy less frequently than homogeneous groups. We examine how an

AB We use a massive, matched employer-employee database for the United

   inequality from 1978 to 2013. We find that one-third of the rise in the
   variance of (log) earnings occurred within firms, whereas two-thirds of
   the rise occurred due to a rise in the dispersion of average earnings
   between firms. However, this rising between-firm variance is not
   accounted for by the firms themselves but by a widening gap between
   firms in the composition of their workers. This compositional change can
   be split into two roughly equal parts: high-wage workers became
   increasingly likely to work in high-wage firms (i.e., sorting
   increased), and high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work
   with each other (i.e., segregation rose). In contrast, we do not find a
   rise in the variance of firm-specific pay once we control for the worker
   composition in firms. Finally, we find that two-thirds of the rise in
   the within-firm variance of earnings occurred within mega (10,000+

   of earnings compared with smaller firms. JEL Codes: E23, J21, J31.

AB We use insurance claims data covering 28% of individuals with
   employer-sponsored health insurance in the United States to study the
   variation in health spending on the privately insured, examine the
   structure of insurer-hospital contracts, and analyze the variation in
   hospital prices across the nation. Health spending per privately insured
   beneficiary differs by a factor of three across geographic areas and has
   a very low correlation with Medicare spending. For the privately
   insured, half of the spending variation is driven by price variation
   across regions, and half is driven by quantity variation. Prices vary
   substantially across regions, across hospitals within regions, and even
   within hospitals. For example, even for a nearly homogeneous service
   such as lower-limb magnetic resonance imaging, about a fifth of the
   total case-level price variation occurs within a hospital in the cross
   section. Hospital market structure is strongly associated with price
   levels and contract structure. Prices at monopoly hospitals are 12%
   higher than those in markets with four or more rivals. Monopoly
   hospitals also have contracts that load more risk on insurers (e.g.,
   they have more cases with prices set as a share of their charges). In
   concentrated insurer markets the opposite occurs-hospitals have lower
   prices and bear more financial risk. Examining the 366 mergers and
   acquisitions that occurred between 2007 and 2011, we find that prices
   increased by over 6% when the merging hospitals were geographically
   close (e.g., 5 miles or less apart), but not when the hospitals were

   price discount ranging from 55.4% to 59.9% compared with those without
   the same connections. These firms also purchased slightly more land. In
   return, the provincial party secretaries who provided the discount to
   these "princeling" firms are 23.4% more likely to be promoted to
   positions of national leadership. To curb corruption, President Xi
   Jinping stepped up investigations and strengthened personnel control at
   the province level. Using a spatially matched sample (e.g., within a
   500-meter radius), we find a reduction in corruption of between 42.6%
   and 31.5% in the provinces either targeted by the central inspection
   teams or whose party secretary was replaced by one appointed by Xi.
   Accordingly, this crackdown on corruption has also significantly reduced
   the promotional prospects of those local officials who rely on supplying
   a discount to get ahead. JEL Codes: D73, P26, H7, O17.

AB Exploring the symbolic meaning of guns in the United States may be one
   the best ways to approach theoretical questions concerning the effect of
   "culture in action" because it focuses on a single object-the gun-which
   brims with symbolic power far beyond its physical utility. Using data
   from the Baylor Religion Surveys (Wave 4), we investigate the extent to
   which guns empower gun owners morally and emotionally. We also
   investigate the diversity of gun owners. We find a wide range of gun
   empowerment among gun owners, and that this relationship is related to
   gender, race, religiosity, political views, gun use, and economic
   distress. Our findings also indicate that Americans' attachment to guns
   is not explained entirely by regional, religious, or political cultures.
   Instead, we demonstrate that white men in economic distress find comfort
   in guns as a means to reestablish a sense of individual power and moral
   certitude. Gun empowerment, in turn, affects opinions about gun action
   and policy.

AB Since beginning operations in Central Appalachia, coal producers have
   economically exploited residents and exposed them to severe health risks
   associated with pollution. Despite causing these problems, the industry
   enjoys vigorous popular support. Drawing on nine months of immersive
   ethnography in "Shale County," this article examines why many
   Appalachians endorse the coal industry despite its negative
   externalities. I find that Appalachia's subordinate relationship to the
   rest of the nation plays a profound role in conditioning the region's
   pro-industry, anti-environmental views. Many Appalachians feel like the
   federal government neglects them, and like urban America, devalues them.
   Drawing upon Antonio Gramsci's theory of hegemony, I show how the coal
   industry capitalizes upon these feelings by promoting coal heritage-a
   carefully curated cultural construction that emphasizes selective
   aspects of Appalachian history while erasing those that challenge its
   domination. Coal heritage, I show, conveys environmentalism as an attack
   on Appalachians' right to economic opportunity, their role in the
   national division of labor, and their moral worth. It frames industry
   representatives, on the other hand, as guardians of regional interests
   and values.

AB The size of our ecological footprint is often attributed to those social
   processes governing the consumption of material resources, reflecting
   the tendency within sociology to pay far more attention to our social
   constructions of nature, and our effects on nature, but far less
   attention to natural processes themselves. However, our level of
   ecological disruption is, more precisely, a function of the effort
   required to exploit natural resources and convert them into the things
   we value for use and exchange. As the quality of those resources
   declines in response to historic exploitation, effort increases, and
   hence so does our ecological impact, a tendency that interacts with
   social processes to produce emergent outcomes. This effort factor
   constitutes an important but largely overlooked feature of
   social-ecological metabolic relations, one that can offer fruitful
   opportunities for advances in scholarship in environmental sociology,
   and for environmental monitoring and mediation efforts by states and
   civil societies. The effort factor constitutes an important causal
   mechanism in our socioecological relations, the effects of which are
   best conceived through the lens of critical realism. This article offers
   a conceptual elaboration of the effort factor, and a case study analysis
   with reference to the historical development of oil, with particular
   emphasis on Alberta, Canada, which highlights the disruptive tendencies

   differences in responses to-and behavior in-subordinate roles. In a
   series of experimental studies I find that men are more publicly
   critical of leaders and more willing to undermine leaders than are
   women. In two studies I find that men are more publicly critical in both
   high and low status subordinate roles, and under both men and women
   leaders. In a third study, I find that men and women do not differ in
   their private behavior or evaluations of a leader and that gender
   differences in subordinate behavior and evaluations only arise in
   publicly visible evaluations, behavior, and criticism. Gender
   differences in public behavior and evaluation may be due to men
   exaggerating their criticism to restore a threatened sense of status or
   masculinity, or due to women tempering their criticism due to gender
   stereotypes that discourage assertive and critical behavior for women.
   Either explanation suggests that men and women perform gendered
   expectations in public and behave in ways that can disadvantage women
   leaders.

AB This article examines variation in the association between maternal
   education and infant mortality across the 50 U.S. states. An analysis of
   22,967,018 Vital Statistics records from 1997-2002, reveals evidence of
   dramatic cross-state differences. In some states, infants born to
   mothers with less than 12 years of schooling are more than twice as
   likely to die as infants of mothers with 4 years of college or more.
   Other states see far more equality between these groups. I then evaluate
   two components of state medical systems that are predicted to be
   associated with this variation in the magnitude of inequalities in
   infant mortality: neonatal intensive care units and primary care
   physician supply. More widespread availability of neonatal intensive
   care is associated with reduced inequalities in infant mortality. In
   contrast, the supply of primary care is linked to slightly larger
   differences in infant mortality between mothers with low and high
   education.

AB Although Black mothers are disproportionately represented among formerly
   incarcerated mothers in the United States, existing research has largely
   neglected to document the challenges they face in resuming their
   parenting roles after prison or jail. This study addresses this gap
   using 18 months of participant observations with formerly incarcerated
   Black women to examine how state surveillance under post-release
   supervision and child welfare services shapes and constrains formerly
   incarcerated Black women's mothering practices. The study develops a
   typology of three context-specific strategies these women employ to
   anticipate, react to, and cope with state interventions that threaten
   their mothering: collective motherwork, hypervigilant motherwork, and
   crisis motherwork. These findings suggest that contrary to popular
   constructions of formerly incarcerated Black women as negligent mothers,
   they navigate multiple, overlapping sources of violence to protect their
   children. Yet, the labor of navigating the state structures that put
   their children at risk often placed these women in conflict with the
   state. This paradox suggests the state criminalizes the maternal labor
   of formerly incarcerated Black women and that these state logics are
   used to justify state intervention in Black women's post-incarceration
   parenting.

AB A rich literature on commensuration and standards of evaluation has
   yielded important findings on how items are valued. Over the course of a
   two-year ethnography, we witnessed one effort to create a new economic
   practice-a monthly swap of "homemade food"-start promisingly but
   ultimately fail as participants were unable to reach consensus on
   valuations. They rejected each other's offerings on numerous grounds,
   including proximity to industrial food, packaging, and excess
   "artisanal-ness" and alterity, forcing participants to "thread the
   needle" in search of acceptable qualities. Multiple or competing logics
   can be reconciled with clear institutional definitions, by using money,
   or via relational work. In our site, none of these mechanisms were
   operative. Instead, a multivalent alternative identity biased toward
   oppositional criteria impeded valuations and robust exchange. We believe
   this problem is common to a larger class of organizations that define
   themselves in opposition to the dominant market.

   psychological theories often assume concrete social mechanisms that

   the CILS4EU data on Germany, The Netherlands, and Sweden (15,203
   individuals, 50 per cent girls, M-AGE 14.9years), we construct two
   measures of the most significant peers around individuals, i.e. of the
   peer milieu, and explore the salience of educational aspirations in
   these milieus. Applying longitudinal logistic regression models and
   first-difference models with individual-level fixed effects, we find
   evidence for clustering of individuals with the same educational
   aspirations within classrooms, underlining the relevance of peers for
   educational success.

AB Growing up in a disadvantaged parental neighbourhood is related to
   long-term exposure to similar neighbourhoods as adults. However, there
   are multiple socio-spatial contexts besides the residential
   neighbourhood to which individuals are exposed over the life course,
   such as households, schools, and places of work and leisure, which also
   influence their outcomes. For children and adolescents, the school
   environment is especially important. We argue that leaving these
   contexts out of consideration in models of neighbourhood effects could
   lead to a misspecification of the relevance of the residential
   environment in determining individual outcomes. This study examines the
   joint influence of the parental background, the parental neighbourhood,
   and a compositional measure of the childhood school environment, on
   individual neighbourhood trajectories later in life. We use Dutch
   longitudinal register data to study a complete cohort of adolescents
   from 1999 to 2012. We fit cross-classified multilevel models to
   partition the variance of schools and parental neighbourhoods over time.
   We find that parental neighbourhood quality strongly determines
   children's residential outcomes later in life. The variation in
   individual neighbourhood outcomes at the school level is explained by
   the ethnicity, parental income, and personal income of the research
   population, suggesting grouping of children from particular backgrounds
   into specific school environments.

AB In present-day western societies grandparents and grandchildren have
   longer years of shared lifetime than ever before. We investigate whether
   children with more grandparent resources have a higher probability of
   achieving the general secondary degree compared with children with fewer
   resources, or whether shared lifetime with grandparents increases the
   probability of achieving the general secondary degree. We use
   high-quality Finnish Census Panel data and apply sibling random and
   fixed-effects models that also control for all unobserved factors shared
   by siblings. Grandparents' education and socioeconomic status have only
   a limited ability to explain a grandchild's educational achievement.
   However, the sibling fixed-effects models reveal that every shared year
   between grandparents and grandchildren increases a grandchild's
   likelihood of completing general secondary education by 1 percentage
   point, on average. The effect of shared lifetime is conditional on
   grandparental type, family resources, and the size of the extended
   family. Maternal grandmothers have a positive effect on grandchildren's
   education in low-income families. Paternal grandmothers provide a link
   to the resources available through the extended family network,
   independent of their own resources. The same effects were not observed
   for grandfathers.

AB There is evidence to show that, even among individuals who have
   relatively high levels of cognitive ability, coming from disadvantaged
   social origins hinders their chances of securing high levels of
   qualification and advantaged labour market positions. But it has been
   argued that lifelong learning could provide second chances for these
   people through providing an alternative route to high qualifications.
   The main objective of this article is to examine this issue. We pose two
   questions. Does further education enable individuals from disadvantaged
   origins but with a high level of cognitive ability to improve on their
   initial levels of qualification? And does any such improvement then lead
   to better labour market positions, in terms of social class, for these
   individuals? Based on the complete qualification histories of
   individuals in the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study, our analyses show
   that men and women from disadvantaged origins, especially if of high
   ability, are indeed able to raise their levels of qualification, but
   they do so mainly via the attainment of further vocational, rather than
   further academic, qualifications. And while our results also indicate
   that acquiring further academic qualifications does improve the upward
   mobility chances of people of high ability from disadvantaged
   backgrounds, a similar effect does not show up from acquiring further
   vocational qualifications. In addition, we find that there remains a
   substantial direct effect' of cognitive ability on class attainment.
   This suggests that obtaining further academic qualifications is only one
   channel for upward mobility and that there are others which are more
   directly related to ability.

AB This article adds an intergenerational perspective to the study of
   perceived ethnic discrimination. It proposes the conjecture that
   perceived discrimination tends to increase with parental education,
   particularly among those children of immigrants who have attained only
   mediocre levels of education themselves. I discuss that this conjecture
   may be developed as an argument that comes in two versions: a narrow
   version about explicit downward (intergenerational) mobility and a wide
   version about unfulfilled mobility aspirations more generally. Analyses
   based on the six-country comparative EURISLAM survey support the
   argument: parental education positively predicts perceived
   discrimination in general, but among the less educated, this relation is
   most pronounced, whereas it is absent among those with tertiary
   education. A replication and falsification test based on the German
   IAB-SOEP Migration Sample reconfirms the main finding and provides
   further original pieces of evidence. The analyses suggest processes
   associated with unfulfilled mobility aspirations as the more plausible
   underlying reason.

   indicate that, compared to entrants with general education, vocationally
   educated entrants are less likely to have problematic labour market

AB The debate over whether contingent (and typically more precarious)

   tended to focus on transitions rather than longer-run pathways. This
   approach cannot accurately identify indirect pathways from contingent to
   permanent employment or trap' pathways involving short spells in other
   states. It also fails to distinguish between those experiencing
   contingent employment as a blip' and those with longer spells. This
   article employs a different approach involving sequence analysis.
   Exploiting longitudinal data for Australia, evidence for the
   co-existence of pathways that correspond to bridge' and trap'
   characterizations of contingent employment is found. Further, in the
   case of casual employmentthe most common form of contingent employment

AB Previous research on overeducation focused on labour market entrants and
   investigated the role of individual characteristics and, more recently,
   labour market and educational institutions. This article shifts the
   focus to primeage workers, exploring the relation between economic
   conditions, related labour market dynamics, and overeducation across 16
   European countries in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis. We
   regard cross-sectional overeducation rates as the result of past labour
   market dynamics involving employers' hiring and dismissal decisions and
   employees' job mobility. Based on data from the 2011/2012 Programme for
   the International Assessment of Adult Competences (PIAAC), we estimate
   mixed-effects linear-probability models. We find that overeducation
   risks are higher for individuals who experienced job mobility after the
   outbreak of the crisis (movers) than for those who were able to keep
   their jobs, with workers who changed their job before the crisis
   (short-term stayers) experiencing higher overeducation risks than
   long-term stayers. These differences are partly explained by
   compositional and contextual factorshowever, our newly introduced
   differentiation of labour market dynamics profiles also shows an
   independent effect. Moreover, tertiary graduates are more likely to be
   overeducated than workers with upper-secondary qualificationscontrolling
   for workers' skill heterogeneity. The findings on macroeconomic
   conditions are mixed: overeducation risks are higher in contexts of
   poorer economic conditions and even more so for movers; however, the
   multiplicative negative effect for movers disappears after controlling
   for job characteristics. This finding suggests that post-crisis mobility
   channeled workers more often into labour market segments with inferior
   job conditions where the risk of overeducation is generally higher.

AB This study applies exchange theory to transnational marriages between
   descendants of migrants to Europe, and partners from their
   (grand)parents' country of origin. Such marriages could offer
   socio-economic benefits for the European partner/family, if the
   opportunity of migration attracts a more highly educated spouse. The
   translation of educational capital into socio-economic benefits,
   however, is mediated by the labour market position of migrant spouses.
   In this study we explore the relationships between transnational
   marriage, education, and employment, by comparing the characteristics of
   spouses in transnational couples with those in intranational couples.
   Analyses are based on UK Labour Force Survey data (2004-2014) for two
   groups in which transnational marriage is commonPakistani Muslims and
   Indian Sikhs. We find that educational homogamy is the dominant pattern
   in both intranational and transnational couples, and that migrant
   spouses have a disadvantaged labour market position compared to
   non-migrant spouses with the same level of educationwith variation
   across gender and ethnic groups. Our findings do not support a view of
   transnational marriage as socio-economic exchange but do suggest
   education plays a role in spousal choice in these marriages.

AB Organizational theory scholars typically see organizations as
   race-neutral bureaucratic structures, while race and ethnicity scholars
   have largely neglected the role of organizations in the social
   construction of race. The theory developed in this article bridges these
   subfields, arguing that organizations are racial structures-cognitive
   schemas connecting organizational rules to social and material
   resources. I begin with the proposition that race is constitutive of
   organizational foundations, hierarchies, and processes. Next, I develop
   four tenets: (1) racialized organizations enhance or diminish the agency
   of racial groups; (2) racialized organizations legitimate the unequal
   distribution of resources; (3) Whiteness is a credential; and (4) the
   decoupling of formal rules from organizational practice is often
   racialized. I argue that racialization theory must account for how both
   state policy and individual attitudes are filtered through-and changed
   by-organizations. Seeing race as constitutive of organizations helps us
   better understand the formation and everyday functioning of
   organizations. Incorporating organizations into a structural theory of
   racial inequality can help us better understand stability, change, and
   the institutionalization of racial inequality. I conclude with an
   overview of internal and external sources of organizational change and a
   discussion of how the theory of racialized organizations may set the
   agenda for future research.

AB A growing body of research documents the importance of studying
   households in the top one percent of U.S. income distribution because
   they control enormous resources. However, little is known about whose
   income-men's or women's-is primarily responsible for pushing households
   into the one percent and whether women have individual pathways to
   earning one percent status based on their income. Using the 1995 to 2016
   Surveys of Consumer Finances, we analyze gender income patterns in the
   one percent. Results show that women's income is sufficient for one
   percent status in only 1 in 20 of all elite households. Although
   self-employment and higher education increase the likelihood that women
   will personally earn sufficient income for one percent status, marrying
   a man with good income prospects is a woman's main route to the one
   percent. In contrast, men's one percent status is most closely
   associated with their own characteristics (self-employment and higher
   education). Importantly, the gender gap in personally earning one
   percent income has not narrowed since the mid- to late-1990s, indicating
   another area in which gender progress has stalled. This research
   suggests that men retain most of the primary breadwinning positions in
   top income households and that a financial glass ceiling remains firmly
   intact at the one percent level.

AB Research on precarious work and its consequences overwhelmingly focuses
   on the economic dimension of precarity, epitomized by low wages. But the
   rise in precarious work also involves a major shift in its temporal
   dimension, such that many workers now experience routine instability in
   their work schedules. This temporal instability represents a fundamental
   and under-appreciated manifestation of the risk shift from firms to
   workers. A lack of suitable existing data, however, has precluded
   investigation of how precarious scheduling practices affect workers'
   health and well-being. We use an innovative approach to collect survey
   data from a large and strategically selected segment of the U.S.
   workforce: hourly workers in the service sector. These data reveal that
   exposure to routine instability in work schedules is associated with
   psychological distress, poor sleep quality, and unhappiness. Low wages
   are also associated with these outcomes, but unstable and unpredictable
   schedules are much more strongly associated. Precarious schedules affect
   worker well-being in part through the mediating influence of household
   economic insecurity, yet a much larger proportion of the association is
   driven by work-life conflict. The temporal dimension of work is central
   to the experience of precarity and an important social determinant of
   well-being.

AB Recent sociological work shows that culture is an important causal
   variable in labor market outcomes. Does the same hold for product
   markets? To answer this question, we study a product market in which
   selection decisions occur absent face-to-face interaction between
   intermediaries and short-term contract workers. We find evidence of
   "product-based" cultural matching operating as a pathway to inequality.
   Relying on quantitative and qualitative observational data and
   semi-structured interviews with intermediaries in trade fiction
   publishing, we show intermediaries culturally match themselves to
   manuscripts as a normal feature of doing "good work." We propose three
   organizational conditions under which "encultured biases" come to the
   fore in product selection, and a fourth resulting in inequalities along
   demographic lines and other markers of perceived cultural proximity and
   distance. We close with a discussion of other settings in which
   product-based cultural matching is likely to occur, call for the
   investigation of cultural matching beyond previously theorized
   conditions, and argue for the inclusion of cultural products in the
   broader movement toward reconsidering culture as a causal factor.

AB Sociological accounts of urban disinvestment processes rarely assess how
   landlords' variable investment strategies may be facilitated or
   constrained by the legal environment. Nor do they typically examine how
   such factors might, in turn, affect housing conditions for city
   dwellers. Over the past two decades, the advent and diffusion of the
   limited liability company (LLC) has reshaped the legal landscape of
   rental ownership. Increasingly, rental properties are owned by business
   organizations that limit investor liability, rather than by individual
   landlords who own property in their own names. An analysis of
   administrative records and survey data from Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
   demonstrates that signs of housing disinvestment increase when
   properties transition from individual to LLC ownership. This increase is
   not explained by selection on property characteristics or by divergent
   pre-transfer trends. Results affirm that real estate investors are
   responsive to changes in the legal environment and that the protective
   structure of the LLC facilitates housing disinvestment in Milwaukee.
   Elaborating the role of real estate investors can deepen accounts of
   neighborhood change processes and help explain variation in local
   housing conditions. Ultimately, public policies that enable business
   operators to circumscribe or reallocate risk may generate unintended
   costs for consumers and the public.

AB State-level public assistance agencies completed nearly a million SNAP
   fraud investigations in fiscal year 2016. These investigations hinge on
   compiling incriminating information about clients. Drawing on interviews
   with welfare fraud workers in five U.S. states, this article shows how
   fraud investigators creatively exploit clients' social networks to
   extract such information, and thus use clients' social ties against
   them. Investigators gain some information through elective cooperation,
   when people voluntarily implicate others. Fraud workers say these
   denunciations typically arise from negative-valence ties (bad blood).
   Other times, investigators co-opt neutral or positive-valence ties (good
   will) for enforcement purposes. This co-optation includes eliciting
   information from unwitting acquaintances and exploiting clients' own
   online social networking activity. These findings demonstrate social
   ties' appropriability, through which they serve as resources for
   relational outsiders' interests. Repurposing welfare clients' social
   ties for fraud enforcement presents a two-fold threat to subsistence and
   social mobility prospects: it imposes punishments-including program
   disqualifications-while simultaneously damaging social support networks.
   These enforcement practices reveal appropriability as an unrecognized
   property of social ties, particularly for socioeconomically marginalized
   people, and constitute a noteworthy element of contemporary poverty
   governance.

   that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the

AB A "Nash equilibrium in Nash bargains" has become a workhorse bargaining

   noncooperative foundation for "Nash-in-Nash" bargaining that extends
   Rubinstein's alternating offers model to multiple upstream and
   downstream firms. We provide conditions on firms' marginal contributions
   under which there exists, for sufficiently short time between offers, an
   equilibrium with agreement among all firms at prices arbitrarily close
   to Nash-in-Nash prices, that is, each pair's Nash bargaining solution
   given agreement by all other pairs. Conditioning on equilibria without
   delayed agreement, limiting prices are unique. Unconditionally, they are
   unique under stronger assumptions.

AB Empirical work has drawn attention to the high degree of productivity

   This paper examines the allocational efficiency of such markets.
   Productivity differences introduce two new margins of potential
   inefficiency: selection of the right distribution of firms and
   allocation of the right quantities across firms. We show that these
   considerations affect welfare and policy analysis, and market power
   across firms leads to distortions in resource allocation. Demand-side
   elasticities determine how resources are misallocated and when increased

   percent at some of the largest firms. Roughly one-third of advisers with
   misconduct are repeat offenders. Approximately half of advisers lose
   their jobs after misconduct. The labor market partially undoes
   firm-level discipline by rehiring such advisers. Firms that persistently
   engage in misconduct coexist with firms that have clean records. We show
   that this phenomenon may be explained by some firms "specializing" in

   the benefits of peace brokering. We study a model in which unmediated
   peace talks are effective at improving the peace chance for given
   militarization but lead to more militarization and ultimately to a
   higher incidence of war. Instead, a form of third-party mediation
   inspired by work of Myerson effectively brokers peace in emerged

AB We conduct an experiment to study whether individuals save more when
   information about the progress toward their self-set savings goal is
   shared with another village member (a "monitor"). We develop a
   reputational framework to explore how a monitor's effectiveness depends
   on her network position. Savers who care about whether others perceive
   them as responsible should save more with central monitors, who more
   widely disseminate information, and proximate monitors, who pass
   information to individuals with whom the saver interacts frequently. We
   randomly assign monitors to savers and find that monitors on average
   increase savings by 36%. Consistent with the framework, more central and
   proximate monitors lead to larger increases in savings. Moreover,
   information flows through the network, with 63% of monitors telling
   others about the saver's progress. Fifteen months after the conclusion
   of the experiment, other villagers have updated their beliefs about the
   saver's responsibility in response to the intervention.

AB We show that even in the absence of data on individual decisions, the
   distribution of individual attitudes towards risk can be identified from
   the aggregate conditions that characterize equilibrium on markets for
   risky assets. Taking parimutuel horse races as a textbook model of
   contingent markets, we allow for heterogeneous bettors with very general
   risk preferences, including non-expected utility. Under a standard
   single-crossing condition on preferences, we identify the distribution
   of preferences among the population of bettors and we derive testable
   implications. We estimate the model on data from U.S. races.
   Specifications based on expected utility fit the data very poorly. Our
   results stress the crucial importance of nonlinear probability
   weighting. They also suggest that several dimensions of heterogeneity

   show that a stable matching exists in a large market with a continuum of

   continuously as the set of available workers changes. We also study the
   existence and structure of stable matchings under preferences exhibiting
   substitutability and indifferences in a large market. Building on these

AB We study economies with Knightian uncertainty about state prices. We
   introduce an equilibrium concept with sublinear prices and prove that
   equilibria exist under weak conditions. In general, such equilibria lead
   to inefficient allocations; they coincide with Arrow-Debreu equilibria
   if and only if the values of net trades are ambiguity-free in mean. In
   economies without aggregate uncertainty, inefficiencies are generic.
   Equilibrium allocations under price uncertainty are efficient in a

   Arrow-Debreu equilibria turn out to be non-robust with respect to the

AB Comparing the 1935 and 1975 U.S. birth cohorts, wages of married women
   grew twice as fast as for married men, and the wage gap between married
   and single women turned from negative to positive. The employment rate
   of married women also increased sharply, while that of other groups
   remained quite stable. To better understand these diverse patterns, we
   develop a life-cycle model incorporating individual and household
   decisions about education, employment, marriage/divorce, and fertility.
   The model provides an excellent fit to wage and employment patterns,
   along with changes in education, marriage/divorce rates, and fertility.
   We assume fixed preferences, but allow for four exogenously changing
   factors: (i) mother's education, health, and taxes/transfers; (ii)
   marriage market opportunities and divorce costs; (iii) the wage
   structure and job offers; (iv) contraception technology. We quantify how
   each factor contributed to changes across cohorts. We find that factor
   (iii) was the most important force driving the increase in relative
   wages of married women, but that all four factors are important for
   explaining the many socio-economic changes that occurred in the past 50
   years. Finally, we use the model to simulate a shift from joint to
   individual taxation. In a revenue-neutral simulation, we predict this
   would increase employment of married women by 9% and the marriage rate
   by 8.1%.

AB Is there a role for governments in emerging countries to accelerate
   economic development by intervening in product and factor markets? To
   address this question, we study optimal dynamic Ramsey policies in a
   standard growth model with financial frictions. The optimal policy
   intervention involves pro-business policies like suppressed wages in
   early stages of the transition, resulting in higher entrepreneurial
   profits and faster wealth accumulation. This, in turn, relaxes borrowing
   constraints in the future, leading to higher labor productivity and
   wages. In the long run, optimal policy reverses sign and becomes
   pro-worker. In a multi-sector extension, optimal policy subsidizes
   sectors with a latent comparative advantage and, under certain
   circumstances, involves a depreciated real exchange rate. Our results
   provide an efficiency rationale, but also identify caveats, for many of
   the development policies actively pursued by dynamic emerging economies.

AB Households face large income uncertainty that varies substantially over

   variations in a model with incomplete markets, liquid and illiquid
   assets, and a nominal rigidity. Heightened uncertainty depresses
   aggregate demand as households respond by hoarding liquid "paper" assets
   for precautionary motives, thereby reducing both illiquid physical
   investment and consumption demand. We document the empirical response of
   portfolio liquidity and aggregate activity to surprise changes in
   idiosyncratic income uncertainty and find both to be quantitatively in
   line with our model. The welfare consequences of uncertainty shocks and
   of the policy response thereto depend crucially on a household's asset

   Using data from the American Community Survey and American Time Use
   Survey, we structurally estimate our model and explore empirical design
   problems. We allow taxes to depend upon marital status, with the form of
   tax jointness for married couples unrestricted. We find that the optimal
   tax system for married couples is characterized by negative jointness,
   although the welfare gains from jointness are modest. These welfare
   gains are then shown to be increasing in the gender wage gap, with taxes
   here, as in the case of gender based taxation, providing an instrument

AB Scholars who study immigrant economic progress often point to the

   in the early 20th century and draw inferences about whether today's
   immigrants will follow a similar trajectory. However, little is known
   about the mechanisms that allowed for European upward advancement. This
   article begins to fill this gap by analyzing how naturalization policies
   influenced the economic success of immigrants across generations.
   Specifically, the author creates new panel data sets that follow
   immigrants and their children across complete-count U.S. censuses to
   understand the economic consequences of citizenship attainment. The
   author finds that naturalization raised occupational attainment for the
   first generation that then allowed children to have greater educational
   attainment and labor market success. He argues that economic progress
   was conditioned by political statuses for European-origin groups during
   the first half of the 20th century.

AB Studies of secrecy argue that criminal conspiracies are discovered when

   corporate crimes often remain secret even after crucial information has
   become public. To explain such cases, this article shifts attention from
   secret keepers to their audiences and proposes a relational theory of
   complex secrets, whose discovery requires finding and assembling sets of
   information relative to a guiding conception of the whole-a gestalt. To
   illustrate this theory, the article studies the Ponzi scheme perpetrated
   by Samuel Insull's utility empire in the 1920s and 1930s. An analysis of
   the search patterns of two failed and two successful investigations in
   the network of Insull companies reveals why early investigations failed:
   they relied on assumptions about the system that rendered the internal
   relations between the information fragments unlikely. Conspiracies can
   thus hide in plain sight by creating a situation of systematic ambiguity
   for their audiences.

   overcharged relative to the market value of a property, the authors find
   exploitation of tenants to be highest in poor neighborhoods. Landlords
   in poor neighborhoods also extract higher profits from housing units.
   Property values and tax burdens are considerably lower in depressed
   residential areas, but rents are not. Because landlords operating in
   poor communities face more risks, they hedge their position by raising
   rents on all tenants, carrying the weight of social structure into
   price. Since losses are rare, landlords typically realize the surplus
   risk charge as higher profits. Promoting a relational approach to the
   analysis of inequality, this study demonstrates how the market
   strategies of landlords contribute to high rent burdens in low-income

AB The administrative ability of the state to deliver effective policy is

   attention to domestic forces underpinning state capacity, the authors
   focus on world system pressures from Western-dominated international
   organizations. Scrutinizing policy reforms mandated by the International
   Monetary Fund (IMF), the authors argue that "structural conditions"
   exert deleterious effects on bureaucratic quality by increasing the risk
   of bureaucrats falling prey to special interests and narrowing potential
   policy instruments available to them. The authors test these arguments
   using a new data set on IMF conditionality from 1985 to 2014. Their
   analysis shows that structural conditions-especially conditions on
   privatization, price deregulation, and public sector employment-reduce
   bureaucratic quality. Using instrumentation techniques, the authors also
   discount the possibility that the relationship is driven by the IMF
   imposing structural conditions precisely in countries with low
   bureaucratic quality. A careful reconsideration of IMF policy reforms is
   therefore required to avoid undermining local institutions.
