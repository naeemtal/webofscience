TI Judicial Reshuffles and Women Justices in Latin America

EA JUL 2020
PY 2020
AB Can weak judicial institutions facilitate the advancement of women to
   the high courts? We explore the relationship between weak institutions
   and gender diversification by analyzing the consequences of judicial
   reshuffles in Latin America. Our theory predicts that institutional
   disruptions will facilitate the appointment of women justices, but only
   when left parties control the nomination process. We test this argument
   using difference-in-differences and dynamic panel models for 18 Latin
   American countries between 1961 and 2014. The analysis offers support
   for our hypothesis, but gains in gender diversification are modest in
   size and hard to sustain over time. Political reshuffles may produce
   short-term advances for women in the judiciary, but they do not
   represent a path to substantive progress in gender equality.

AB The Silk Roads stretched across Eurasia, connecting East and West for
   centuries. At its height, the network of trade routes enabled merchants
   to travel from China to the Mediterranean Sea, carrying with them
   high-value commercial goods, the exchange of which encouraged urban
   growth and prosperity. We examine the extent to which urban centers
   thrived or withered as a function of shocks to trade routes,
   particularly political fragmentation along natural travel paths. We find
   that political fragmentation along the roads to Aleppo and historic
   Chang'an - major terminus locations for cross-regional trade-damaged
   city growth. These conclusions contribute to our understanding of how a
   premodern international system operated through an examination of
   exchange between the two most developed world regions of the medieval
   and early modern periods, China and the Muslim East.

AB This article advances a couple-level framework to examine how parenthood
   shapes within-family gender inequality by education in three countries
   that vary in their normative and policy context: the United States,
   Germany, and the United Kingdom. We trace mothers' share of couple
   earnings and variation by her education in the 10-year window around
   first birth, using long-running harmonized panel surveys from the 1990s
   and 2000s (N= 4,117 couples and 28,488 couple-years) and an event study
   methodology that leverages within-couple variation in earnings pre- and
   post-birth. Our results show steep declines in her share of couple
   earnings following first birth across the three countries that persist
   over several years of follow-up. Declines are smallest in the United
   States, due to U.S. mothers' higher employment and longer work hours.
   Declines are also smaller among female partners without a college degree
   in the United States, where mothers have less work-family support and
   fewer options to manage work and family on one income. Results shed
   light on how parenthood plays into gender inequality within couples, and
   how country context shapes couple dynamics and inequality across
   households.

AB Technological advances and the big-data revolution have facilitated
   fine-grained, high-frequency, low-cost measurement of individuals' work.
   Yet we understand little about the influences of suchquantification of
   workon workers' behavior and performance. This article investigates how
   and when quantification of work affects worker productivity. We argue
   that quantification affects worker productivity viaauto-gamification, or
   workers' inadvertent transformation of work into an independent,
   individual-level game. We further argue that quantification is likely to
   raise productivity in a context of simple work, where auto-gamification
   is motivating because quantified metrics adequately measure the work
   being performed. When work is complex, by contrast, quantification
   reduces productivity because quantified metrics cannot adequately
   measure the multifaceted work being performed, causing auto-gamification
   to be demotivating. To substantiate our argument, we study
   implementation of an RFID measurement technology that quantifies
   individual workers' output in real time at a garment factory in India.
   Qualitative evidence uncovers the auto-gamification mechanism and three
   conditions that enable it; a natural experiment tests the consequences
   of quantification of work for worker productivity. This article
   contributes to the study of quantification, work games, technology, and
   organizations, and we explore the policy implications of further
   quantification of work.

AB This study proposes and applies a novel method for empirically
   evaluating the role of social structure in the school sorting process.
   We use administrative records from Baltimore City and suburban Baltimore
   County public elementary schools (2011 to 2015) to generate a network of
   schools based on student transfers. We then apply repeated calculations
   of the Louvian method of community detection to estimate emergent sets
   of schools that similar parents are likely to consider-which we
   termemergent consideration sets-and use gravity models to explore the
   role of social structure, demographics, and geography in observed
   enrollment patterns. We find that our network-derived emergent
   consideration sets are better defined by structural boundaries than by
   student composition or proficiency alone. Within consideration sets,
   students tend to avoid schools with relatively higher levels of free-
   and reduced-price meal eligibility and flock toward schools with higher
   proficiency levels. School racial composition, however, plays a much
   smaller role in predicting movement between schools, in part because
   structural constraints generate racially homogeneous consideration sets.
   Together, these findings highlight how regional social and geographic
   organization shapes school segregation processes and the policies used
   to combat them.

TI "You have to do something": Snoring, sleep interembodiment and the

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY
DI 10.1111/1468-4446.12774
EA JUL 2020
PY 2020
AB Although the sociology of sleep is a growing subfield, little is known
   about agency in the context of sleep. This article contributes to the
   sociological literature by showing how different types of agency emerge
   as a result of sleep interembodiment (i.e., experiencing sleep partners'
   bodies as intertwined). The study draws on qualitative data generated
   through in-depth interviews with 70 snorers and 20 sleep partners of
   snorers. Interviews were conducted in Israel and were analysed following
   constructivist grounded theory principles. Results indicate that two
   types of agency coexist and, in fact, co-constitute one another: The
   first type, herein termedmaterial agency,reflects the post-humanist
   tradition, which conceptualizes agents as entities (whether human or
   nonhuman) that alter a state of affairs by making a difference in
   another agent's action. This type of agency exists in both wakefulness
   and throughout periods of sleep, as the snorer's body acts and interacts
   with a partner's body in ways that engender significant change in their
   lives, relationships, and actions. In contrast, the second type, herein
   termedreflexive agency, reflects the humanist tradition, which regards
   agency as individuals' creative and assertive capacities motivated by
   intentionality and reflexivity. This type of agency declines
   significantly during stages of deep sleep but re-emerges in response to
   partners' actions. The article adds to the literature by refining the
   concept of agency and elucidating its relationship to both
   accountability and interembodiment. In addition, the article provides
   much-needed empirical evidence showing how "personal responsibility" for
   health, as required by neoliberal discourses, is invoked within
   families, specifically with regard to sleep. This study therefore shows
   how certain macro-level structures of neoliberalism are enacted and
   reinforced within micro-level interactions.

   discontinuity to estimate the effect of attention to unemployment news
   on voting, holding constant the actual economic conditions on the

AB How can we make sense of numerous instances of experts in politics, law
   enforcement, national security, military defense, fire arms, public
   health, culture, and history working closely with creators of scripted
   television series in the USA today? Why do TV makers need them? Why and
   how do these experts come to Hollywood? In order to answer these
   questions, I carried out a Bourdieusian field analysis of contemporary
   American TV series production, with a focus on how knowledge about
   political and social issues is produced and used in the TV industry. I
   identify four major expertise providers-the state, social movements,
   research organizations, and independent experts-and build a macro model
   of expertise exchange in the field of Hollywood TV. I argue that
   expertise in Hollywood is a form of capital which Hollywood
   professionals exchange for symbolic capital within the industry and in
   the field of power; it is also a form of capital that agents of the
   state, social movements, and research organizations exchange for
   symbolic capital in the field of power; and finally, independent experts
   trade their knowledge to accumulate economic and symbolic capital within
   the industry. This model is based on the analysis of data I collected
   during fieldwork in Los Angeles over 10 months in 2017-2019, which
   includes 159 interviews, 7 observation sessions, and archival materials.

DI 10.1111/1468-4446.12773
EA JUL 2020
PY 2020
AB This article points out that the way the biblical myth of the Fall has
   been interpreted in the Judeo-Christian tradition is a crucial heuristic
   in the works of Max Weber, an assessment that hitherto largely remained
   unnoticed. Nevertheless, Weber's understanding of everyday action is
   closely related to the various religious interpretations of what
   deprivations were suffered by humanity as a consequence of Adam's
   original sin and the paradisiacal yearning for salvation it engenders.
   Moreover, Weber's interpretation of the Fall is characteristic for his
   tragic sociology in the sense that it guarantees the freedom to
   subjectively create self-conscious meaning that is, however, no longer
   embedded in a context of common knowledge. His solution to this
   epistemological problem involves a Nietzschean heroic existentialism
   whereby individuals give personality to one's character by freely
   choosing their own values. Yet, he also realizes that many will not be
   able to choose by themselves and, therefore, will be attracted by
   charismatic leaders that can invoke a paradisiacal community of choice.
   Weber's modern antinomical interpretation of the Fall is still relevant
   today because it provides insight in the epistemological underpinnings
   of the contemporary populist Zeitgeist.

AB Do social networks matter for the adoption of new forms of political
   participation? We develop a formal model showing that the quality of
   communication that takes place in social networks is central to
   understanding whether a community will adopt forms of political
   participation where benefits are uncertain and where there are positive
   externalities associated with participation. Early adopters may
   exaggerate benefits, leading others to discount information about the
   technology's value. Thus, peer effects are likely to emerge only when
   informal institutions support truthful communication. We collect social
   network data for 16 Ugandan villages where an innovative mobile-based
   reporting platform was introduced. Consistent with our model, we find
   variation across villages in the extent of peer effects on technology
   adoption, as well as evidence supporting additional observable
   implications. Impediments to social diffusion may help explain the
   varied uptake of new and increasingly common political communication
   technologies around the world.

AB I examine the influence of partisan donors on the district-level
   ideological polarization of congressional candidates in the United
   States. I use data from 2002-10 U.S. House elections, which provide for
   the placement of major party primary winners on the same ideological
   dimension as their primary, general election, and partisan donor
   constituencies. Using this unique data set, I find strong evidence that
   the influence of donors in nominating contests is a source of
   polarization in the United States. House nominees are more responsive to
   their donor constituencies than either their primary or general
   electorates. I also find some evidence that the lack of general election
   competition affects nominee extremity. In safer districts, Democratic
   incumbents appear more responsive to donors. However, Republican donors
   seem to demand proximity regardless of district competitiveness.
   Overall, the polarizing effects of donor constituencies dominate any
   moderating effects, resulting in ideologically extreme nominees and,
   ultimately, members of Congress.

AB Contrary to the expectations of secularization theory, religion remains
   socially important and affects politics in multiple ways-especially
   regarding conflict between religious communities. Theoretically,
   religion can increase altruism, but belief in the superiority of one's
   faith may facilitate intergroup discrimination and related conflict.
   Previous findings remain inconclusive, however, as specific religious
   ideas have hardly been tested. In this article, we argue that the
   content of religious ideas has causal effects on intergroup
   discrimination. We hence test the impact of two opposing, prominent
   religious ideas on altruism and discrimination: universal love and the
   notion of one true religion. Conducting dictator games with Christians
   and Muslims in Ghana and Tanzania, we find causal effects: Whereas the
   idea of one true religion increases intergroup discrimination, that of
   universal love fosters equal treatment. The policy implications hereof
   are obvious-promoting tolerant religious ideas seems crucial to avoiding
   conflict.

AB Liberal and republican political theorists have not paid much attention
   to a theory of public administration or policy implementation. To the
   extent that they have, they have tended to endorse an ideal-typical
   Weberian model of bureaucracy and impersonal ethics of rules to limit
   street-level discretion. This article argues that the Weberian
   bureaucratic ethics is inconsistent with core liberal and republican
   values and, in fact, dominating at the street level. In order for laws
   and policies to be implemented in a manner consistent with liberal and
   republican principles, an alternative public ethics is proposed-a public
   ethics of care. Building on earlier research, this article argues that a
   public ethics of care represents an important supplement to liberal and
   republican ideals, as well as a better alternative to Weberian
   bureaucratic ethics, for implementing laws and policies at the street
   level in limited and responsive, nondominating ways.

   understandings of religion can best advance now by building on the
   empirical findings that have emerged under the banner of "lived
   religion," but grounding that work in theories of social practice. Going
   beyond the Western, individualist focus of recent research, the approach
   explicated in this article details a multidimensional lens for the study
   of the practices themselves and an outline of the types of historical
   and legal cultural repertoires that shape practice around the world.
   Together these frameworks can facilitate sociological research on

AB The concept of values is currently enjoying renewed interest in
   sociology; indeed, many claim that it must be treated as central to any
   theory of action. As introduced to American sociology from Europe by
   Parsons, it was transformed from a condition of possibility into an
   intrinsic element of the action system that could link abstract cultural
   imperatives to patterns of concrete behavior. When Parsons's system
   dissolved, the notion of values fractured, some scholars treating values
   as abstract imperatives and others as behavior patterns, but they
   foundered on issues of the separation of validity and existence.
   Subtracting the notion of validity from values returns us to the concept
   of interests, dyadic relations between actors and objects characterized
   by intention, attention, and extension-in other words, investment of
   self. This notion of interests lacks the explanatory instability
   characteristic of that of values. Recasting discussions of values in
   terms of interests can clarify issues central to our discipline.

AB The origins of the armed warfare between rebel alliances that spread
   across China in the late 1960s have long been obscure. This historical
   puzzle poses two distinct but interrelated questions: first, how and why
   did rebel factions form, and second, why did armed warfare follow? The
   authors develop a theory of political orientations as a product of
   contingent interactions among rebel groups and military units after the
   collapse of local governments and derive testable implications for the
   emergence of factional conflict across regions and over time. The
   authors then extend the theory to link levels of violence to the
   duration of time that conflicts remained unresolved in localities under
   military control, implying that violence intensified over time as the
   anticipated costs of defeat escalated. Both implications are tested with
   a national data set of 17,319 political events extracted from 2,246 city

   face high internal and external trade costs. I quantify the model with
   new data on crop prices, yields, and land allocations. I then measure
   the effects of changes to trade opportunities. A policy of paving roads
   raises aggregate productivity (4.9%) and the median farmer's welfare
   (2.7%), but increased competition from remote suppliers harms 20% of
   farmers. An increase in international grain prices spreads unevenly
   across regions, benefiting farmers but hurting urban consumers close to
   ports.

AB Almost half of missing women in India are of postreproductive ages. Can
   intrahousehold gender inequality and asymmetry in poverty explain a
   portion of these missing women? Using a natural experiment, I link
   women's intrahousehold bargaining power to their mortality risk. Using a
   structural household model, I estimate the age profile of women's
   bargaining power and construct women's relative poverty rates. I find
   that women's bargaining power declines with age, with older women's
   poverty rates closely matching their mortality rates by age. This
   suggests that many missing women might be accounted for by measuring
   poverty at the individual rather than the household level.

AB A principal decides when to exercise a real option. A biased agent
   influences this decision by strategically disclosing information.
   Committing to disclose all information with a delay is the optimal way
   to persuade the principal to wait. Without dynamic commitment, this
   promise is credible only if the agent's bias is small; otherwise, he
   pipets information, probabilistically delaying the principal's action.
   When the agent is biased toward early exercise, his lack of commitment
   to remain quiet leads to immediate disclosure, hurting him. Our model
   applies to pharmaceutical companies conducting clinical trials to
   influence the Food and Drug Administration or equipment manufacturers
   testing their products.

AB Do states experience more peace under female leadership? We examine this
   question in the context of Europe over the fifteenth to twentieth
   centuries. We use gender of the firstborn and presence of a sister among
   previous monarchs as instruments for queenly rule. We find that polities
   led by queens engaged in war more than polities led by kings. While
   single queens were more likely to be attacked than single kings, married
   queens were more likely to attack than married kings. These results
   suggest asymmetries in the division of labor: married queens were more
   inclined to enlist their spouses in helping them rule, which enabled
   them ultimately to pursue more aggressive war policies.

AB Policy makers have time-inconsistent preferences if they fear losing
   power or are endowed with hyperbolic discount factors. Politicians may
   thus seek to influence future policy choices, for example, by investing
   in green technologies that motivate later politicians to act
   sustainably. I show that optimal investment subsidies are larger for
   technologies that are strategic complements to future investments, that
   are further upstream in the supply chain, or that are characterized by
   longer maturity. Time inconsistency can rationalize subsidies at similar
   levels as market failures such as externalities can. Furthermore, the
   two are superadditive: time inconsistency and strategic investments are
   especially important for long-term policies associated with
   externalities.

   compare children who, at 3-4 years old, were randomized into either a
   full-time preschool, a parenting program, or a control group. We
   returned to the children when they reached 6-8 years of age and
   conducted a series of incentivized experiments to elicit their social
   preferences. We find that early-childhood education has a strong causal
   impact on social preferences. Our findings highlight the importance of

AB In many settings, decision makers' behavior is observed to vary on the
   basis of seemingly arbitrary factors. Such framing effects cast doubt on
   the welfare conclusions drawn from revealed-preference analysis. We
   relax the assumptions underlying that approach to accommodate settings
   in which framing effects are present. Plausible restrictions of varying
   strength permit either partial or point identification of preferences
   for the decision makers who choose consistently across frames.
   Recovering population preferences requires understanding the empirical
   relationship between decision makers' preferences and their sensitivity
   to the frame. We develop tools for studying this relationship and
   illustrate them with data on automatic enrollment into pension plans.

   attention model where we abstain from any particular attention formation
   and instead consider a large class of nonparametric random attention
   rules. Our intuitive condition, monotonic attention, captures the idea
   that each consideration set competes for the decision maker's attention.
   We then develop a revealed preference theory and obtain testable
   implications. We propose econometric methods for identification,
   estimation, and inference for the revealed preferences. Finally, we
   provide a general-purpose software implementation of our estimation and

AB Scholars, pundits, and political reformers have long worried that
   corporations distort public policy and subvert the will of the
   electorate by donating to politicians. Well-publicized anecdotes
   notwithstanding, whether and how much corporations actually benefit from
   supporting political candidates remains unknown. To systematically
   address this question, we utilize two complementary empirical approaches
   that isolate the monetary benefits a company derives from a favored
   candidate winning office. First, we use a regression discontinuity
   design exploiting close congressional, gubernatorial, and state

AB What citizens think about Muslim immigrants has important implications
   for some of the most pressing challenges facing Western democracies. To
   advance contemporary understanding of what 'Islamophobia' really is -
   for example, whether it is a dislike based on immigrants' ethnic
   background, religious identity or specific religious behaviors - this
   study fielded a representative online survey experiment in the UK in
   summer 2015. The results suggest that Muslim immigrants are notper
   seviewed more negatively than Christian immigrants. Instead, the study
   finds evidence that citizens' uneasiness with Muslim immigration is
   first and foremost the result of a rejection of fundamentalist forms of
   religiosity. This suggests that common explanations, which are based on
   simple dichotomies between liberal supporters and conservative critics
   of immigration, need to be re-evaluated. While the politically left and
   culturally liberal have more positive attitudes toward immigrants than
   right-leaning individuals and conservatives, they are also far more
   critical of religious groups. The study concludes that a large part of
   the current political controversy over Muslim immigration is related to
   this double opposition: it is less about immigrants versus natives or
   even Muslim versus Christians than about political liberalism versus
   religious fundamentalism.

   affects the policy positions of mainstream parties. We do this using a
   regression discontinuity approach that allows us to causally attribute
   mainstream parties' positional changes to radical right strength
   independent of public opinion as a potential confounder. Making use of
   exogenous variation created through differences in electoral thresholds,
   we empirically demonstrate that radical right success, indeed, causally
   affects mainstream parties' positions. This is true for mainstream left
   as well as mainstream right parties. These findings make an important
   contribution to the broader literature on party competition as they
   indicate that other parties' behavior and not only public opinion plays
   a crucial role in explaining parties' policy shift.

AB While research on conspiracy theories and those who believe them has
   recently undergone a renaissance, there still exists a great deal of
   uncertainty about the measurement of conspiratorial beliefs and
   orientations, and the consequences of a conspiratorial mindset for
   expressly political attitudes and behaviors. We first demonstrate, using
   data from the 2012 American National Election Study, that beliefs in a
   variety of specific conspiracy theories are simultaneously, but
   differentially, the product of both a general tendency toward
   conspiratorial thinking and left/right political orientations. Next, we
   employ unique data including a general measure of conspiratorial
   thinking to explore the predictors of specific conspiracy beliefs. We
   find that partisan and ideological self-identifications are more
   important than any other variable in predicting 'birther' beliefs, while
   conspiratorial thinking is most important in predicting conspiracy
   beliefs about the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the 9/11
   terrorist attacks.

   political behaviors? Does it make a difference whether individuals are
   discriminated against by their peers or community members in the course
   of everyday life as opposed to political actors or institutions tasked
   with upholding democratic norms of equality and fairness? Crossing
   disciplinary boundaries, this study proposes a new theoretical
   perspective regarding the relationship between discrimination and
   political behavior. Specifically, it distinguishes between societal
   (interpersonal) and political (systematic) discrimination when examining
   the behaviors of racial and ethnic minorities in Great Britain. The
   results illustrate that although experiences of political discrimination
   may motivate individuals to take part in mainstream politics for
   substantive or expressive purposes, the same conclusion cannot
   necessarily be drawn for those who experience societal rejection. The
   principal aim of this study is to further highlight the complex and
   multidimensional nature of discrimination, and to encourage further
   analyses of how different types of discrimination may impact the civic
   and political behaviors of minority groups.

AB Previous research suggests media attention may increase support for
   populist right-wing parties, but extant evidence is mostly limited to
   proportional representation systems in which such an effect would be
   most likely. At the same time, in the United Kingdom's
   first-past-the-post system, an ongoing political and regulatory debate
   revolves around whether the media give disproportionate coverage to the
   populist right-wing UK Independence Party (UKIP). This study uses a
   mixed-methods research design to investigate the causal dynamics of UKIP
   support and media coverage as an especially valuable case. Vector
   autoregression, using monthly, aggregate time-series data from January
   2004 to April 2017, provides new evidence consistent with a model in
   which media coverage drives party support, but not vice versa. The
   article identifies key periods in which stagnating or declining support
   for UKIP is followed by increases in media coverage and subsequent
   increases in public support. The findings show that media coverage may
   drive public support for right-wing populist parties in a substantively
   non-trivial fashion that is irreducible to previous levels of public
   support, even in a national institutional environment least supportive
   of such an effect. The findings have implications for political debates
   in the UK and potentially other liberal democracies.

   evaluated more often on traits belonging to the male leader stereotype,
   and that female politicians have no such advantage. These gender
   differences are expected to be especially pronounced during non-campaign
   periods. To test these expectations, a large-scale automated content
   analysis of all Dutch national newspapers from September 2006 to
   September 2012 was conducted. The results show that male politicians
   received more media coverage on leadership traits in general, although
   the male and female leader stereotypes explain most of the variation in
   gender bias between leadership traits. These gender effects are found
   during seldom-studied routine periods but not during campaigns. As
   leadership trait coverage has electoral consequences, this
   gender-differentiated coverage likely contributes to the
   under-representation of women in politics.

   challenged by the state. Within-registrant difference-in-difference and

AB This article argues that the broad and legally enforceable protection
   that bilateral investment treaties (BITs) offer to foreign investors
   worsens the human rights practices of developing countries. BITs lock in
   initial conditions attractive to investors that are linked to vertical
   investment flows and investment and trade competition. They also
   constrain the provision of welfare benefits or basic infrastructure. The
   lock-in and constraining effects are sources of popular grievance and
   dissent in states that host foreign investment. BIT-protected investor
   rights, however, limit the ability of governments to back-down vis-a-vis
   investors, lowering the relative cost of human rights violations.
   Finally, this study suggests that democratic regimes mitigate the
   negative effect of BITs. Evidence from 113 developing countries from
   1981 to 2009 supports the hypotheses.

   preferences. Based on a novel longitudinal analysis studying the
   responsiveness of German parties to interest groups across eleven issue
   areas and seven elections from 1987 until 2009, it is shown that parties
   adjust their policy agendas in response to interest group mobilization
   and that interest groups are more successful in shaping party policy

   legitimacy for global governance may depend on the function of the
   entity it is supposed to regulate (for example, law making, policy
   making, implementation, monitoring). Two arguments are made: one
   meta-theoretical and one substantive. The meta-theoretical argument
   demonstrates the fruitfulness of adopting a 'function-sensitive
   approach' to political legitimacy to address this aspect. The
   substantive argument develops the contours of an account of political
   legitimacy by applying this approach. This account consists of five
   regulative principles, which are sensitive to, and vary in accordance
   with, different functions in global politics.

AB Drawing on evidence from the 2011 Egyptian uprising, this article
   demonstrates how the use of two social media platforms - Facebook and
   Twitter - contributed to a discrete mobilizational outcome: the staging
   of a successful first protest in a revolutionary cascade, referred to
   here as 'first-mover mobilization'. Specifically, it argues that these
   two platforms facilitated the staging of a large, nationwide and
   seemingly leaderless protest on 25 January 2011, which signaled to
   hesitant but sympathetic Egyptians that a revolution might be in the
   making. It draws on qualitative and quantitative evidence, including
   interviews, social media data and surveys, to analyze three mechanisms
   that linked these platforms to the success of the January 25 protest:
   (1) protester recruitment, (2) protest planning and coordination, and
   (3) live updating about protest logistics. The article not only
   contributes to debates about the role of the Internet in the Arab Spring
   and other recent waves of mobilization, but also demonstrates how
   scholarship on the Internet in politics might move toward making more
   discrete, empirically grounded causal claims.

AB Why do citizens choose to comply in democracies, even when coercion is

   communities, such as the nation, can instill an ethical obligation to
   the collective welfare, even in the absence of formal rules. I argue
   that when the identities of one's nation and the state are seen as
   closely linked, this national obligation is politicized towards the
   state and motivates a sense of citizen duty to comply. Through
   statistical modeling and a pair of experiments in South Korea versus
   Taiwan - two otherwise similar democracies that contrast in nation-state
   linkage - I show that this ethical pathway is likely real and highly
   contextual. The findings help us better understand the varied bases of

AB How are defense co-operation and economic co-operation related? To
   answer this question, this article analyzes the coevolution of defense
   co-operation agreements (DCAs) and government-to-government loans. It
   argues that governments pursue two distinct sets of interests. At
   thebilateral level,governments use issue linkages and side payments to
   encourage spillover from defense co-operation to economic co-operation,
   and vice versa. That is, governments' bilateral interests in DCAs and
   loans are largely complementary. However, at thenetwork level,interests
   may diverge. Specifically, governments use DCAs to build clubs of
   like-minded defense collaborators or 'security communities', while they
   use loans to impose asymmetric forms of political authority or
   'hierarchies'. In some contexts, these network-level interests are, like
   bilateral interests, complementary. For example, defense partners rely
   on loans to co-ordinate their foreign policies and better respond to
   security threats, and debtors rely on lending patterns to identify
   suitable defense partners. In other cases, however, these interests
   strongly conflict. For example, governments that are highly active in
   the loan network are especially likely to rely on asymmetric exercises
   of political authority, which is incompatible with the network-level
   goal of using DCAs to establish communities of defense collaborators.
   Similarly, governments that are highly active in the DCA network are,
   due to their complex multilateral political commitments, less vulnerable
   to the asymmetric influences that loans enable. To empirically test
   these claims, the study develops a longitudinal model of multiplex
   network coevolution. Overall, the results show that while economic and
   defense co-operation often reinforce one another, they sometimes
   conflict in unexpected ways.

AB Under what conditions does peacekeeping reduce one-sided violence in

   particularly ethnic geography, affect peacekeeping effectiveness.
   Existing studies focus on the features of individual missions, yet
   curbing one-sided violence also depends on peacekeepers' capacity to
   reduce the opportunities and incentives for violence. Moving from the
   idea that territorial control is a function of ethnic polarization, the
   article posits that peacekeepers are less effective against one-sided
   violence where power asymmetries are large (low polarization) because
   they (1) create incentives for escalation against civilians and (2) are
   less effective at separating/monitoring combatants. The UN mission in
   Sierra Leone from 1997 to 2001 is examined to show that UN troops reduce
   one-sided violence, but their effectiveness decreases as power
   asymmetries grow.

AB Empirical applications of the spatial theory of elections typically rely
   on the discrete choice framework to arrive at probabilistic voting
   models. Whereas in the classic model voter choice is solely a function
   of spatial proximity, neo-Downsian models also incorporate
   voter-specific nonpolicy attributes, which are represented by
   sociodemographic characteristics. One prominent line of such
   probabilistic models, Schofield's Valence Model, additionally includes
   party valences into voter utility functions. The model rests on the
   estimated party intercepts to measure the valence advantages
   empirically. The party intercepts are ordered based on their values, and
   then this valence ranking is used further to predict equilibrium
   locations. The paper demonstrates that this measurement strategy does
   not provide unique results in fully specified models due to central
   properties of discrete choice models and the specific nature of party
   intercepts in these models. Drawing on a simple example based on mass
   election surveys from Germany, it is shown that the valence ranking, the
   crucial factor to investigate how valence differences affect the nature
   of spatial competition, is highly sensitive to arbitrary coding
   decisions. As a consequence, it is impossible to represent valence with
   the constants and to infer something substantial from the resulting
   valence ranking.

AB The use of cluster robust standard errors (CRSE) is common as data are
   often collected from units, such as cities, states or countries, with
   multiple observations per unit. There is considerable discussion of how
   best to estimate standard errors and confidence intervals when using
   CRSE (Harden 2011; Imbens and Kolesar 2016; MacKinnon and Webb 2017;
   Esarey and Menger 2019). Extensive simulations in this literature and
   here show that CRSE seriously underestimate coefficient standard errors
   and their associated confidence intervals, particularly with a small
   number of clusters and when there is little within cluster variation in
   the explanatory variables. These same simulations show that a method
   developed here provides more reliable estimates of coefficient standard
   errors. They underestimate confidence intervals for tests of individual
   and sets of coefficients in extreme conditions, but by far less than do
   CRSE. Simulations also show that this method produces more accurate
   standard error and confidence interval estimates than bootstrapping,
   which is often recommended as an alternative to CRSE.

AB Information about the ideological positions of different political
   actors is crucial in answering questions regarding political
   representation, polarization, and voting behavior. One way to obtain
   such information is to ask survey respondents to place actors on a
   common ideological scale, but, unfortunately, respondents typically
   display a set of biases when performing such placements. Key among these
   are rationalization bias and differential item functioning (DIF). While
   Aldrich-McKelvey (AM) scaling offers a useful solution to DIF, it
   ignores the issue of rationalization bias, and this study presents Monte
   Carlo simulations demonstrating that AM-type models thus can give
   inaccurate results. As a response to this challenge, this study develops
   an alternative Bayesian scaling approach, which simultaneously estimates
   DIF and rationalization bias, and therefore performs better when the
   latter bias is present.

AB Electoral boundaries are an integral part of election administration.
   District boundaries delineate which legislative election voters are
   eligible to participate in, and precinct boundaries identify, in many
   localities, where voters cast in-person ballots on Election Day.
   Election officials are tasked with resolving a tremendously large number
   of intersections of registered voters with overlapping electoral
   boundaries. Any large-scale data project is susceptible to errors, and
   this task is no exception. In two recent close elections, these errors
   were consequential to the outcome. To address this problem, we describe
   a method to audit the assignment of registered voters to districts. We
   apply the methodology to Florida's voter registration file to identify
   thousands of registered voters assigned to the wrong state House
   district, many of which local election officials have verified and
   rectified. We discuss how election officials can best use this technique
   to detect registered voters assigned to the wrong electoral boundary.

AB After seeking a "manageable standard" to apply to claims of partisan
   gerrymandering for over three decades, the Supreme Court has finally
   given up the chase, ruling that such claims are nonjusticiable. What is
   to be done? An extended history of successful congressional action
   suggests that the legislative pathway is more practical than often
   believed. Statutory requirements also make it possible to consider a
   broader suite of districting objectives. This paper presents a flexible
   new software and a framework for evaluating the practical implications
   of explicit objectives. I apply this approach to the conditions last
   required by Congress, generating equipopulous, contiguous, and compact
   districts. Among these conditions, the formal definition of compactness
   has proven contentious. Does it matter? I contrast the representation of
   the political parties and of racial and ethnic minorities under plans
   optimized according to 18 different definitions of compactness. On these
   grounds, the definitions are markedly consistent. These methods may be
   extended to alternative districting objectives and criteria.

AB Political scientists often wish to classify documents based on their

   or whether documents describe a Militarized Interstate Dispute. Simple
   classifiers often serve well in these tasks. However, if words occurring
   early in a document alter the meaning of words occurring later in the
   document, using a more complicated model that can incorporate these
   time-dependent relationships can increase classification accuracy. Long
   short-term memory (LSTM) models are a type of neural network model
   designed to work with data that contains time dependencies. We
   investigate the conditions under which these models are useful for
   political science text classification tasks with applications to Chinese
   social media posts as well as US newspaper articles. We also provide
   guidance for the use of LSTM models.

   provide a new statistical model of distinctiveness that extends
   traditional efforts to statistically characterize the "style" of authors
   and apply it to a corpus of Hansard speeches from 1935 to 2018. In the
   aggregate, we find no evidence for the claim of more homogeneity. But
   this hides intriguing covariate effects: at the MP-level, panel
   regression results demonstrate that on average, more senior backbenchers
   tend to be less "different" in speech terms. We also show, however, that
   this pattern is changing: in recent times, it is more experienced MPs
   who speak most distinctively.

AB Instrumental-variable (IV) estimation is an essential method for applied
   researchers across the social and behavioral sciences who analyze
   randomized control trials marred by noncompliance or leverage partially
   exogenous treatment variation in observational studies. The potential
   outcome framework is a popular model to motivate the assumptions
   underlying the identification of the local average treatment effect
   (LATE) and to stratify the sample into compliers, always-takers, and
   never-takers. However, applied research has thus far paid little
   attention to the characteristics of compliers and noncompliers. Yet,
   profiling compliers and noncompliers is necessary to understand what
   subpopulation the researcher is making inferences about and an important
   first step in evaluating the external validity (or lack thereof) of the
   LATE estimated for compliers. In this letter, we discuss the assumptions
   necessary for profiling, which are weaker than the assumptions necessary
   for identifying the LATE if the instrument is randomly assigned. We
   introduce a simple and general method to characterize compliers,
   always-takers, and never-takers in terms of their covariates and provide
   easy-to-use software in R and STATA that implements our estimator. We
   hope that our method and software facilitate the profiling of compliers
   and noncompliers as a standard practice accompanying any IV analysis.

AB Scholars and political observers point to declining labor unions, on the
   one hand, and rising white identity politics, on the other, as profound
   changes in American politics. However, there has been little attention
   given to the potential feedback between these forces. In this article,
   we investigate the role of union membership in shaping white racial
   attitudes. We draw upon research in history and American political
   development to generate a theory of interracial labor politics, in which
   union membership reduces racial resentment. Cross-sectional analyses
   consistently show that white union members have lower racial resentment
   and greater support for policies that benefit African Americans. More
   importantly, our panel analysis suggests that gaining union membership
   between 2010 and 2016 reduced racial resentment among white workers. The
   findings highlight the important role of labor unions in mass politics
   and, more broadly, the importance of organizational membership for
   political attitudes and behavior.

EA JUN 2020
PY 2020
AB In recent years, trust has been conceptualized as an important source of
   social capital, setting off cross-disciplinary research on both the
   benefits and predictors of trust at the individual and contextual level.
   In this paper, we turn to the individual outcomes of living in a
   trustful context, and explore the relationship between trust, itself one
   of the main components of social capital, and social support, seen as
   one of the most important effects of social capital. In particular, we
   ask how social capital-and the relationship between trust and social
   support-functions in the context of unequal societies. We model
   perceived support as an outcome across three levels, from no support to
   proximate to distal support, and using a cross-national study of Roma
   and non-Roma across 12 European countries, we track the relationship
   between trust and support across both mainstream and marginalized
   populations. Our findings suggest that living in contexts with more
   trust has protective effects particularly for members of marginalized
   groups: the Roma are more likely to have distal support in contexts with
   higher trust. We conclude that contextual trust helps to broaden the
   circle of support beyond family and friends; thus, trust can indeed be a
   synthetic force that binds individuals together in broadened structures
   of support.

AB Low-level military operations outside of war are pervasive in the
   international system. These activities have been viewed as destabilizing
   by both academics and policy makers, as miscalculations or missteps in
   conducting low-level operations can risk escalation to war. I show the
   opposite can be true: these operations can prevent escalation to a
   greater war. I examine a type of low-level conflict that I call
   "hassling" in the common framework of bargaining and war. The critical
   feature of hassling is that it weakens a targeted state. I find that
   when a rising power rules out peaceful bargains, hassling the rising
   power can prevent a preventive war, with efficiency gains for the
   involved states. This intuition is formalized in a dynamic model of
   conflict and is explored through examinations of Israel's Operation
   Outside the Box (2007), the United States' involvement in Iraq
   (1991-2003), and Russia's operations in Ukraine (beginning in 2014).

AB Precarious work in the United States is defined by economic and temporal
   dimensions. A large literature documents the extent of low wages and
   limited fringe benefits, but research has only recently examined the
   prevalence and consequences of unstable and unpredictable work
   schedules. Yet practices such as on-call shifts, last minute
   cancellations, and insufficient work hours are common in the retail and
   food-service sectors. Little research has examined racial/ethnic
   inequality in this temporal dimension of job quality, yet precarious
   scheduling practices may be a significant, if mostly hidden, site for
   racial/ethnic inequality, because scheduling practices differ
   significantly between firms and because front-line managers have
   substantial discretion in scheduling. We draw on innovative matched
   employer-employee data from The Shift Project to estimate racial/ethnic
   gaps in these temporal dimensions of job quality and to examine the
   contribution of firm-level sorting and intra-organizational dynamics to
   these gaps. We find significant racial/ethnic gaps in exposure to
   precarious scheduling that disadvantage non-white workers. We provide
   novel evidence that both firm segregation and racial discordance between
   workers and managers play significant roles in explaining racial/ethnic
   gaps in job quality. Notably, we find that racial/ethnic gaps are larger
   for women than for men.

PY 2020
AB Campaign finance contributions may influence policy by affecting
   elections or influencing the choices of politicians once in office. To
   study the trade-offs between these two paths to influence, we use a game
   in which contributions may affect electoral outcomes and signal
   policy-relevant information to politicians. In the model, a campaign
   donor and two politicians each possess private information correlated
   with a policy-relevant state of the world. The donor may allocate his or
   her budget to either an ally candidate who has relatively similar
   preferences or a moderate candidate whose preferences are relatively
   divergent from the donor's preferred policy. Contributions that increase
   the likelihood of the moderate being elected can signal good news about
   the donor's preferred policy and influence the moderate's policy choice.
   However, when the electoral effect of contributions is too small to
   demand sufficiently high costs to deter imitation by groups with
   negative information, this informational effect breaks down.

AB Do partisan disagreements over politically relevant facts, and

   find that partisan cheerleading inflates divides in factual information,

   information search; these divides are no different from those that occur
   outside the survey context when we examine web-browsing data from the

AB This article responds empirically to the question posed by Stan Cohen
   about "why, when faced by knowledge of others' suffering and
   pain-particularly the suffering and pain resulting from what are called
   'human rights violations'-does 'reaction' so often take the form of
   denial, avoidance, passivity, indifference, rationalisation or
   collusion?". Our context is Mexico's "war on drugs." Since 2006 this
   "war" has claimed the lives of around 240,000 Mexican citizens and
   disappeared around 60,000 others. Perpetrators include organized
   criminal gangs and state security services. Violence is pervasive and
   widely reported. Most people are at risk. Our study is based on
   qualitative interviews and focus groups involving 68 "ordinary Mexicans"
   living in five different Mexican cities which have varying levels of
   violence. It investigates participant proximity to the victims and the
   psychological defense mechanisms they deploy to cope with proximity to
   the violence. We found that 62 of our participants knew, directly or
   indirectly, one or more people who had been affected. We also found one
   dominant rationalization (defense mechanism) for the violence: that the
   victims were "involved in something" (drugs or organized crime) and
   therefore "deserved their fate." This echoes prevailing state discourses
   about the violence. We argue that the discourse of "involved" is a
   discourse of denial that plays three prominent roles in a highly violent
   society in which almost no-one is immune: it masks state violence,
   stigmatizes the victims, and sanctions bystander passivity. As such, we
   show how official and individual denial converge, live, and reproduce,
   and play a powerful role in the perpetuation of violence.

AB This article introduces a new explanation for why citizens may fail to
   vote based on government performance. We argue that when politicians
   have limited capacity to control bureaucrats, citizens will not know
   whether government performance is a good signal of the incumbent's
   quality. We develop a selection model of elections in which policy is
   jointly determined by a politician and a bureaucrat. When politicians
   have incomplete power over policy, elections perform worse at separating
   good and bad types of incumbents. We test the theory's predictions using
   survey experiments conducted with nearly 9,000 citizens and local
   officials in Uganda. We find that citizens and officials allocate more
   responsibility to politicians when they are perceived as having more
   power relative to bureaucrats. The allocation of responsibility has
   electoral consequences: When respondents believe that bureaucrats are
   responsible for performance, they are less likely to expect that
   government performance will affect incumbent vote share.

AB Access to formal financial products like savings accounts constitutes a
   hallmark feature of economic development, but individuals do not
   uniformly embrace these products. In explaining such financial
   preferences, scholars have focused on institutional, cultural, and
   material factors, but they have paid less attention to organizations and
   small groups. In this article, we argue that these factors are crucial
   to understanding financial preferences. We investigate a
   government-sponsored microsavings program in Colombia and find that
   participants became less interested in banking services over the course
   of the program, even as they gained access to appropriate accounts and
   their savings increased. Turning to qualitative data to understand this
   curious finding, we show that organizational efforts to disseminate
   abstract information about banking triggered a process of "elaboration"
   among group members, leading many to develop financial preferences at
   odds with those promoted by the government. This study integrates
   insights from economic sociology, organizational theory, and
   microsociology to advance theories of financial preference. In doing so,
   we reveal how organizational efforts to compress information, followed
   by group efforts to personalize and expand upon the information, can
   shape preferences and potentially undermine organizational goals.

AB Models of population-wide cultural change tend to invoke one of two
   broad models of individual change. One approach theorizes people
   actively updating their beliefs and behaviors in the face of new
   information. The other argues that, following early socialization
   experiences, dispositions are stable. We formalize these two models,
   elaborate empirical implications of each, and derive a simple combined
   model for comparing them using panel data. We test this model on 183
   attitude and behavior items from the 2006 to 2014 rotating panels of the
   General Social Survey. The pattern of results is complex but more
   consistent with the settled dispositions model than with the active
   updating model. Most of the observed change in the GSS appears to be
   short-term attitude change or measurement error rather than persisting
   changes. When persistent change occurs, it is somewhat more likely to
   occur in younger people and for public behaviors and beliefs about
   high-profile issues than for private attitudes. We argue that we need
   both models in our theory of cultural evolution but that we need more
   research on the circumstances under which each is more likely to apply.

AB Despite widespread feeling that public opinion in the United States has
   become dramatically polarized along political lines, empirical support
   for such a pattern is surprisingly elusive. Reporting little evidence of
   mass polarization, previous studies assume polarization is evidenced via
   the amplification of existing political alignments. This article
   considers a different pathway: polarization occurring via social,
   cultural, and political alignments coming to encompass an increasingly
   diverse array of opinions and attitudes. The study uses 44 years of data
   from the General Social Survey representing opinions and attitudes
   across a wide array of domains as elements in an evolving belief
   network. Analyses of this network produce evidence that mass
   polarization has increased via a process of belief consolidation,
   entailing the collapse of previously cross-cutting alignments, thus
   creating increasingly broad and encompassing clusters organized around
   cohesive packages of beliefs. Further, the increasing salience of
   political ideology and partisanship only partly explains this trend. The
   structure of U.S. opinion has shifted in ways suggesting troubling
   implications for proponents of political and social pluralism.

EA JUN 2020
PY 2020
AB The "hearts and minds" model of combating rebellions holds that
   civilians are less likely to support violent opposition groups if the
   government provides public services and security. Building on this
   model, we argue that a political event that raises popular expectations
   of future public service and security provision increases support for
   the government and decreases sympathy for violent opposition groups. To
   test this argument, we leverage a unique research design opportunity
   that stems from the unforeseen announcement of the resignation of Iraq's
   divisive prime minister in August 2014 while an original survey was
   being administered across the country. We show that the leadership
   transition led Iraq's displeased Sunni Arab minority to shift support
   from the violent opposition to the government. In line with our
   argument, this realignment was due to rising optimism among Sunni Arabs
   that the new government would provide services and public
   goods-specifically security, electricity, and jobs.

AB Existing explanations of human rights abuses emphasize a strategic logic

   to repress because of the misaligned bureaucratic incentives of state

   incentives, we study the responses of state agents working within the

AB Although researchers generally agree that national family policies play
   a role in shaping mothers' employment, there is considerable debate
   about whether, how, and why policy effects vary across country contexts
   and within countries by mothers' educational attainment. We hypothesize
   that family policies interact with national levels of earnings
   inequality to differentially affect mothers' employment outcomes by
   educational attainment. We develop hypotheses about the two most
   commonly studied family policies-early childhood education and care
   (ECEC) and paid parental leave. We test these hypotheses by establishing
   a novel linkage between the EU-Labour Force Survey and the Current
   Population Survey 1999 to 2016 (n = 23 countries, 299 country-years, 1.2
   million mothers of young children), combined with an original collection
   of country-year indicators. Using multilevel models, we find that ECEC
   spending is associated with a greater likelihood of maternal employment,
   but the association is strongest for non-college-educated mothers in
   high-inequality settings. The length of paid parental leave over six
   months is generally associated with a lower likelihood of maternal
   employment, but the association is most pronounced for mothers in
   high-inequality settings. We call for greater attention to the role of
   earnings inequality in shaping mothers' employment and conditioning
   policy effects.

   Supervisors vary widely in how they rate subordinates of similar

   supervisors can differ in their ability to manage subordinates or in
   their leniency when rating subordinates. Furthermore, firms might or

   trends for identification. Applied to confidential employment data over

   little difference in outcomes during an expansion. A multiarea,

AB We develop a model of gross capital flows and analyze their role in

   a country experiences asset fire sales, foreign investments exit
   (fickleness), while domestic investments abroad return home
   (retrenchment). When countries have symmetric expected returns and
   financial development, the benefits of retrenchment dominate the costs
   of fickleness and gross flows increase fire-sale prices. Fickleness,
   however, creates a coordination problem since it encourages local policy
   makers to restrict capital inflows. When countries are asymmetric,
   capital flows are driven by additional mechanisms-reach for safety and
   reach for yield-that can destabilize the receiving country.

AB For many products, platforms enable sellers to transact with buyers. We
   show that the competitive conditions among sellers shape the market
   structure in platform industries. If product market competition is
   tough, sellers avoid competitors by joining different platforms. This
   allows platforms to sustain high fees and explains why, for example, in
   some online markets, several homogeneous platforms segment the market.
   Instead, if product market competition is soft, agglomeration on a
   single platform emerges, and platforms fight for the dominant position.
   These insights give rise to novel predictions. For instance, market
   concentration and fees are negatively correlated in platform industries,
   which inverts the standard logic of competition.

AB Drawing from theory on the "co-production" of science and society, this
   paper provides an account of trajectories in US climatology, roughly
   from the 1850s to 1920, the period during which climatology emerged as
   an organized branch of meteorology and government administration. The
   historical narrative traces the development of climatology both as a
   professional/institutional project and as a component of a larger
   governmental logic. Historical analysis of climatologists' scientific
   texts, maps, and social organization within government provides a
   sociological explanation for the emergent "stabilization" of climate as
   a geographic-statistical category. Climatic stability, defined by the
   view that climate is unchanging, was advanced over this period in a way
   that linked the interests and practices of climatologists to actors
   invested in facilitating and administrating commercial agriculture and
   trade. I position the logic of climatology and the discourse of climatic
   stability historically, with reference to prior concern with climate
   change and, in recent decades, efforts to govern global warming through
   geoengineering climatic stability.

AB To what extent do early experiences in the host country shape the

   neighborhoods immigrants settle in establish patterns of behavior that
   influence subsequent political participation. Using Norwegian
   administrative register data, we leverage quasi-exogenous variation in
   the placement of refugees to assess the consequences of assignment to
   particular neighborhoods. We find that the difference in turnout between
   refugees initially placed in 20th and 80th percentile neighborhoods is
   12.6 percentage points, which represents 47% of the participation gap
   between refugees and residents. To assess the mechanism, we draw on
   individual-level data on all neighbors present at the time of each
   refugee's arrival and then evaluate the relative impact of neighborhood
   characteristics and available social networks. Our findings suggest that
   while neighborhood socioeconomic factors play a limited role, early
   exposure to politically engaged neighbors and peer cohorts increases
   immigrants' turnout over the long run.

AB We put forward a new approach to studying issue definition within the

   the process by which policymaking in one government affects policymaking
   in other governments-have focused on policy adoptions. We shift the
   focus to an important but neglected aspect of this process: the
   issue-definition stage. We use topic models to estimate how policies are
   framed during this stage and how these frames are predicted by prior
   policy adoptions. Focusing on smoking restriction in U.S. states, our
   analysis draws upon an original data set of over 52,000 paragraphs from
   newspapers covering 49 states between 1996 and 2013. We find that frames
   regarding the policy's concrete implications are predicted by prior
   adoptions in other states, whereas frames regarding its normative
   justifications are not. Our approach and findings open the way for a new
   perspective to studying policy diffusion in many different areas.

AB Central to the study of Congress is the study of relationships among
   members. Electoral collaboration is a function of a member's position in
   the broader congressional power network. It allows members to leverage
   their campaign resources to achieve the four classic goals of members of
   Congress: reelection, making good public policy, obtaining power within
   the institution, and having one's party in the majority. Using nearly
   3.2 million FEC records from 2010 to 2016, we explore the dynamics that
   influence electoral collaboration. We find members are most likely to
   collaborate electorally with other members from the same state, party,
   and committee, and the most electorally vulnerable. Further, party
   leaders share most frequently with the rank and file. These findings
   build upon our expanding understanding of congressional collaboration,
   the networks members of Congress form, and the congressional power
   structure members operate within.

TI Does Economic Inequality Drive Voters' Disagreement about Party
   Placement?
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE

EA MAY 2020
PY 2020
AB Does economic inequality warp voters' views about party platforms? If
   so, are voters' perceptual biases systemically shaped by their economic
   status? Drawing from a psychological theory of class conflict, we argue
   that income inequality heightens disagreement about party positions
   among people with different economic status. Analyzing survey responses
   on perceived ideological positions of 700 + parties in over 110
   elections, we reveal that poorer and richer voters systematically
   misperceive the positions of parties in opposite directions, and that
   the extent to which they do so is larger in more unequal societies. We
   also show that class-based perceptual disagreement is particularly
   salient among left- and right-leaning parties, but not among centrist
   parties. Our findings question a fundamental principle of representative
   democracy, suggesting that even a basic consensus on the ideological
   placements of parties cannot be taken for granted in highly unequal
   societies.

AB Autism is one of the twenty-first century's most contested illnesses.
   Early controversies around vaccine harm have irrevocably structured the
   field of autism science. Despite incredible investment in genetic
   research on autism over the past 30 years, scientists have failed to
   identify a set of "genes for" autism, and genomic causality has become
   more complex. Yet, orthodox genetic explanations for autism have
   retained dominance over a vociferous field of heterodox experts pointing
   to a series of environmental insults (vaccines, heavy metal exposure,
   overuse of antibiotics, toxic pollution) as the main causes of autism.
   To make sense of this puzzling trend, we develop a novel theoretical
   synthesis combining a Bourdieusian field analysis with a Gramscian
   conception of hegemony, centered around the concept of "subsumptive
   orthodoxy." Analyzing multiple years of archival data from the
   Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, we argue that when faced with
   heterodox challenges, dominant members of the field shore up hegemony by
   incorporating environmental causal factors into the genome, thus
   engaging in subsumptive orthodoxy. This move gives rhetorical space to
   environmental explanations without providing them substantive causal
   weight, which renders particular environmental causes (like vaccines)
   impossible. This article traces the strategies dominant members of the
   field use to retain control over the definition and etiology of autism.
   We develop the broader implications of the study within autism science
   and beyond.

EA MAY 2020
PY 2020
AB How does engagement with markets affect socioeconomic values and
   political preferences? A long line of thinkers has debated the nature
   and direction of such effects, but claims are difficult to assess
   empirically because market engagement is endogenous. We designed a large
   field experiment to evaluate the impact of financial markets, which have
   grown dramatically in recent decades. Participants from a national
   sample in England received substantial sums they could invest over a
   6-week period. We assigned them into several treatments designed to
   distinguish between different theoretical channels of influence. Results
   show that investment in stocks led to a more right-leaning outlook on
   issues such as merit and deservingness, personal responsibility, and
   equality. Subjects also shifted to the right on policy questions. These
   results appear to be driven by growing familiarity with, and decreasing
   distrust of markets. The spread of financial markets thus has important
   and underappreciated political ramifications.

EA MAY 2020
PY 2020
AB Modern states are distinguished by the breadth and depth of public
   regulation over private affairs. This aspect of state capacity and state
   power is predicated on frequent and dense encounters between the state
   and the population it seeks to control. We argue that literacy in the
   language of state administration facilitates state-society interaction
   by lowering the transaction costs of those encounters. We support this
   claim with evidence drawing upon detailed historical data from
   nineteenth-century France during a crucial period of state and nation
   building. Focusing on the specific domain of French marriage
   regulations, we find that increasing literacy predicts greater popular
   involvement with local authorities across French regions over time.
   These results demonstrate that literacy plays an important role in
   political development not solely by enhancing loyalty to the state, as
   the literature has recognized, but also by lowering linguistic and human
   capital barriers to state-society interaction.

AB Which firms oppose action to fight climate change? Networks of input

   reinforce opposition to decarbonization beyond direct emitters of CO2.
   To test this claim, we build the largest data set of public political
   activity for and against climate action in the United States, revealing
   that the majority of corporate opposition to climate action comes from
   outside the highest-emitting industries. We construct new measures of
   the carbon intensity of firms and show that policy exposure via
   carbon-intensive inputs and sales to downstream emitters explains this
   large volume of opposition from non-emitting industries. Sixty-six
   percent of U.S. lobbying on climate policy has been conducted by an
   extended coalition of firms, associations, and other groups that have
   publicly opposed reducing carbon emissions. Public opposition to climate
   action by carbon-connected industries is therefore broad-based, highly

AB Adult children's labor market status and their type of marriage are
   major channels through which family advantages are passed from one
   generation to the next. However, these two routes are seldom studied
   together. We develop a theoretical approach to incorporate marriage
   entry and marital sorting into the intergenerational transmission of
   family income, accounting for differences between sons and daughters and
   considering education as a central explanatory factor. Using a novel
   decomposition method applied to data from the Panel Study of Income
   Dynamics, we find that marriage plays a major role in intergenerational
   transmission only among daughters and not until they reach their
   late-30s. This is more salient in the recent cohort in our data (people
   born 1963 to 1975). Marital status and marital sorting are comparably
   important in accounting for the role of marriage, but sorting becomes
   more important over cohorts. The increasing earnings returns to
   education over a husband's career and the weakening association between
   parental income and daughter's own earnings explain why marital sorting,
   and marriage overall, have been growing more important for
   intergenerational transmission from parents to their daughters.

EA MAY 2020
PY 2020
AB Why do political leaders travel abroad? In this article, we propose an
   informational mechanism linking in-person diplomacy to leader survival.
   A foreign power visits an incumbent in order to reap a future policy
   concession; the visit is only worth the effort if the incumbent remains
   in power long enough to deliver on the deal. A diplomatic visit thus
   provides a visible and credible signal of the visitor's high confidence
   in the incumbent's stability in office. Domestic opponents, facing
   incomplete information as to the incumbent's strength, observe the
   signal and are deterred from mounting a challenge. Using data on U.S.
   diplomatic visits from 1960 to 2013, we find strong empirical support
   for our predictions: A visit with the U.S. president substantially
   reduces the risk of a leader's removal from office.

AB Important work has been done to measure legislative effectiveness in the

   it. Much less attention, however, has been devoted to study the extent
   to which legislative effectiveness depends on the legislators' social
   connections. We address this issue with a new model of legislative
   effectiveness that formalizes the role of social connections, and we
   test its predictions using the network of cosponsorship links in the
   109th-113th Congresses. We propose a new empirical strategy that
   addresses network endogeneity by implementing a two-step Heckman
   correction based on an original instrument: the legislators' alumni
   connections. We find that social connections are a significant
   determinant of legislative effectiveness. We also study the influence of
   legislators' characteristics in shaping the network effects. In doing
   so, we provide new insights into how social connectedness interacts with
   factors such as seniority, partisanship, and legislative leadership in
   determining legislators' effectiveness.

AB We document the evolution of market power based on firm-level data for
   the U.S. economy since 1955. We measure both markups and profitability.
   In 1980, aggregate markups start to rise from 21% above marginal cost to
   61% now. The increase is driven mainly by the upper tail of the markup
   distribution: the upper percentiles have increased sharply. Quite
   strikingly, the median is unchanged. In addition to the fattening upper
   tail of the markup distribution, there is reallocation of market share
   from low- to high-markup firms. This rise occurs mostly within industry.
   We also find an increase in the average profit rate from 1% to 8%.
   Although there is also an increase in overhead costs, the markup
   increase is in excess of overhead. We discuss the macroeconomic
   implications of an increase in average market power, which can account
   for a number of secular trends in the past four decades, most notably
   the declining labor and capital shares as well as the decrease in labor
   market dynamism.

AB In popular accounts, stories of environmental refugees convey a bleak
   picture of the impacts of climate change on migration. Scholarly
   research is less conclusive, with studies finding varying effects. This
   article uses an agent-based model (ABM) of land use, social networks,
   and household dynamics to examine how extreme floods and droughts affect
   migration in Northeast Thailand. The ABM explicitly models the dynamic
   and interactive pathways through which climate-migration relationships
   might operate, including coupled out and return streams. Results suggest
   minimal effects on out-migration but marked negative effects on return.
   Social networks play a pivotal role in producing these patterns. In all,
   the portrait of climate change and migration painted by focusing only on
   environmental refugees is too simple. Climate change operates on already
   established migration processes that are part and parcel of the life
   course, embedded in dynamic social networks, and incorporated in larger
   interactive systems where out-migration and return migration are
   integrally connected.

AB Much literature on peer influence has relied on central tendency-based
   approaches to examine the role of peer groups. This article develops a
   distributional framework that (1) differentiates between the influence
   of depressive peers and that of a majority group of nondepressive peers;
   and (2) considers the multilayered nature of peer environments. The
   authors investigate which segments of the distribution of peer
   depressive symptoms drive peer effects on adolescent depression across
   different layers of peer groups. Results from the Add Health data show
   that, for institutionally imposed peer groups, exposure to depressive
   peers significantly increases adolescents' depressive symptoms. For
   self-selected peer groups, the central tendency of peer depression
   largely captures its impact on adolescent depression. High parent-child
   attachment buffers the deleterious consequence of exposure to depressive
   grademates. The implications of these findings are discussed for
   research and policy regarding peer effects on adolescent well-being.

   distinct relational dynamics: apatronage dynamiccharacterized by
   exclusive and long-lasting relationships between a council member and
   his/her local constituency and apartnership dynamiccharacterized by
   citywide relationships that are short-lived and fostered by

AB It is known that greater social cohesion increases a group's ability to
   enforce cooperation. Despite this, defectors often go unpunished, and
   groups with social structures that are a priori favorable often fail. A
   critical distinction is required between the structural effect on
   ability versus willingness to punish. The authors develop a theoretical
   framework in which variation in a group's social structure generates a
   tension between ability and willingness to enforce cooperation.
   Structures that promote ability to punish also often reduce interest in
   carrying out sanctions, thus changing collective outcomes. The authors'
   empirical analysis involves a well-defined cooperative dilemma: group
   lending in Sierra Leone. They complement statistical modeling, based on
   a data set containing 5,487 group repayments, with ethnographic
   analysis. They find that (1) structural cohesion only increases economic
   cooperation between borrowers to a point, beyond which unwillingness
   outweighs increased ability to punish, reducing group repayments, and
   that (2) groups with disconnected subgroups perform worse on average.
   Although borrowers are more willing to punish defectors in the
   out-subgroup, they are unable to do so effectively.

AB International financial integration helps to diversify risk but also may
   spread crises across countries. We provide a quantitative analysis of
   this trade-off in a two-country general equilibrium model with
   collateral-constrained borrowing using a global solution method.
   Borrowing constraints bind occasionally, depending upon the state of the
   economy and levels of inherited debt. We examine different degrees of
   international financial integration, moving from financial autarky, to
   bond and equity market integration. Financial integration leads to a
   significant increase in global leverage, substantially escalates the
   probability of crises for any one country, and dramatically increases
   the degree of "contagion" across countries. Outside of crises, the
   impact of financial integration on macroeconomic aggregates is
   relatively small. But the impact of a crisis with integrated
   international financial markets is much less severe than that under
   financial market autarky. Thus, a trade-off emerges between the
   probability of crises and the severity of crises. Using a large
   cross-country database of financial crises in developing and developed
   economies over a forty-year period, we find evidence in support of the
   model.

AB Academics, criminal justice professionals, and news outlets have warned
   that gang-associated youth use social media to taunt rivals and trade
   insults in ways that cause offline retaliation. But there is
   surprisingly little empirical research investigating how gang-associated
   youth deploy social media in gang conflicts. Criminal justice
   professionals routinely overstate the violent effects of social media
   challenges, which further exacerbates criminalization, racial
   stereotyping, and social inequality. Drawing from two years of
   ethnographic fieldwork on Chicago's South Side, this study asks how
   gang-associated black youth use social media to challenge rivals.
   Bridging traditional theories of urban violence with emerging media
   scholarship, I argue that social media disrupt the key impression
   management practices associated with the "code of the street."
   Specifically, gang-associated youth exploit social media to publicly
   invalidate the authenticity of their rivals' performances of toughness,
   strength, and street masculinity. Challengers do so through "cross
   referencing," "calling bluffs," and "catching lacking." Each strategy
   differs in its likelihood to catalyze physical retaliation, which is a
   function of the amount and depth of counter-evidence necessary to refute
   a given challenge. These findings carry important implications for
   addressing urban violence, gangs, and inequality in the social media
   age.

AB People with a criminal record face substantial demand-side employment
   barriers that have clear implications for whether or not they search for
   work and what strategies they use. We know relatively little, however,
   about whether and how penal contact affects patterns of job search and
   how search patterns affect search success. Using the 2001-2011 waves of
   the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97),
   we find that penal contact and penal dispositions-arrest, conviction,
   and incarceration-reduce odds of job search, decrease the number of
   search methods job seekers deploy, and direct job seekers away from
   search methods that are generally more efficient and effective at
   yielding offers. Further, altered search patterns contribute
   significantly to post-contact job seekers' lower odds of search success,
   especially for blacks. Taken together, our findings suggest that job
   search engagement is another key mechanism linking penal contact and
   poorer job search outcomes.

AB Based on 17 months of ethnographic fieldwork and 45 in-depth interviews
   with formerly-incarcerated men, this article explores how former
   prisoners navigate criminal justice and welfare bureaucracies in their
   daily lives. Formerly-incarcerated men must repeatedly engage with
   parole, public assistance agencies, transitional housing facilities, and
   community-based service providers to maintain freedom and access food,
   shelter, and rehabilitative services. Accessing resources requires the
   men simultaneously to manage multiple, overlapping entanglements across
   a fragmented network of bureaucracies. This runaround exacerbates the
   stress of poverty, breeds distrust of state authorities, and, in some
   cases, precipitates recidivism. Former prisoners learned how to cope
   with the runaround by treating systems navigation as a full-time
   occupation, but these skills did not translate into long-term economic
   security. Most study participants recurrently cycled between low-wage
   jobs, transitional housing facilities, and public assistance programs
   for years after release. This article illustrates the need to theorize
   prisoner reentry as a process that unfolds across a network of criminal
   justice and welfare bureaucracies and demonstrates how
   formerly-incarcerated men experience citizenship not only through
   coercive encounters with the criminal justice system but also through
   their simultaneous entanglements with safety-net bureaucracies.

AB The development of the feminist anti-domestic violence movement in the
   United States illustrates the trajectory from a social movement field
   devoid of carceral involvement to one fully occupied by the agents of
   crime control. Countering a narrative that often begins with the
   Violence against Women Act of 1994, this study demonstrates how the
   roots of carceral feminism extend back to the movement's first decade
   from 1973 to 1983. This study analyzes data from 60 social movement
   leaders. The pluralist coalition resulting from a successful lawsuit
   against the Oakland Police Department, the creation of the victim
   witness program in San Francisco, and the development of the Community
   Coordinated Response in Duluth, Minnesota, represent mechanisms of
   engagement with law enforcement tied to innovative organizational forms.
   The process called the "carceral creep" describes how early social
   movement successes against an initially unresponsive criminal justice
   system evolved into collaborative relationships that altered the
   autonomy and constitution of initial social movement organizations. The
   creation of new organizational forms and their replication contributed
   to today's carceral feminism. These developments were accompanied by
   persisting gender, race, and class tropes used to justify
   pro-criminalization strategies and obfuscate impacts on marginalized
   communities.

AB Although criminal-legal interventions became accepted as the best
   response to domestic violence early in the battered women's movement,
   recent literature suggests that such interventions are often ineffective
   in reducing rates of violence. Despite this evidence, domestic violence
   advocates still emphasize criminal-legal interventions over alternatives
   when working with victims of violence. The author spent thirteen months
   observing domestic violence advocates in a feminist nonprofit
   organization to learn how the paradoxical reliance on criminal-legal
   interventions is reproduced. The paper identifies three mechanisms.
   First, information on criminal-legal interventions is emphasized more
   than other interventions in advocate training. Second, nonprofit staff
   present extreme examples of abuse and their associated criminal-legal
   interventions while training advocates rather than describing the types
   of abuse more typically brought to the organization. Finally, staff
   establish protocols for handling advocates' discontent with
   criminal-legal interventions which makes further collaboration between
   volunteers and the police possible. Together, these mechanisms reproduce
   criminal-legal interventions by limiting advocates' knowledge of the
   variety of alternative interventions. Practically, this work suggests
   several ways for advocates to destabilize ineffective organizational
   practices. Theoretically, the author shows that normative institutions
   are reproduced not just through socialization and coercion, but also
   through a lack of alternatives.

AB We coin the term "racialized equity labor" to describe the often
   uncompensated efforts of people of color to address systematic racism
   and racial marginalization within organizations. Using a year-long
   ethnographic and interview study of a majority-minority public
   university, we focus specifically on the racialized equity labor of
   college students who, like many faculty and staff of color, often labor
   to make their campuses comfortable and functional for historically
   underrepresented populations. We identify a cycle of racialized labor
   appropriation whereby: 1) people of color identify problems in the
   racial environment of their organizations and work to solve them; 2)
   leadership responds by blocking efforts and/or denying issues; 3)
   external and/or internal pressures force introspection and push leaders
   to resolve an organizational threat (e.g., to the university's public
   image of diversity); and finally, 4) leadership appropriates racialized
   equity labor, and in doing so converts it into a diluted diversity
   initiative. Those engaged in racialized equity labor may resist
   appropriation, but the cycle takes a toll on activists. The ways in
   which organizations respond to racialized equity labor offers insight
   into the reproduction of racial inequities, despite the hard work of
   people of color to create meaningful racial change.

AB Legacy of slavery research has branched out into an important new niche
   in social science research by making empirical connections between the
   trans-Atlantic slave trade and contemporary social outcomes. However,
   the vast majority of this research examines black-white inequality or
   black disadvantage without devoting corresponding attention to the other
   side of inequality: white advantage. This study expands the legacy of
   slavery conversation by exploring whether white populations accrue
   long-term benefits from slave labor. Specifically, I deploy historical
   understandings of racial boundary formation and theories of durable
   inequality to argue that white populations in places that relied more
   heavily on slave labor should experience better social and economic
   outcomes than white population in places that relied less on slave
   labor. I test this argument using OLS regression and county-level data
   from the 1860 United States Census, the 2010-2014 American Community
   Survey (ACS), and the 2014 United States Department of Agriculture
   Economic Research Service (USDA ERS). The results support my hypothesis.
   Historical reliance on slave labor predicts better white outcomes on
   five of six metrics. I discuss the implications of these findings for
   race, slavery, whiteness studies, and reparations.

AB The crisis of neoliberalism and the upsurge of populist politics have
   renewed interest in how contemporary economic elites justify their
   privileged position, trying to be "moral" and "rich" in an era of
   increasing inequality and an anti-elite climate. We addressed this
   question through an ethnographic analysis of the socio-cultural life of
   the heirs of the Israeli economic elite and of the boundary-making
   processes that philanthropy allows them as they face internal and
   external challenges. Adopting analytical tools from a cultural process
   approach to inequality and a contextual approach to elite distinction,
   we suggest that the heirs generate distinct social and symbolic position
   within a changing field of power by presenting themselves as an "elite
   without elitism." This is accomplished through a mutually reinforcing

AB Revisiting the Egyptian Uprising of 2011, I argue that strong relational
   networks linking actors in the broader Cairo-based political
   opposition-a conglomerate of prodemocracy movement organizations-should
   be understood as a necessary, albeit insufficient, causal condition for
   the diffusion of protest. These networks fulfilled two essential
   functions. 1) They were critical in terms of professionally socializing
   a new generation of activists-many of whom would become early riser
   participants during the initial protests on January 25, 2011. 2) The
   networks allowed for critically important coordination of and
   mobilization for the protests as they cut across boundaries of
   individual social and protest movement organizations. Based on 55
   semi-structured interviews, I trace the genesis of these relational
   networks during the first decade of the new millennium, showing how a
   coalition of actors sought to capitalize on a transnational
   demonstration effect triggered by the Tunisian Revolution. This
   group-linked by dense relational networks-then functioned as early
   risers during the initial stages of the uprising and encouraged other
   segments of Egyptian society to join the protests and to openly
   challenge a regime that had often been regarded as impenetrable to
   popular demands for socio-political change from below.

AB The role of emotions in social movements and mobilization has been an
   important focus of recent research, but the emotional mechanisms
   producing apathy and non-participation remain under studied. This
   article explores the thinking and feeling processes involved in the
   production of apolitical attitudes, paying particular attention to their
   social and cultural context. Cultural norms of appropriateness and
   emotional expression can hinder or boost the emotions involved in the
   mobilizing processes. Based on 60 interviews with young people in two
   Russian cities, collected during and in the aftermath of the anti-regime
   protests of 2011-12, I explore the apathy syndrome-a combination of
   emotional mechanisms and cultural norms that produce political apathy.
   Personal frustrating experiences develop into long-term cynicism and
   disbelief in the efficacy of collective action, a process exacerbated by
   the transmission of apathy in families and educational institutions, as
   well as by cultural norms of appropriate emotions. Cultural cliches and
   dissociation from others help people cope with the trap and justify
   inaction.

AB The private home is a crucial site in the aging process, yet the upkeep
   of this physical space often poses a challenge for community-dwelling
   older adults. Previous efforts to explain variation in disorderly
   household conditions have relied on individual-level characteristics,
   but ecological perspectives propose that home environments are
   inescapably nested within the dynamic socioeconomic circumstances of
   surrounding spatial contexts, such as the metro area. We address this
   ecological embeddedness in the context of the Great Recession, an event
   in which some U.S. cities saw pronounced and persistent declines across
   multiple economic indicators while other areas rebounded more rapidly.
   Panel data (2005-6 and 2010-11) from a national survey of older adults
   were linked to interviewer home evaluations and city-level economic
   data. Results from fixed-effects regression support the hypothesis that
   older adults dwelling in struggling cities experienced an uptick in
   disorderly household conditions. Findings emphasize the importance of
   city-specificity when probing effects of a downturn. Observing changes
   in home upkeep also underscores the myriad ways in which a city's most
   vulnerable residents- older adults, in particular-are affected by its
   economic fortunes.

AB Treatment for depression is complex, requiring decisions that may
   involve trade-offs between exploiting treatments with the highest
   expected value and experimenting with treatments with higher possible
   payoffs. Using patient claims data, we show that among skilled doctors,
   using a broader portfolio of drugs predicts better patient outcomes,
   except in cases where doctors' decisions violate loose professional
   guidelines. We introduce a behavioral model of decision making guided by
   our empirical observations. The model's novel feature is that the
   trade-off between exploitation and experimentation depends on the
   doctor's diagnostic skill. The model predicts that higher diagnostic
   skill leads to greater diversity in drug choice and better matching of
   drugs to patients even among doctors with the same initial beliefs
   regarding drug effectiveness. Consistent with the finding that guideline
   violations predict poorer patient outcomes, simulations of the model
   suggest that increasing the number of possible drug choices can lower
   performance.

AB We study how aggregate economic conditions affect the timing of
   marriage, and particularly child marriage, in Sub-Saharan Africa and in
   India. In both regions, substantial monetary or in-kind transfers occur
   with marriage: bride price across Sub-Saharan Africa and dowry in India.
   In a simple equilibrium model of the marriage market in which parents
   choose when their children marry, income shocks affect the age of
   marriage because marriage payments are a source of consumption
   smoothing, particularly for a woman's family. As predicted by our model,
   we show that droughts, which reduce annual crop yields by 10 to 15% and
   aggregate income by 4 to 5%, have opposite effects on the marriage
   behavior of a sample of 400,000 women in the two regions: in Sub-Saharan
   Africa they increase the annual hazard into child marriage by 3%, while
   in India droughts reduce such a hazard by 4%. Changes in the age of
   marriage due to droughts are associated with changes in fertility,
   especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, and with declines in observed marriage
   payments. Our results indicate that the age of marriage responds to
   short-term changes in aggregate economic conditions and that marriage
   payments determine the sign of this response. This suggests that, in
   order to design successful policies to combat child marriage and improve
   investments in daughters' human capital, it is crucial to understand the
   economic role of marriage market institutions.

AB Liver exchange has been practiced in small numbers, mainly to overcome
   blood-type incompatibility between patients and their living donors. A
   donor can donate either his smaller left lobe or the larger right lobe,
   although the former option is safer. Despite its elevated risk,
   right-lobe transplantation is often utilized due to size-compatibility
   requirement with the patient. We model liver exchange as a market-design
   problem, focusing on logistically simpler two-way exchanges, and
   introduce an individually rational, Pareto-efficient, and
   incentive-compatible mechanism. Construction of this mechanism requires
   novel technical tools regarding bilateral exchanges under
   partial-order-induced preferences. Through simulations we show that not
   only can liver exchange increase the number of transplants by more than
   30%, it can also increase the share of the safer left-lobe transplants.

AB It is well understood that classical sample selection models are not
   semiparametrically identified without exclusion restrictions. Lee (2009)
   developed bounds for the parameters in a model that nests the
   semiparametric sample selection model. These bounds can be wide. In this
   paper, we investigate bounds that impose the full structure of a sample
   selection model with errors that are independent of the explanatory
   variables but have unknown distribution. The additional structure can
   significantly reduce the identified set for the parameters of interest.
   Specifically, we construct the identified set for the parameter vector
   of interest. It is a one-dimensional line segment in the parameter
   space, and we demonstrate that this line segment can be short in
   practice. We show that the identified set is sharp when the model is
   correct and empty when there exist no parameter values that make the
   sample selection model consistent with the data. We also provide
   non-sharp bounds under the assumption that the model is correct. These
   are easier to compute and associated with lower statistical uncertainty
   than the sharp bounds. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our approach
   by estimating a standard sample selection model for wages.

   accumulation on-the-job. We establish which components of the model can
   be non-parametrically identified and which ones cannot. We estimate the
   model and use it to assess the relative contribution of the different
   factors for overall wage inequality. We find that variation in premarket
   skills (the key feature of the Roy model) is the most important
   component to account for the majority of wage variation. We also
   demonstrate that there is substantial interaction between the other
   components, most notably, that the importance of the job match obtained
   by search frictions varies from around 4% to around 29%, depending on
   how we account for other components. Inequality due to preferences for
   non-pecuniary aspects of the job (which leads to compensating
   differentials) and search are both very important for explaining other
   features of the data. Search is important for turnover, but so are
   preferences for non-pecuniary aspects of jobs as one-third of all
   choices between two jobs would have resulted in a different outcome if

AB In this paper, we study how occupation (or industry) tradability shapes
   local labor-market adjustment to immigration. Theoretically, we derive a
   simple condition under which the arrival of foreign-born labor into a
   region crowds native-born workers out of (or into) immigrant-intensive
   jobs, thus lowering (or raising) relative wages in these occupations,
   and we explain why this process differs within tradable versus within
   nontradable activities. Using data for U.S. commuting zones over the
   period 1980-2012, we find-consistent with our theory-that a local influx
   of immigrants crowds out employment of native-born workers in more
   relative to less immigrant-intensive nontradable jobs, but has no such
   effect across tradable occupations. Further analysis of occupation labor
   payments is consistent with adjustment to immigration within tradables
   occurring more through changes in output (versus changes in prices) when
   compared to adjustment within nontradables, thereby confirming our
   model's theoretical mechanism. We then use the model to explore the
   quantitative consequences of counterfactual changes in U.S. immigration
   on real wages at the occupation and region level.

   polarization is driven by divergence in the ideologies of politicians?
   How much is instead the result of changes in the capacity of parties to
   control their members? We use detailed internal information on party
   discipline in the context of the U.S. Congress-whip count data for
   1977-1986-to identify and structurally estimate an economic model of
   legislative activity in which agenda selection, party discipline, and
   member votes are endogenous. The model delivers estimates of the
   ideological preferences of politicians, the extent of party control, and
   allows us to assess the effects of polarization through agenda setting
   (i.e., which alternatives to a status quo are strategically pursued). We
   find that parties account for approximately 40% of the political
   polarization in legislative voting over this time period, a critical
   inflection point in U.S. polarization. We also show that, absent party
   control, historically significant economic policies would have not
   passed or lost substantial support. Counterfactual exercises establish
   that party control is highly relevant for the probability of success of
   a given bill and that polarization in ideological preferences is more
   consequential for policy selection, resulting in different bills being
   pursued.

AB Time use is both a cause of social inequality and a consequence of
   social inequality. However, how social class stratifies time use
   patterns is seldom studied. In this paper, I describe the time use
   patterns in the years 1983 and 2015 by social class, and gender in the
   British context. Using sequence analysis methods, I show how the
   diversity of time use patterns in British society is socially
   stratified. I find that 13 clusters capture the heterogeneity of time
   use patterns and that these clusters are associated with social class,
   gender, and day of the week. These clusters capture patterns of paid and
   unpaid work schedules, as well as leisure patterns. The results show
   that men have experienced a reduction of the standard Monday to Friday
   8-hr working day, while women have experienced a general increase in
   this type of schedule. On the other hand, patterns of domestic working
   days have reduced for women and increased for men. Important differences
   exist in paid and unpaid work patterns between social classes.
   Working-class women have experienced an important increase in shift work
   on weekends. They are also much more likely to be doing unpaid work on
   weekdays compared to upper-class and middle-class women. Working-class
   men are more likely to experience non-working days and leisure days on
   both weekdays and weekends and are more likely to be doing shift work.
   They are also more often doing unpaid work on weekdays compared to men
   in upper-class households. Patterns of childcare indicate that all
   families have increased their childcare time. Men in upper-class

AB Is the test result positive or negative? Tests that occur in labs and
   doctors' offices pose specific questions to try to obtain specific
   information. But what happens in the social world when these tests never
   see the inside of a lab or doctor's office, and instead they are used in
   a house, in a Walmart bathroom, or in a dormitory bathroom stall?
   Putting the diagnosis aside, what does the presence of these tests do to
   social life? This paper examines one such test, the home pregnancy test,
   and specifically, its use in contemporary intimate life of people who do
   not want to be pregnant. Pregnancy tests test for pregnancy. But what
   else is the pregnancy test putting to the test? To investigate this, I
   spent 8 years studying American pregnancy tests using a qualitative
   mixed methods approach. This paper draws on some of my research
   materials, specifically, 85 life history interviews. Each participant
   was asked to recall, in full, all of their experiences with home
   pregnancy tests throughout their lives, resulting in well over 300
   narratives of home pregnancy test usage which I qualitatively analyzed.
   I find that more than just a test for a pregnancy, the use of the home
   pregnancy test is a test of roles, relationships, and responsibilities
   in social life. These findings suggest implications for social life as
   more biomedical tests move out of the purview of the medical
   establishment.

AB In the last 20 years, the drive for evidence-based policymaking has been
   coupled with a concurrent push for the use of randomized controlled
   trials (RCTs) as the "gold-standard" for generating rigorous evidence on
   whether or not development interventions work. Drawing on content
   analysis of 63 development RCTs and 4 years of participant observation,
   I provide a rich description of the diverse set of actors and the
   transnational organizational effort required to implement development
   RCTs and maintain their "scientific status." Particularly, I investigate
   the boundary work that proponents of RCTs-also known as randomistas-do
   to differentiate the purposes and merits of testing development projects
   from doing them, as a way to bypass the political and ethical problems
   presented by adopting the experimental method with foreign aid
   beneficiaries in poor countries. Although randomistas have been mostly
   successful in differentiating RCTs from the projects evaluated, I also
   examine cases where they were not able to do so, as a means to highlight
   the controversies associated with implementing RCTs in international
   development.

AB Prior accounts of the experimenter's regress in laboratory testing are
   set against the background of a relatively stable institutional context.
   Even if the tools are new or the object of investigation is unknown,
   participating entities are named, a certain degree of funding is
   presumed, and an organization exists to conduct the test. In this paper,
   I argue that this background assumption obscures the importance of
   institutional and organizational context to the sociology of testing. I
   analyze ethnographic data gathered among a NASA team whose funding is
   uncertain, whose mission organization is not yet established, and whose
   object of investigation is inaccessible. In what I characterize as
   "ontological flexibility," I reveal how scientists shift their accounts
   of object agency in response to changes in their institutional
   environment. As they describe the moon as "uncooperative" or "multiple"
   while they make appeals to institutions at various stages of support in
   their exploration projects, this reveals the presence of an
   "institutional regress": a previously overlooked aspect of the sociology
   of testing.

AB Anyone trying to be a citizen has to pass through a set of practices
   trying to be a state. This paper investigates some of the ways testing
   practices calibrate citizens, and in doing so, perform "the state." The
   paper focuses on three forms of citizenship testing, which it considers
   exemplary forms of "state work," and which all, in various ways, concern
   "migration." First, the constitution of a "border crossing," which
   requires an identity test configured by deceptibility. Second, the Dutch
   asylum process, in which "being gay" can, in certain cases, be reason
   for being granted asylum, but where "being gay" is also the outcome of
   an examination organized by suspicion. And third, the Dutch measurement
   of immigrants' "integration," which is comprised of a testing process in
   which such factishes as "being a member of society" and "being modern"
   surface. Citizenship is analyzed in this paper as accrued and
   (re)configured along a migration trajectory that takes shape as a
   testing concours, meaning that subjects become citizens along a
   trajectory of testing practices. In contributing both to work on states
   and citizenship, and to work on testing, this paper thus puts forward
   the concept of citizenship testing as state work, where "state work is
   the term for that kind of labor that most knows itself as comparison,
   equivalency, and exchange in the social realm" (Harney, 2002, pp.
   10-11). Throughout the testing practices discussed here, comparison,
   equivalency, and exchange figure prominently as the practical
   achievements of crafting states and citizens.

AB Name-altering practices are common in many creative fields-pen names in
   literature, stage names in the performing arts, and aliases in music.
   More than just reflecting artistic habits or responding to the need for
   distinctive brands, these practices can also serve as test devices to
   probe, validate, and guide the artists' active participation in a
   cultural movement. At the same time, they constitute a powerful probe to
   negotiate the boundaries of a subculture, especially when its features
   are threatened by appropriation from the mass-oriented culture. Drawing
   evidence from electronic music, a field where name-altering practices
   proliferate, we outline dynamics of pseudonymity, polyonymy, and
   anonymity that surround the use of aliases. We argue that name-altering
   practices are both a tool that artists use to probe the creative
   environment and a device to recursively put one's creative participation
   to the test. In the context of creative subcultures, name-altering
   practices constitute a subtle but effective form of underground testing.

AB The American Dream is central to the national ethos, reflecting people's
   optimism that all who are willing to work hard can achieve a better life
   than their parents. Separate from the support for the idea of the
   American Dream itself is whether the public believes it is attainable.
   We consider the origins and dynamics of the public's belief in the
   achievability of the American Dream. Is the American Dream a symbolic
   vision, rooted in political socialization rather than contemporary
   politics? Or does optimism about the American Dream follow from the
   viability of the dream, rising with economic prosperity and falling with
   declining opportunity? We develop a new macrolevel measure of belief in
   the American Dream from 1973 to 2018. We show that it moves over time,
   responsive to changes in social mobility, income inequality, and
   economic perceptions. As inequality increases, belief in the
   attainability of the American Dream declines.

AB China's social credit system is an unusually explicit case where
   technology is used by multiple actors to turn human behavior into a test
   object on behalf of the state's goal of modifying the larger social
   environment, making it an intriguing setting for thinking about the new
   sociology of testing. This article considers how China's search for a
   usable "credit" score to both allocate financial resources and
   explicitly measure a citizen's trustworthiness creates an emergent
   experimental system of governance similar to, yet not quite captured by,
   the kinds of experimental processes observed in literature on the
   platform as a form of market-based governance. As a site where "seeing
   like a state" and "seeing like a market" converge, the social credit
   system is a vantage point for observing the changing relationship
   between moral and economic domains in an era of digital platforms. The
   article highlights the experimental quality of the system and its
   emerging system of governance structured around reward and punishment
   and argues that strategic ambiguity, institutionalized through the
   affordances of digital platforms, is an important part of the design of
   this large-scale social experiment.

AB In an age defined by computational innovation, testing seems to have
   become ubiquitous, and tests are routinely deployed as a form of
   governance, a marketing device, an instrument for political
   intervention, and an everyday practice to evaluate the self. This essay
   argues that something more radical is happening here than simply
   attempts to move tests from the laboratory into social settings. The
   challenge that a new sociology of testing must address is that
   ubiquitous testing changes the relations between science, engineering,
   and sociology: Engineering is today in the very stuff of where society
   happens. It is not that the tests of 21st-century engineering occur
   within a social context but that it is the very fabric of the social
   that is being put to the test. To understand how testing and the social
   relate today, we must investigate how testing operates on social life,
   through the modification of its settings. One way to clarify the
   difference is to say that the new forms of testing can be captured
   neither within the logic of the field test nor of the controlled
   experiment. Whereas tests once happened inside social environments,
   today's tests directly and deliberately modify the social environment.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
DI 10.1111/ajps.12523
EA APR 2020
PY 2020
AB Why do interest groups lobby allied legislators if they already agree?
   One possibility is that allies are intermediaries who help persuade
   unconvinced legislators. To study the role and value of intermediaries,
   I develop a formal model of persuasive lobbying where interest groups
   use public cheap talk and provide verifiable information to a
   strategically selected coalition of legislators. Interest groups face a
   trade-off: Lobbying aligned legislators is advantageous as they are more
   willing to endorse the group's preferred policy, but those who are too
   aligned cannot persuade a majority of their peers. The model illustrates
   how intermediaries are especially valuable if interest groups cannot
   persuade a majority themselves. Counter to previous work, the results
   demonstrate how a legislature's ideological composition determines the
   use of intermediaries. Groups may lobby intermediaries even if access to
   legislators is free and unrestricted.

TI Shame and ("managed") resentment: Emotion and entitlement among Israeli

DI 10.1111/1468-4446.12753
EA APR 2020
PY 2020
AB Of the range of negative emotional states, shame is commonly found to
   characterize experiences of people living in poverty. However,
   relatively little attention has been directed toward exploring other
   emotions that accompany the shame. Not exploring other emotions, the
   possibility that working-class mothers go through a struggling emotional
   experience in relation to their experiences of how authorities validate
   their belonging, is left out of scope. Exploring the notion of
   resentment creates a conceptual space for considering this possibility,
   as it flags the importance of belonging and entitlement for mothers
   living in poverty. I analyze these issues here, by applying
   "translocational positionality" which stresses how people take up
   positions relating to experiences of (non-) belonging and entitlement
   which are informed by struggles over inclusion and resources. As such,
   it stresses the links between struggles of belonging and struggles for
   securing access to resources. It affords the opportunity to identify the
   emotional/affectual dimension of struggles that would otherwise be
   implicit at best. A Resentment focused analysis of structured interviews
   conducted with 90 mothers, from seven ethno-national categories, living
   in poverty in Israel enabled me to analyze issues of belonging and
   entitlement as part of a continuous struggle for resources, pitched
   against welfare practices which ostensibly support mothers and families
   in need, but in fact apply means-tested and other exclusionary
   principles to leave mothers without the assistance that would protect
   them from shame.

EA APR 2020
PY 2020
AB This paper examines the role of bilateral foreign aid in supporting the
   diffusion and enactment of common models and institutions of the rule of
   law among aid-recipient low- and middle-income countries. We ask whether
   aid targeted at security-sector reform and the rule of law influences
   the adoption of constitutional and legal reforms over time
   (institutional diffusion), and whether aid also supports more effective
   implementation of the rule of law, writ large (legal reach). We use
   event history and fixed-effects panel regression models to examine a
   sample of 154 countries between 1995 and 2013 to answer these questions.
   Our findings suggest that aid does increase the likelihood of adopting
   several rule of law reforms, but its effect on increasing the depth or
   quality of rule of law over time within countries is much less
   substantial. These findings suggest that though aid may play a role in
   supporting the diffusion of models contributing to state isomorphism
   among countries, it is less effective at increasing the pervasiveness
   and quality of such model's implementation. This discrepancy between the
   effectiveness of bilateral aid in promoting law on the books versus law
   in action in aid recipient countries calls into question the current
   approach to rule of law reforms.

AB This article examines Channel "de-radicalization" interventions, which
   take place on individuals suspected of having the potential to commit
   terrorist crimes. Situated within critical security studies, the article
   explores the British Prevent programme by utilizing primary interviews
   with hard-to-reach Channel mentors and senior Prevent officials.
   Following the work of anticipatory risk-governance scholarship, this
   research illuminates the three processes of risk-visibilization (how an
   individual becomes sufficiently "seen" as harbouring risk that they are
   offered Channel mentorship), risk-calculation (how practitioners
   negotiate supposed riskiness), and risk-knowing (how practitioners
   "know" risks they observe). It demonstrates how the practice of
   preemptive counter-terrorism is subsumed inherently by-even relies
   upon-subjectivity and human prejudice, and fundamental disagreements
   between practitioners. Through substantial empirical contribution on the
   phenomenon of Channel interventions, the discussion highlights
   ultimately that the algorithmic rationale of preemptive risk-spotting
   normalizes the suspicion of banal and everyday behaviors, precisely
   because such interventions are ultimately deployed through worst-case

EA APR 2020
PY 2020
AB This article studies the consequences of digital surveillance in
   dictatorships. I first develop an informational theory of repression and
   co-optation. I argue that digital surveillance resolves dictators'
   information problem of not knowing individual citizens' true anti-regime
   sentiments. By identifying radical opponents, digital surveillance
   enables dictators to substitute targeted repression for nonexclusive
   co-optation to forestall coordinated uprisings. My theory implies that
   as digital surveillance technologies advance, we should observe a rise
   in targeted repression and a decline in universal redistribution. Using
   a difference-in-differences design that exploits temporal variation in
   digital surveillance systems among Chinese counties, I find that
   surveillance increases local governments' public security expenditure
   and arrests of political activists but decreases public goods provision.
   My theory and evidence suggest that improvements in governments'
   information make citizens worse off in dictatorships.

   policies have the intended equalizing effect on family and gender
   differences in economic outcomes. This article compares how the
   combination of family events across the life course is associated with
   annual and accumulated earnings at mid-life for men and women in an
   egalitarian Nordic welfare state. Based on Finnish register data (N =
   12,951), we identify seven typical family life courses from ages 18 to
   39 and link them to mid-life earnings using sequence and cluster
   analysis and regression methods. Earnings are highest for the most
   normative family life courses that combine stable marriage with two or
   more children for men and women. Mid-life earnings are lowest for
   unpartnered mothers and never-partnered childless men. Earnings gaps by
   family lives are small among women but sizeable among men. Gender
   disparities in earnings are remarkably high, particularly between men
   and women with normative family lives. These gaps between married
   mothers and married fathers remain invisible when looking only at
   motherhood penalties. Results further highlight a large group of
   (almost) never-partnered childless men with low earnings who went
   largely unnoticed in previous research.

AB A wide body of research over the past 30 years links non-standard work
   schedules to increased work-family conflict (WFC), but often only within
   single country contexts. A relatively under-explored question is the
   extent to which the effects of non-standard schedules on family life
   might vary by country or be buffered by institutional context. Building
   on past research, this study uses multilevel modelling techniques on
   2004 and 2010 European Social Survey data to explore whether the effects
   of non-standard schedules on WFC vary across 32 countries in Europe, and
   if so, whether this contextual variation can be explained by labour
   regulations and industrial relations characteristics measured at the
   country level. Findings show that while non-standard work hours and days
   are associated with increased WFC across the majority of sampled
   countries, the strength of this association varies significantly between
   countries. The strongest factor shaping the social consequences of
   non-standard schedules is the degree to which workers are covered under
   collective bargaining agreements in a country, which explains as much as
   17% of the observed between-country variation in the effects of
   non-standard schedules on WFC. These findings highlight collective
   agreements as one of the central mechanisms through which
   family-friendly regulations on working times and conditions are
   generated for non-standard schedule workers across Europe. More broadly,
   findings suggest that when studying the social consequences of
   non-standard schedules, these arrangements must be contextualized in the
   broader institutional frameworks within which they are organized and
   regulated.

AB In this study, we analyse the sharp rise in poverty among working-age
   singles and single parents in Sweden. In a dual-earner society like
   Sweden, we show that the return of mass unemployment in combination with
   the retreat of a generous and inclusive welfare state have substantially
   increased the poverty risks of single-adult households, who cannot rely
   on the income buffering effect of the family. Whereas cutbacks to
   unemployment benefits have been detrimental for the relative income
   position of single-adult households, the poverty risks of couples with
   and without children are much less affected. Individual-level
   characteristics of the poor persons themselves provide little
   explanatory leverage for why trends in poverty diverge by family form.
   Our results raise a number of issues of relevance for the wider academic
   debate about the capacity of the welfare state to adequately respond to
   both old and new social risk groups.

AB y With the advance of the gender revolution, income dynamics in couples
   are changing. Nonetheless, in most Western societies, parenthood still
   promotes specialized gender roles. Utilizing Norwegian register data on
   all married and cohabiting couples born 1946-1989, we investigate
   possible changes in the associations between parenthood and
   within-couple inequality in earnings in the years 2005-2014. Precisely,
   using interactions and fixed effects models, we compare the development
   of within-couple gender gaps in earnings over time between childless
   couples and couples with children of different ages, and within couples
   before and after childbirth. Results showed that the gender gap in
   earnings in couples increased with the number of children and was most
   distinct among couples with children below 6 years. However, the
   association between parenthood and within-couple inequality in earnings
   was reduced across the study period, a development partly driven by a
   decreasing fatherhood premium evident from 2009 onwards. Not only
   women's but also men's income development is now negatively affected by
   having young children in the household. Our findings, thus, indicate
   important changes in how men and women prioritize paid labour after a
   childbirth.

AB Wage inequality continued to increase through the 1990s and 2000s in
   post-industrial economies. This article contributes to the debate on
   occupations and inequality by assessing the role of occupational
   segregation and occupational closure for understanding the increase in
   inequality. Using employee data for West Germany in 1992 and 2012 and
   based on decompositions of unconditional quantile regressions the
   article investigates the contribution of changes in both occupational
   characteristics to changes in the wage structure. Our findings suggest
   that both the employment increase in more closed occupations and
   increased rewards in these occupations have contributed to wage
   increases across the distribution, especially in the lower half of the
   wage distribution. Our results further suggest disproportional wage
   increases in female-dominated occupations at the bottom of the
   distribution and disproportional wage decreases in male-dominated
   occupations at the top. If these occupational characteristics had
   remained at 1992 levels, then 90/10 wage inequality would have been 25
   per cent higher in 2012. Thus, changes in occupational characteristics
   have contributed to wage compression in the observation period.

   field experiment in Germany, this study examines the effects of
   parenthood on hiring processes in the prototypical conservative welfare
   state. My findings indicate that job recruitment processes indeed
   penalize women but not men for having children. In addition to providing
   theoretical explanations for why motherhood penalties in hiring are
   particularly likely to occur in the German context, this study also
   highlights several methodological and practical issues that should be

AB This article analyses the role of gender, parenthood, and work
   flexibility measures and the mediating role of stereotypes on the
   likelihood of achieving an internal promotion in Spain. We hypothesize
   that employers favour fathers over mothers and disfavour flexible
   workers (flexibility stigma) because they are perceived, respectively,
   as less competent and less committed. We also hypothesize that employers
   reflect their gender values in the selection process. These hypotheses
   are tested using data from a survey experiment in which 71 supervisors
   from private companies evaluate 426 short vignettes describing six
   different candidates for promotion into positions that require
   decision-making and team supervision skills. Several candidate
   characteristics are experimentally manipulated, while others such as
   skills and experience in the company are kept constant to minimize the
   risk of statistical discrimination. Contrary to our expectations,
   fathers are not preferred in promotion, as they are not perceived as
   being more competent than mothers. However, we find that flexibility
   leads to lower promotion scores, partly due to its association with a
   lack of commitment. Although the statutory right to reduce working hours
   for care reasons seems a major social achievement, this experiment shows
   that mothers may be indirectly penalized, as they are the main users of
   this policy.

AB y Comparing employment rates of mothers and childless women over the

   address the question of whether the parenthood effect on employment has
   declined. By following synthetic cohorts of mothers and childless women
   up to retirement age, we can study both the short-term and long-term
   consequences of having a child. We consider employment participation as
   well as working time and also perform analyses by educational level. Our
   study is based on the Austrian microcensus, conducted between 1986 and
   2016, and uses descriptive methods, logistic regression models, and
   decomposition analysis. The results show that the increase in the
   proportion of part-time work has led to a declining work volume of
   mothers with young children, despite employment rates of mothers having
   increased across cohorts. Return to the workplace is progressively
   concentrated when the child is 3-5 years old, but the parenthood effect
   has become weaker only from the time children enter school. Part-time
   employment is primarily adopted (at least with younger children) by
   highly educated mothers and often remains a long-term arrangement.

   effects of healthier individuals into a couple relationship and the

   about the accumulation of health effects over time. We apply
   fixed-effects estimation techniques to data from the German
   Socio-economic Panel. For women, mental health improves after
   establishing a non-cohabiting relationship and remains similar after
   starting cohabitation and after getting married. For men, only marriage
   improves mental health status. The impacts of couple relationships on
   physical health primarily depend on the duration of the relationship and
   slowly accumulate over time. In addition, effects are stronger for

   this type of household is a coping strategy with respect to financial
   distress for families with children. Using data from EU Statistics on
   Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), we examine three specific
   empirical questions with regards to this complex form of
   intergenerational solidarity, notably (i) we identify to what extent
   co-residence within MGHs is financially beneficial to the young and/or
   the old generation; (ii) we analyse how the income brought into these
   households by the old generation impacts on child poverty, and (iii) we
   test how sensitive this impact is to hypotheses about the way resources
   are shared in the household. We define MGHs as those households where
   three generations cohabit. The results indicate that the formation of
   MGH operates mainly as solidarity from older to younger generations.
   Although not designed for this purpose, pensions alleviate child poverty
   in countries where MGH is most prevalent.

AB What determines citizens' freedom to exit autocracies? How does this
   influence global patterns of migration and democratization? Although
   control over citizen movement has long been central to autocratic power,
   modern autocracies vary considerably in how much they restrict
   emigration. This article shows that autocrats strategically choose
   emigration policy by balancing several motives. Increasing emigration
   can stabilize regimes by selecting a more loyal population and
   attracting greater investment, trade and remittances, but exposing their
   citizens to democracy abroad is potentially dangerous. Using a
   half-century of bilateral migration data, the study calculates the level
   and destinations of expected emigration given exogenous geographic and
   socioeconomic characteristics. It finds that when citizens
   disproportionately emigrate to democracies, countries are more likely to
   democratize - and that autocrats restrict emigration freedom in
   response. In contrast, a larger expected flow of economic emigration
   predicts autocratic survival and freer emigration policy. These results
   have important implications for autocratic politics, democratic
   diffusion and the political sources of migration.

AB Analytical models of government formation typically assume

   negotiate to form governments in high-dimensional discrete issue spaces.
   We model these negotiations, leveraging the fact that different
   politicians typically attach different importance to the same issue,
   allowing gains from trade when they negotiate agreed positions on large
   packages of issues. The set of issues in an agreed package is
   endogenous; politicians need not agree on every issue before they go
   into government together, "tabling" issues on which they agree to
   disagree. We exercise our model computationally, calibrating it to 91
   real-world government formation settings, and mapping out the relative
   probability of Condorcet winning cabinets in different settings. This
   probability measures how hard it is for negotiators to find Condorcet
   winning cabinets in a giant high-dimensional state space. We test this
   claim empirically with a statistical model of the duration of
   negotiations after an election.

   matters is whether the act of delegation serves the government's

   the government's control over monetary policy, it can also improve

AB We use the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanism to estimate
   willingness to pay (WTP) for and heterogeneous impacts of clean water
   technology through a field experiment in Ghana. Although WTP is low
   relative to cost, demand is inelastic at low prices. Short-run treatment
   effects are positive throughout the WTP distribution. After 1 year, use
   and benefits are both increasing in WTP, with negative effects on
   low-WTP households. Combining estimated treatment effects with
   households' WTP implies valuations of health benefits much smaller than
   typically used by policy makers. We explore differences between BDM and
   take-it-or-leave-it valuations and make recommendations for implementing
   BDM in the field.

AB We show that genetic endowments linked to educational attainment
   strongly and robustly predict wealth at retirement. The estimated
   relationship is not fully explained by flexibly controlling for
   education and labor income. We therefore investigate a host of
   additional mechanisms that could account for the gene-wealth gradient,
   including inheritances, mortality, risk preferences, portfolio
   decisions, beliefs about the probabilities of macroeconomic events, and
   planning horizons. We provide evidence that genetic endowments related
   to human capital accumulation are associated with wealth not only
   through educational attainment and labor income but also through a
   facility with complex financial decision-making.

AB How do elites signal their superior social position via the consumption
   of culture? We address this question by drawing on 120 years of
   "recreations" data (N = 71,393) contained within Who's Who, a unique
   catalogue of the British elite. Our results reveal three historical
   phases of elite cultural distinction: first, a mode of aristocratic
   practice forged around the leisure possibilities afforded by landed
   estates, which waned significantly in the late-nineteenth century;
   second, a highbrow mode dominated by the fine arts, which increased
   sharply in the early-twentieth century before gently receding in the
   most recent birth cohorts; and, third, a contemporary mode characterized
   by the blending of highbrow pursuits with everyday forms of cultural
   participation, such as spending time with family, friends, and pets.
   These shifts reveal changes not only in the contents of elite culture
   but also in the nature of elite distinction, in particular, (1) how the
   applicability of emulation and (mis)recognition theories has changed
   over time, and (2) the emergence of a contemporary mode that publicly
   emphasizes everyday cultural practice (to accentuate ordinariness,
   authenticity, and cultural connection) while retaining many tastes that
   continue to be (mis)recognized as legitimate.

AB Science is central to the regulation of risk. But who provides the
   science on which risk regulations are based? Through an in-depth
   empirical analysis of domestic health and safety standards, this article
   shows how private actors use scientific information to acquire
   preferential outcomes. I develop a formal model delineating conditions
   under which firms will seek stricter standards on their own products,
   and I reveal how companies can acquire these outcomes through the
   strategic provision of information. To test the theory, I track changes
   to U.S. agrochemical standards over a two-decade period. I also
   introduce firm-level petition data and historical evidence to test the
   mechanism directly. My findings provide new insight into the strategies
   companies use to benefit from regulations, while also forcing us to
   reevaluate what it means for regulations to be based on science.

AB The social welfare effects of legislatures in presidential systems, such
   as the U.S. Congress, are frequently lamented. In response, there are
   proposals to reform the separation of powers system by giving presidents
   control of the legislative agenda and weakening rules such as the
   filibuster. We provide a game-theoretic analysis of the policy and
   social welfare consequences of a more executive-centric system.
   Integrating standard assumptions about legislative and executive
   incentives into a dynamic model of decision making with private
   investment, we show there are a variety of conditions under which
   stronger executives do not produce better outcomes. Moreover, we
   characterize how these conditions depend on factors such as the
   stability of the policymaking environment or investment fundamentals.
   Our findings are robust and consistent with empirical observations that
   U.S. policy outputs are not necessarily worse than those of nations with
   stronger executives, which more closely approximate prominent proposals
   by populist-oriented reformers.

AB This article examines the effect of corruption on ideological voting.
   Linking previous studies of political corruption with theories of
   ideological voting, it argues that when corruption is high, voters place
   less importance on ideology when voting than they otherwise would. The
   reason for this effect is related to voters' reduced ability to
   accurately perceive parties' positions and to their low political
   efficacy in these contexts. Using data from ninety-seven elections from
   the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, the study shows that in
   countries with high levels of corruption, voters consider ideology less
   in their voting decisions, partially because they face difficulties
   identifying parties' ideological positions and/or they do not believe
   parties can implement their electoral programmes. These relationships
   hold even after controlling for socio-economic and political confounders
   and for voters' increased likelihood of abstaining when corruption is
   high.

AB Criminal violence differs from other conflicts because illegal cartels
   primarily use violence to eliminate rivals rather than overthrow the
   state. However, politicians' ability to influence cartel behavior
   remains unclear. This article argues that politicians alter the use of
   violence by setting their jurisdiction's police enforcement levels, but
   that cartels can bribe politicians to look the other way. Because
   cartels are uncertain about politicians' corruptibility, not every bribe
   is successful. Following an election, cartels must invest resources into
   learning politicians' level of corruption. Cartels only increase their
   level of violence after successfully bribing political leaders, which
   implies that local violence levels should increase the longer parties
   remain in office. The study formalizes this argument and tests its
   implications using data on homicides and political tenure from Mexico.
   The results link incumbency to violence and suggest Mexico experiences
   an additional 948 homicides for each year of increased political tenure
   after holding an election.

   issues - such as Brexit - the potential for campaign effects was high
   for the pro-EU frames. This suggests that within an asymmetrical
   information environment - in which the arguments for one side of an

   (pro-EU) have been understated - the potential for campaign effects in a

AB The use of negative political communication is a predominant
   characteristic of modern politics. However, literature doesn't provide
   an answer to the following question: what explains fluctuations in the
   use of negative messages within political organisations during a given
   political campaign? The present paper examines this question in the
   context of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Data consists of
   all tweets distributed by the official Twitter account of both campaign
   organisations (@YesScotland and @UK_Together) between June 16, 2014 and
   September 17, 2014. Results are obtained by a non-parametric local
   regression and by time-series regression analyses. Our model
   demonstrates that having an advance in the polls had a statistically
   significant influence on the tweet sentiment of at least one
   organisation during the referendum campaign: Better Together's messages
   were more negative when it was ahead in the polls. Meanwhile, Yes
   Scotland's messages were more negative after each of the leaders'
   debates.

AB This article presents a formal model of path dependence inspired by
   England's history. The introduction of feudalism after the Norman
   Conquest - the critical juncture - created a large elite that rebelled
   frequently. The king fought these revolts with the help of collaborators
   he recruited from the masses. In compensation, he made these
   collaborators members of the elite. This was a cost-effective form of
   compensation: rents were only partly rival, and so new elite members
   only partially diluted the rents received by the king. The dilution from
   adding new members decreased as the elite grew in size, generating
   positive feedback and path dependence. This mechanism can account for
   the extension of rights in England in the early stages of its journey
   towards democracy.

AB Recent theories on the causes of war focus on how institutional and
   structural factors shape leaders' decisions in foreign policy. However,
   citizens, policy-makers, and a growing number scholars argue that
   leaders' background experiences may matter for both domestic and foreign
   policy choices. This article contributes to an emerging body of
   scholarship on leaders in international relations by showing how
   personal attributes influence the initiation of militarized disputes.
   Based on the soft power theory of international experiences and the
   impressionable-years hypothesis of socialization, I theorize that
   leaders with the experience of attending a university in a Western
   democratic country should be less likely than non-Western-educated
   leaders to initiate militarized interstate disputes. I test this
   proposition by employing a new dataset, building on Archigos and LEAD,
   that includes background attributes of more than 900 leaders from 147
   non-Western countries between 1947 and 2001. The results strongly
   support the hypothesis, even when accounting for leader selection,
   time-variant country and leader-level controls, other leaders'
   background characteristics, and country and year fixed effects. This
   finding lends credence to the soft power thesis of academic institutions
   on international sojourners, and highlights the value of considering
   leaders' experiences in analyses about international relations.

AB Latin American pension reforms during the 1990s dramatically increased
   the number of people in the region who had a direct stake in the returns

   expansion affected Latin American politics? It focuses particularly on
   popular attitudes towards neoliberalism. It argues that
   government-induced expansions of capital ownership do not directly
   affect public preferences about neoliberalism, but did so indirectly by
   shaping the information that people use to judge whether neoliberalism
   is welfare enhancing. According to this view, participation in a
   reformed Latin American pension system should lead to acceptance of
   neoliberalism when pensions returns are high, but have the opposite
   effect when returns are low. This study analyzes multiple datasets of
   Latin American survey data and finds support for this theory.

   partisan strength and sorting help drive this trend. Drawing on insights
   from moral psychology, however, we posit that partisan moral convictions
   heighten affective polarization beyond the effects of partisanship,
   increasing partisan animosity and copartisan favoritism. Testing this
   theory using data from two national samples and novel measures of
   affective polarization in everyday life, we find that people who tend to
   moralize politics display more partisan bias, distance and hostility,
   irrespective of partisan strength. These results shed light on a
   different moral divide that separates the American public and raise key
   normative questions about moral conviction and electoral politics.

   polarization, Western European political parties present clearer
   positions on an issue when it is a prime issue for them, but blur their
   positions when it is a secondary issue. Then, position blurring gives
   different implications to party systems with different degrees of issue
   dimensionality (such as American vs Western European party systems). The
   results also imply that political parties will respond to ongoing voter
   polarization on economic and immigration issues differently in the
   clarity of their position.

AB Governing elites often ratify human rights treaties, even when their
   policies do not align with those treaties' obligations. This article
   argues that this can be explained by the fact that executives anticipate
   the potential challenges these treaties could raise vis-a-vis their
   domestic policies and enter different types of reservations when they
   ratify to head them off. The types of reservations they use depend on
   key characteristics of the executive's policies and practices, as well
   as its relationship with the legislative and judicial branches. Domestic
   actors can raise different types of challenges against the executive
   depending on variations in these key factors. The types of reservations
   executives use will therefore vary depending on the specific challenges
   ratification raises for them. Using an original dataset of the
   reservations states entered on human rights treaties registered with the
   United Nations, and employing an event history analysis, this study

AB How do political rights influence immigrant integration? This study
   demonstrates that the timing of voting rights extension plays a key role
   in fostering political incorporation. In Norway, non-citizens are
   eligible to vote in local elections after three years of residency.
   Drawing on individual-level registry data and a regression discontinuity
   design, the study leverages the exogenous timing of elections relative
   to the start of residency periods to identify the effect of early access
   to political institutions. It finds that immigrants who received early
   access were more likely to participate in subsequent electoral contests,
   with the strongest effects visible among immigrants from dictatorships
   and weak democracies. It also observes evidence consistent with
   spillover effects for other aspects of political engagement. These
   findings suggest that early access to voting rights influences
   subsequent trajectories of immigrant incorporation, in particular among
   immigrants from less developed states who may otherwise face high
   integration barriers.

AB In regions plagued by reoccurring periods of war, violence and
   displacement, how does past exposure to violence affect altruism toward
   members of different ethnic or religious groups? Drawing on theories of
   empathy-driven altruism in psychology, this article proposes that
   violence can increase individuals' capacity to empathize with others,
   and that empathy born of violence can in turn motivate helping behavior
   across group boundaries. This hypothesis is tested using data on the
   hosting behavior of roughly 1,500 Liberians during the 2010-11 Ivorian
   refugee crisis in eastern Liberia, a region with a long history of
   cross-border, inter-ethnic violence. Consistent with its theoretical
   predictions, the study finds that those who experienced violence during
   the Liberian civil war host greater numbers of refugees, exhibit
   stronger preferences for distressed refugees and less bias against
   outgroup refugees, and host a higher proportion of non-coethnic,
   non-coreligious and distressed refugees. These findings suggest that
   violence does not necessarily lead to greater antagonism toward
   outgroups, as is often assumed, and that in some circumstances it can
   actually promote inter-group co-operation.

AB The process by which people transfer their allegiance from ethnic to
   national identities is highly topical yet somewhat opaque. This article
   argues that one of the key determinants of national identification is
   membership in a 'core' ethnic group, or Staatsvolk, and whether or not
   that group is in power. It uses the example of Uganda as well as
   Afrobarometer data to show that, when the core ethnic group is in power
   (as measured by the ethnic identity of the president), members of this
   group identify more with the nation, but when this group is out of power
   members identify more with their ethnic group. This finding has
   important implications for the study of nationalism, ethnicity and
   African politics.

AB In political science, data with heterogeneous units are used in many
   studies, such as those involving legislative proposals in different
   policy areas, electoral choices by different types of voters, and
   government formation in varying party systems. To disentangle
   decision-making mechanisms by units, traditional discrete choice models
   focus exclusively on the conditional mean and ignore the heterogeneous
   effects within a population. This paper proposes a conditional binary
   quantile model that goes beyond this limitation to analyze discrete
   response data with varying alternative-specific features. This model
   offers an in-depth understanding of the relationship between the
   explanatory and response variables. Compared to conditional mean-based
   models, the conditional binary quantile model relies on weak
   distributional assumptions and is more robust to distributional
   misspecification. The model also relaxes the assumption of the
   independence of irrelevant alternatives, which is often violated in
   practice. The method is applied to a range of political studies to show
   the heterogeneous effects of explanatory variables across the
   conditional distribution. Substantive interpretations from
   counterfactual scenarios are used to illustrate how the conditional
   binary quantile model captures unobserved heterogeneity, which extant
   models fail to do. The results point to the risk of averaging out the
   heterogeneous effects across units by conditional mean-based models.

AB The concept of electoral competition plays a central role in many
   subfields of political science, but no consensus exists on how to
   measure it. One key challenge is how to conceptualize and measure
   electoral competitiveness at the district level across alternative
   electoral systems. Recent efforts to meet this challenge have introduced
   general measures of competitiveness which rest on explicit calculations
   about how votes translate into seats, but also implicit assumptions
   about how effort maps into votes (and how costly effort is). We
   investigate how assumptions about the effort-to-votes mapping affect the
   units in which competitiveness is best measured, arguing in favor of
   vote-share-denominated measures and against vote-share-per-seat
   measures. Whether elections under multimember proportional
   representation systems are judged more or less competitive than
   single-member plurality or runoff elections depends directly on the
   units in which competitiveness is assessed (and hence on assumptions
   about how effort maps into votes).

AB An increasing number of studies exploit the occurrence of unexpected

   effects. In this paper, we discuss the use of this identification
   strategy based on unforeseen and salient events that split the sample of

   during Survey Design. In particular, we focus on the assumptions under
   which unexpected events can be exploited to estimate causal effects and
   we discuss potential threats to identification, paying especial
   attention to the observable and testable implications of these
   assumptions. We propose a series of best practices in the form of
   various estimation strategies and robustness checks that can be used to
   lend credibility to the causal estimates. Drawing on data from the
   European Social Survey, we illustrate the discussion of this method with
   an original study of the impact of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks
   (Paris, 01/07/2015) on French citizens' satisfaction with their national

AB Conjoint analysis is a common tool for studying political preferences.
   The method disentangles patterns in respondents' favorability toward
   complex, multidimensional objects, such as candidates or policies. Most
   conjoints rely upon a fully randomized design to generate average
   marginal component effects (AMCEs). They measure the degree to which a
   given value of a conjoint profile feature increases, or decreases,
   respondents' support for the overall profile relative to a baseline,
   averaging across all respondents and other features. While the AMCE has
   a clear causal interpretation (about the effect of features), most
   published conjoint analyses also use AMCEs to describe levels of
   favorability. This often means comparing AMCEs among respondent
   subgroups. We show that using conditional AMCEs to describe the degree
   of subgroup agreement can be misleading as regression interactions are
   sensitive to the reference category used in the analysis. This leads to
   inferences about subgroup differences in preferences that have arbitrary
   sign, size, and significance. We demonstrate the problem using examples
   drawn from published articles and provide suggestions for improved
   reporting and interpretation using marginal means and an omnibus F-test.
   Given the accelerating use of these designs in political science, we
   offer advice for best practice in analysis and presentation of results.

AB Experiments often include multiple treatments, with the primary goal to
   compare the causal effects of those treatments. This study focuses on
   comparing the causal anatomies of multiple treatments through the use of
   causal mediation analysis. It proposes a novel set of comparative causal
   mediation (CCM) estimands that compare the mediation effects of
   different treatments via a common mediator. Further, it derives the
   properties of a set of estimators for the CCM estimands and shows these
   estimators to be consistent (or conservative) under assumptions that do
   not require the absence of unobserved confounding of the
   mediator-outcome relationship, which is a strong and nonrefutable
   assumption that must typically be made for consistent estimation of
   individual causal mediation effects. To illustrate the method, the study
   presents an original application investigating whether and how the
   international legal status of a foreign policy commitment can increase
   the domestic political "audience costs" that democratic governments
   suffer for violating such a commitment. The results provide novel
   evidence that international legalization can enhance audience costs via
   multiple causal channels, including by amplifying the perceived
   immorality of violating the commitment.

AB The adage "All politics is local" in the United States is largely true.
   Of the United States' 90,106 governments, 99.9% are local governments.
   Despite variations in institutional features, descriptive
   representation, and policy-making power, political scientists have been
   slow to take advantage of these variations. One obstacle is that
   comprehensive data on local politics is often extremely difficult to
   obtain; as a result, data is unavailable or costly, hard to replicate,
   and rarely updated. We provide an alternative: crowdsourcing this data.
   We demonstrate and validate crowdsourcing data on local politics using
   two different data collection projects. We evaluate different measures
   of consensus across coders and validate the crowd's work against elite
   and professional datasets. In doing so, we show that crowdsourced data
   is both highly accurate and easy to use. In doing so, we demonstrate
   that nonexperts can be used to collect, validate, or update local data.

   procedure employs a diverse ensemble of predictive models-including
   multilevel regression, LASSO, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and
   gradient boosting-to improve the cross-validated fit of the first-stage
   predictions. In a Monte Carlo simulation, SRP significantly outperforms
   MRP when there are deep interactions in the data generating process,
   without requiring the researcher to specify a complex parametric model

AB This article aims to explain why inequality in fringe benefits has grown
   faster than wage inequality over the past four decades. We depart from
   previous income inequality research by studying benefits in addition to
   wages, but also by focusing on workplaces as the main drivers of benefit
   determination. We advance the argument that benefits determination is
   more organizationally embedded than wages mainly because workplaces have
   greater ability and incentive to alter benefits. Consequently, workplace
   compensation practices, including type of employment relations, are more
   important for benefits than for wages. Longitudinal linked employer-job
   administrative data on wages and voluntary benefits costs from the
   Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) allow us to test these
   arguments, as well as examine why benefit inequality has dramatically
   increased. Results from variance decomposition reveal that between- and
   within-establishment inequality is higher in benefits than in wages,
   indicating that workplaces affect benefits more than wages. Regression
   results show that, as expected, establishment-level pay-settings affect
   benefits more than wages, and the decline in labor unions along with the
   liberalization of employment practices partly account for why benefit
   inequality increased at more than twice the rate of wage inequality.

AB This essay, based on a "militant ethnography" of the attempts of the

   mobilize a collective oppositional politics through activities around an

   arguments on discourse and collectivity in Hegemony and Socialist
   Strategy (London: Verso, 1985). I argue, on the basis of my findings,
   that while their model does provide insights that help describe the
   process of building collectivity from among disparate perspectives and
   identities, we need to go beyond a focus on discourse alone and consider
   the ways politics is shaped by material contexts. This is necessary if
   we are to understand the continued appeal of class politics as well as
   the difficulties in mobilizing collectivity in highly unequal and
   fragmented cities. From an activist perspective, the essay also
   highlights how developing a conception of collective interests and a
   critique of overarching systems of exploitation can be important in
   building political unity.

   the state over responsibility for neglected African American children in
   the early twentieth century. After a long history of exclusion by
   private child welfare, the court assumed public responsibility for the
   protection of children of all races. Yet, in an arrangement of delegated
   governance, judges found themselves unable to place non-white children
   because of the enduring exclusionary policies of private agencies. When
   the situation became critical, the City sought to wrest control from
   private agencies by developing a supplemental public foster care system.
   This compromise over responsibility racialized the developing public
   foster care system of New York City, and it transformed frameworks of
   child protection as a social problem. The findings highlight the
   political salience surrounding issues of racial access in the delegated
   welfare state. Tracing how the conflict over access unfolded in New York
   City child protection provides an empirical case for understanding how
   the delegation of social welfare to private agencies can actually weaken
   racial integration efforts, generate distinct modes of social welfare
   inclusion, and racialize perceptions of social problems.

TI Anti-elite politics and emotional reactions to socio-economic problems:
   Experimental evidence on "pocketbook anger" from France, Germany, and

AB Many observers have noticed the importance of anger in contemporary
   politics, particularly with reference to populism. This article
   addresses the question under which conditions people become angry about
   a specific aspect of their lives: their personal financial situation.
   Specifically, it asks if populist anti-elite rhetoric has a causal
   influence on anger and if this influence differs across socio-economic
   groups. The theoretical expectation is that anti-elite rhetoric allows
   people to externalize responsibility for an unfavorable financial
   situation and thereby to turn negative self-conscious emotions into
   anger. The argument is tested with original survey data from France,
   Germany, and the United States. The empirical analysis yields three main
   insights. First, negative emotional reactions to respondents' personal
   finances (and anger in particular) are surprisingly widespread in all
   three countries. Second, there is a pronounced socio-economic gradient
   in the distribution of anger and other negative emotions. Third, and
   most importantly, randomly exposing participants to populist anti-elite
   rhetoric causes considerably higher expressed anger about one's
   financial situation in France and Germany, but less so in the United
   States. This suggests a causal role of anti-elite rhetoric in stirring
   "pocketbook anger." This is true in particular in the middle classes.
   The notion that populist rhetoric reduces negative self-conscious
   emotions, such as shame, is not supported by the data.

AB Scholars and pundits have long noted the dominance of the American
   two-party system, but we know relatively little about new, endogenous
   institutions that have emerged within the two major parties. I argue
   that ideological factions provide party sub-brands, which allow
   legislators to more precisely define their partisan type and capture
   faction-specific resources. To support this claim, I analyze new data on
   nine ideological factions in the House of Representatives (1995-2018). I
   find that (1) faction voting is distinct, suggesting a product ripe for
   party sub-branding, and (2) joining a faction changes the ideological
   composition of a candidate's donor base-conditional on the strength of
   the faction's institutions. Party sub-branding is effective only when
   factions possess organizational features that induce coordinated and
   disciplined position taking (e.g., whips, PACs, membership
   restrictions). These results suggest that, even within highly polarized
   parties, American political ideology is more than a dichotomous choice,
   and factions target niche markets of political donors as a means of
   blunting financial instruments of party power.

AB Despite a long history of legal challenges alleging that elections

   dominant electoral system in local governments throughout the United
   States. Moreover, a large empirical literature remains divided over the
   present-day impact of at-large elections on the political success of
   underrepresented groups. We reconcile the competing findings in this
   literature by providing contingent, causal estimates of the effect of
   conversion from at-large to ward elections on minority officeholding,
   using a novel identification strategy afforded by the California Voting
   Rights Act of 2001. We find a dramatic positive effect of conversion in
   districts where Latinos constitute a sufficiently large share of the
   voting population, and in large and residentially segregated districts.
   When these conditions are not satisfied, we consistently see null
   estimated effects.

AB Through the investigation of kolberi (cross-border labor), this paper
   sheds light on the state's policy of de-development (or internal
   colonialization) of the Kurdish region (known as Rojhelat) in Iran.
   While the most dangerous form of labor, kolberi has become a dominant
   employment opportunity for Rojhelat Kurds in the last decade. There are
   no Iranian state laws criminalizing kolberi, and yet those laborers die
   on a regular basis-being shot or thrown off mountain cliffs by the state
   forces, stepping into minefields, and so forth. Nevertheless, there is
   not a single scholarly paper on this subject. Using the mixed methods
   research approach, our study analyzes the existing data along with
   in-depth interviews with 20 people who are currently engaged in kolberi
   to contextualize this understudied phenomenon. Our finding demonstrates
   that kolberi is a direct outcome of a uni-ethno-religious policies of
   development and part and parcel of the state's Perso-Shi'ification
   strategy in Kurdistan. Therefore, kolberi is more of a political
   phenomenon than an economic one.

PY 2020
AB The connection between social class and political preferences is among
   the most well established in the social sciences. This association is
   typically taken as prima facie evidence of economic self-interest:
   Classes hold different attitudes, values, and party preferences because
   they have different economic interests. However, this assumption has
   rarely been tested empirically. In this article, we use survey data from
   18 West European countries to examine why classes differ on a central
   aspect of political preferences, namely their views on the desirability
   of income inequality. We find that only a moderate proportion of
   differences between employee classes in support for redistribution can
   be accounted for by contemporary differences in resources and risks;
   differences in economic interests to some degree account for the
   anti-redistributive preferences of the professional middle classes
   compared with the working class. However, the preferences of the
   self-employed have a different explanation; autonomy is a better
   explanation of the right-wing preferences of the self-employed compared
   with the working class.

AB As privilege-dependent organizations, U.S. public schools have an
   interest in catering to higher-SES White families. But, what happens
   when privileged families' interests conflict with schools' stated goals?
   Focusing on the case of homework, and drawing insights from
   organizational theory, cultural capital theory, and research on parent
   involvement in schools, I examine how schools' dependence on higher-SES
   White families influences their enforcement of rules. Using a
   longitudinal, ethnographic study of one socioeconomically diverse public
   elementary school, I find that teachers wanted to enforce homework
   rules, but they worried doing so would lead to conflict with the
   higher-SES White "helicopter" parents, on whom they relied most for
   support. Thus, teachers selectively enforced rules, using evidence of
   "helicopter" parenting to determine which students "deserved" leeway and
   lenience. Those decisions, in turn, contributed to inequalities in
   teachers' punishment and evaluation of students. Broadly, these findings
   suggest privilege-dependence leads schools to appease privileged
   families, even when those actions contradict the school's stated goals.
   These findings also challenge standard policy assumptions about parent
   involvement and homework, and they suggest policies aimed at reducing
   the power of privilege are necessary for lessening inequalities in
   school.

AB Why do women continue to face barriers to success in professions,
   especially male-dominated ones, despite often outperforming men in
   similar subjects during schooling? With this study, we draw on role
   expectations theory to understand how inequality in assessment emerges
   as individuals transition from student to professional roles. To do
   this, we leverage the case of medical residency so that we can examine
   how changes in role expectations shape assessment while holding
   occupation and organization constant. By analyzing a dataset of 2,765
   performance evaluations from a three-year emergency medicine training
   program, we empirically demonstrate that women and men are reviewed as
   equally capable at the beginning of residency, when the student role
   dominates; however, in year three, when the colleague role dominates,
   men are perceived as outperforming women. Furthermore, when we hold
   resident performance somewhat constant by comparing feedback to medical
   errors of similar severity, we find that in the third year of residency,
   but not the first, women receive more harsh criticism and less
   supportive feedback than men. Ultimately, this study suggests that role
   expectations, and the implicit biases they can trigger, matter
   significantly to the production of gender inequality, even when holding
   organization, occupation, and resident performance constant.

AB How do members of dominant groups, like White people in the United
   States, react when their privileged social status is threatened, for
   example, by the prospect of numeric decline? Prior studies identify two
   sets of reactions: (1) White people identify more strongly with ingroup
   members, and (2) they withhold material and symbolic resources from
   outgroup members. This study explores another possibility: White people
   may alter the boundary around Whiteness by redefining the criteria for
   membership. I use an original survey experiment to examine how
   demographic threat affects how White people in the United States
   classify people who are ambiguously White, and specifically people who
   are ambiguously White or Latino. The results reveal that White people
   are less-not more-likely to classify people who are ambiguously White or
   Latino as "White" under threat. The results contribute to a growing
   literature on the racial classification of multiracial and racially
   ambiguous people that has previously ignored ambiguity around the Latino
   category. They also speak to an active debate about demographic
   projections and the classification decisions on which they rest.

   Medicare, where diagnoses do not affect most provider payments. Our
   estimates imply that upcoding generates billions in excess public

   show that coding intensity increases with vertical integration,
   suggesting a principal-agent problem faced by insurers, who desire more
   intense coding from the providers with whom they contract.

AB In the early 20th century, police departments across America's cities
   enhanced their infrastructural power by adopting various tactical,
   operational, and organizational innovations. Based upon a nested
   cross-city analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, including a
   negative binomial regression analysis of the determinants of
   militarization, this study reveals that these innovations constituted an
   early form of militarization resulting from imperial feedback. Local
   police borrowed tactics, techniques, and organizational templates from
   America's imperial-military regime that had been developed to conquer
   and rule foreign populations. Imperial feedback occurred as a result of
   imperial importers, many of them veterans of America's imperial-military
   apparatus, who constructed analogies between colonial subjects abroad
   and racialized minorities at home. The study identifies an early form of
   police militarization, reveals the imperial origins of police
   militarization, and offers a potentially transportable theory of
   imperial feedback that stands as one among other possible routes to
   police militarization.

AB How do right to work laws affect the distribution of economic resources?
   While sociological theories would predict inequality to increase
   following their passage, previous research finds these laws to be
   largely inconsequential. The author compiles a unique data set of 77
   years of income and wage inequality data from the Internal Revenue
   Service, the U.S. census, the U.S. Union Sourcebook, and the National
   Labor Relations Board. After replicating inconsistent results from
   previous studies, the author shows that they mask substantial and robust
   heterogeneity across local areas. Right to work laws are consequential
   when passed in times and places where labor has something to lose. They
   remove the negative association between labor union membership and
   inequality, with the greatest consequences of right to work passage in
   highly unionized areas. In total, results suggest that right to work
   laws work as intended, increasing economic inequality indirectly by
   lowering labor power resources. Theoretical and policy implications are
   discussed.

   has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice
   involvement on an individual's ability to find work postrelease. This
   article explores how workers' exposure to the criminal justice system is
   related to labor organization-a labor market institution through which
   workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and
   that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three
   analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the
   criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a
   fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from
   employers' increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may
   discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of
   participating in organizations through which they might gain economic
   power individually and collectively.

DI 10.3982/ECTA17041

AB Weak contract enforcement may reduce the efficiency of production in
   developing countries. I study how contract enforcement affects
   efficiency in procurement auctions for the largest power projects in
   India. I gather data on bidding and ex post contract renegotiation and
   find that the renegotiation of contracts in response to cost shocks is
   widespread, despite that bidders are allowed to index their bids to
   future costs like the price of coal. To study heterogeneity in bidding
   strategies, I construct a new measure of firm connectedness, based on
   whether a firm has been awarded coal concessions by the Government.
   Connected firms choose to index less of the value of their bids to coal
   prices and, through this strategy, expose themselves to cost shocks to
   induce renegotiation. I use a structural model of bidding in a scoring
   auction to characterize equilibrium bidding when bidders are
   heterogeneous both in cost and in the payments they expect after
   renegotiation. The model estimates show that bidders offer power below
   cost due to the expected value of later renegotiation. The model is used
   to simulate bidding and efficiency with strict contract enforcement.
   Contract enforcement is found to be pro-competitive. With no
   renegotiation, equilibrium bids would rise to cover cost, but markups
   relative to total contract value fall sharply. Production costs decline,
   due to projects being allocated to lower-cost bidders over those who
   expect larger payments in renegotiation.

AB We study the incidence of nonlinear labor income taxes in an economy
   with a continuum of endogenous wages. We derive in closed form the
   effects of reforming non-linearly an arbitrary tax system, by showing
   that this problem can be formalized as an integral equation. Our tax
   incidence formulas are valid both when the underlying assignment of
   skills to tasks is fixed or endogenous. We show qualitatively and
   quantitatively that contrary to conventional wisdom, if the tax system
   is initially suboptimal and progressive, the general-equilibrium
   "trickle-down" forces may raise the benefits of increasing the marginal
   tax rates on high incomes. We finally derive a parsimonious
   characterization of optimal taxes.

DI 10.3982/ECTA13426
PD MAR 2020
PY 2020
AB We extend Kreps and Wilson's concept of sequential equilibrium to games
   with infinite sets of signals and actions. A strategy profile is a
   conditional epsilon-equilibrium if, for any of a player's positive
   probability signal events, his conditional expected utility is within
   epsilon of the best that he can achieve by deviating. With topologies on
   action sets, a conditional epsilon-equilibrium is full if strategies
   give every open set of actions positive probability. Such full
   conditional epsilon-equilibria need not be subgame perfect, so we
   consider a non-topological approach. Perfect conditional
   epsilon-equilibria are defined by testing conditional
   epsilon-rationality along nets of small perturbations of the players'
   strategies and of nature's probability function that, for any action and
   for almost any state, make this action and state eventually (in the net)
   always have positive probability. Every perfect conditional
   epsilon-equilibrium is a subgame perfect epsilon-equilibrium, and, in
   finite games, limits of perfect conditional epsilon-equilibria as
   epsilon -> 0 are sequential equilibrium strategy profiles. But limit
   strategies need not exist in infinite games so we consider instead the
   limit distributions over outcomes. We call such outcome distributions
   perfect conditional equilibrium distributions and establish their
   existence for a large class of regular projective games. Nature's
   perturbations can produce equilibria that seem unintuitive and so we
   augment the game with a net of permissible perturbations.

AB Can digital information and communication technology foster mass

   entire African continent between 1998 and 2012 on the coverage of mobile
   phone signal together with georeferenced data from multiple sources on
   the occurrence of protests and on individual participation in protests
   to bring this argument to empirical scrutiny. We find that while mobile
   phones are instrumental to mass mobilization, this only happens during
   economic downturns, when reasons for grievance emerge and the cost of
   participation falls. The results are in line with insights from a
   network model with imperfect information and strategic complementarities
   in protest occurrence. Mobile phones make individuals more responsive to
   both changes in economic conditions-a mechanism that we ascribe to
   enhanced information-and to their neighbors' participation-a mechanism
   that we ascribe to enhanced coordination.

AB New ways of doing things often get started through the actions of a few
   innovators, then diffuse rapidly as more and more people come into
   contact with prior adopters in their social network. Much of the
   literature focuses on the speed of diffusion as a function of the
   network topology. In practice, the topology may not be known with any
   precision, and it is constantly in flux as links are formed and severed.
   Here, we establish an upper bound on the expected waiting time until a
   given proportion of the population has adopted that holds independently
   of the network structure. Kreindler and Young (2014) demonstrated such a
   bound for regular networks when agents choose between two options: the
   innovation and the status quo. Our bound holds for directed and
   undirected networks of arbitrary size and degree distribution, and for
   multiple competing innovations with different payoffs.

   balance. We investigate the structure of this balance condition, taking
   agents' matching behavior as given. Building on the "fundamental
   matching lemma" for quadratic search technologies in Shimer and Smith
   (2000), we establish existence, uniqueness, and comparative statics
   properties of the solution to the balance condition for any search
   technology satisfying minimal regularity conditions. Implications for
   the existence and structure of steady state equilibria in the
   Shimer-Smith model and extensions thereof are noted. These reinforce the
   point that much of the structure of search-and-matching models with
   quadratic search technologies carries over to more general search
   technologies.

AB We study preferences over lotteries in which both the prize and the
   payment date are uncertain. In particular, a time lottery is one in
   which the prize is fixed but the date is random. With Expected
   Discounted Utility, individuals must be risk seeking over time lotteries
   (RSTL). In an incentivized experiment, however, we find that almost all
   subjects violate this property. Our main contributions are theoretical.
   We first show that within a very broad class of models, which includes
   many forms of nonexpected utility and time discounting, it is impossible
   to accommodate even a single violation of RSTL without also violating a
   property we termed Stochastic Impatience, a risky counterpart of
   standard Impatience. We then present two positive results. If one wishes
   to maintain Stochastic Impatience, violations of RSTL can be
   accommodated by keeping Independence within periods while relaxing it
   across periods. If, instead, one is willing to forego Stochastic
   Impatience, violations of RSTL can be accommodated with a simple
   generalization of Expected Discounted Utility, obtained by imposing only
   the behavioral postulates of Discounted Utility and Expected Utility.

AB In this paper, we study the role of the transportation sector in world
   trade. We build a spatial model that centers on the interaction of the
   market for (oceanic) transportation services and the market for world
   trade in goods. The model delivers equilibrium trade flows, as well as
   equilibrium trade costs (shipping prices). Using detailed data on vessel
   movements and shipping prices, we document novel facts about shipping
   patterns; we then flexibly estimate our model. We use this setup to
   demonstrate that the transportation sector (i) attenuates differences in
   the comparative advantage across countries; (ii) generates network
   effects in trade costs; and (iii) dampens the impact of shocks on trade
   flows. These three mechanisms reveal a new role for geography in
   international trade that was previously concealed by the frequently-used
   assumption of exogenous trade costs. Finally, we illustrate how our
   setup can be used for policy analysis by evaluating the impact of future
   and existing infrastructure projects (e.g., Northwest Passage, Panama

   version of belief operator, we explore the restrictions that prior
   beliefs impose on higher order beliefs. In particular, we obtain a
   nontrivial lower bound on the probability of a common belief event,
   uniform over type spaces, when the underlying game has a monotone
   potential. Conversely, when the game has no monotone potential, we
   construct a type space with an arbitrarily high probability event in
   which players never have common belief about that event. As an
   implication of these results, we show for generic binary-action
   supermodular games that an action profile is robust to incomplete
   information if and only if it is a monotone potential maximizer. Our
   study offers new methodology and insight to the analysis of global game

   Exploiting an exogenous source of variations in population diversity

   demonstrates that population diversity, and its impact on the degree of
   diversity within ethnic groups, has contributed significantly to the

   findings arguably reflect the contribution of population diversity to
   the non-cohesiveness of society, as reflected partly in the prevalence

   thicken the market substantially reduces the fraction of unmatched

   specify conditions under which local algorithms that choose the right

AB Research on part-time work has concentrated over many decades on the
   experiences of women but male part-time employment is growing in the UK.
   This article addresses two sizable gaps in knowledge concerning male
   part-timers: are men's part-time jobs of lower quality than men's
   full-time jobs? Are male part-timers more or less job-satisfied compared
   to their full-time peers? A fundamental part of both interrogations is
   whether men's part-time employment varies by occupational class. The
   article is motivated by the large body of work on female part-timers.
   Its theoretical framework is rooted in one of the most controversial
   discussions in the sociology of women workers: the "grateful slave"
   debate that emerged in the 1990s when researchers sought to explain why
   so many women expressed job satisfaction with low-quality part-time
   jobs. Innovatively, this article draws upon those contentious ideas to
   provide new insights into male, rather than female, part-time
   employment. Based upon analysis of a large quantitative data set, the
   results provide clear evidence of low-quality male part-time employment
   in the UK, when compared with men's full-time jobs. Men working
   part-time also express deteriorating satisfaction with jobs overall and
   in several specific dimensions of their jobs. Male part-timers in lower
   occupational class positions retain a clear "lead" both in bad job
   quality and low satisfaction. The article asks whether decreasingly
   satisfied male part-time workers should be termed "ungrateful slaves?"
   It unpacks the "grateful slave" metaphor and, after doing so, rejects
   its value for the ongoing analysis of part-time jobs in the formal labor
   market.

AB Comparative research into intergenerational social mobility has been

   of this paper is to widen the perspective, and to provide an up-to-date
   account of rates of intergenerational class mobility across 30 European
   countries, using a newly-constructed comparative data-set based on the
   European Social Survey. Absolute mobility rates are found to vary quite
   widely with national differences in the extent and pattern of class
   structural change. As regards relative rates, countries are best seen as
   falling into groups within comparatively high and low fluidity sets,
   within which groups a high degree of cross-national commonality
   prevails. Further results indicate that country differences in relative
   rates play only a very limited part in accounting for country
   differences in absolute rates, confirming that the latter are primarily
   determined by class structural change. Based on our findings, we suggest
   a restatement of the FJH-hypothesis to the effect that in societies with
   a capitalist market economy, a nuclear family system and a
   liberal-democratic polity, a limit exists to the extent to which
   relative rates of class mobility can be equalized, which countries may
   move closer to or, in the case of post-socialist societies, recede from.

AB Precarious work, which has become more prevalent in the United States in
   recent decades, is disproportionately experienced by workers of lower
   socio-economic classes, and research suggests that the erosion of worker
   power has contributed to this class polarization in precarity. One
   dimension of precarious work of growing interest to scholars and
   policymakers is instability faced by workers in the amount and
   regularity of their work hours. However, we know little about the
   magnitude of month-to-month or week-to-week (intra-year) volatility in
   hours worked, the extent of class-based polarization in this measure of
   job quality, and whether worker power moderates this polarization. In
   this paper, we make novel use of the panel nature of the
   nationally-representative Current Population Survey (CPS) to estimate
   intra-year volatility in the actual hours respondents report working in
   the previous week across four consecutive survey months. Using this new
   measure, we then show that, net of demographic characteristics and
   controls for occupation and industry, low-wage workers experience
   disproportionately greater work hour volatility. Finally, we find
   evidence that reductions in marketplace bargaining power-as measured by
   higher state-level unemployment rates-increase wage- and education-based
   polarization in work hour volatility, while increases in associational
   power-as measured by union coverage-reduce wage-based polarization in
   work hour volatility.

AB Since the early 1990s, the social safety net for families with children
   in the United States has undergone an epochal transformation. Aid to
   poor working families has become more generous. In contrast, assistance
   to the deeply poor has become less generous, and what remains more often
   takes the form of in-kind aid. A historical view finds that this
   dramatic change parallels others. For centuries, the nature and form of
   poor relief has been driven in part by shifting cultural notions of
   which social groups are "deserving" and "undeserving." This line was
   firmly redrawn in the 1990s. Did the re-institutionalization of these
   categorizations in policy have material consequences? This study
   examines the relationship between the decline of traditional cash
   welfare between 2001 and 2015 and two direct measures of wellbeing among
   households with children: household food insecurity and public school
   child homelessness. Using models that control for state and year trends,
   along with other factors, we find that the decline of cash assistance
   was associated with increases in both forms of hardship.

AB Europe faces the challenge of enormous recent asylum seeker inflows, and
   the allocation of these immigrants across European countries remains
   severely skewed, with some countries having a much larger per capita
   share of asylum applicants than others. Consequently, there is a debate
   at the EU level on how to allocate asylum seekers in order to tackle
   this imbalance. The present study focuses on preferences of European
   citizens towards the supranational policy issue of achieving a more
   equalized distribution of asylum seekers. Several theoretical arguments
   point towards asylum seeker intake, general immigrants' legal status,
   prior immigration stocks, and economic circumstances as explanatory
   mechanisms at the macro level. We test these propositions using
   Eurobarometer data from 2015. The results show that a high level of
   asylum seeker intake and larger immigrant stocks in 2010 are associated
   with a greater willingness to redistribute asylum seekers. Apart from
   this, integration policies also play a role: the more inclusive a
   country's political stance towards Third-Country Nationals, the higher
   the public support for a better allocation of asylum seekers. These
   results also emerge when excluding the top five asylum seeking
   destinations. At the individual level, views of the EU as a competent
   political actor and general immigration attitudes are substantially
   related to the support for redistribution efforts. These
   individual-level patterns occur both in countries with many and in
   countries with few asylum seekers, indicating that respondents largely
   take a broad European view on this topic, rather than a national one.

AB Over the past several decades, citizenship status has become more
   important in immigrant lives and communities in the United States.
   Undocumented adults who arrived as children, the 1.5 generation,
   comprise a growing percentage of the immigrant population. Although they
   are similar to children of immigrants born in the United States (the
   second generation) they face a variety of barriers to integration due to
   their lack of legal status. Based on over five years of ethnographic
   fieldwork with mainly 1.5 and second generation Mexican-American men
   during a period of major healthcare reform, this paper addresses how
   citizenship status and embeddedness within multi-status communities
   impacts immigrant experiences in the healthcare domain. In particular, I
   argue that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has contributed to an
   institutionalization of the status differences and a further
   differentiation in the social integration of these groups of children of
   immigrants. The novel methodological approach and the data which emerges
   through fieldwork reveals important insights into the process whereby
   healthcare reforms have consequences for immigrant communities which I

AB Immigration to rich democracies grew substantially in the 1990s and
   2000s. We investigate whether the rise of immigration influenced the
   novel and salient outcome of preferences for greater law enforcement
   spending. We propose that these preferences are consequential for
   policymaking, reflect popular demand for punitive social control, and
   represent micro-level preferences underlying the politics of criminal
   justice. Motivated by literatures on criminal justice politics, minority
   threat, and the fear of crime, we examine whether stocks and flows of
   immigration influence individual-level preferences for greater law
   enforcement spending. Using International Social Survey Programme (ISSP)
   data, we analyze between-country variation with multi-level models of 25
   countries in 2006, and within-country variation with
   differences-in-differences (DD) models of 16 countries with available
   data in both 1996 and 2006. Both multilevel and DD models show that
   flows of immigration increase preferences for greater law enforcement
   spending. Indeed, the coefficients for immigration flows are larger than
   or comparable in magnitude to the coefficients for any other variable,
   and are robust net of homicide rates and police officers per 100,000. By
   contrast, the stock of immigrants is not robustly associated with
   preferences. The results demonstrate that rising immigration contributed
   to increasing public support for greater law enforcement spending.

AB The rapid expansion of schooling across low-income countries, combined
   with intensive governmental and nongovernmental efforts to promote
   education, has encouraged youth in these contexts to form exceptionally
   high educational expectations, despite immense structural barriers to
   achieving them. Consequently, many young people's educational
   expectations go unmet, driving concerns over the possible unintended
   consequences, including their elevated risk of mental health problems.
   At the same time, role transitions (e.g., marriage, parenthood) remain
   important elements of the transition to adulthood in many low-income
   countries, and may be a source of resilience-allowing youth to shift
   their identity away from education towards a new role. In this study, we
   explore the mental health implications of young women's unmet
   educational expectations, and the possible buffering impact of
   motherhood, in a low-income community in Malawi, in southeast Africa.
   Analyses of six years of longitudinal data show that young women's unmet
   expectations to continue school are associated with multiple indicators
   of mental health disadvantage across two points in time. In the short
   term, however, this is only true of young women who did not enter
   motherhood in the midst of their educational plans going unrealized:
   young women who became mothers-and thus achieved a key element of the
   transition to adulthood in this setting-experience fewer mental health
   disadvantages. The findings demonstrate the potential mental health
   consequences of young adults' expectations exceeding their outcomes
   while also highlighting a source of resilience.

AB Educational assortative mating patterns in the United States have
   changed since the 1960s, but we know little about the effects of these
   patterns on children, particularly on infant health. Rising educational
   homogamy may alter prenatal contexts through parental stress and
   resources, with implications for inequality. Using 1969-1994 NVSS birth
   data and aggregate cohort-state census measures of spousal similarity of
   education and labor force participation as instrumental variables (IV),
   this study estimates the effects of parental educational similarity on
   infant health. Controlling for both maternal and paternal education,
   results support family systems theory and suggest that parental
   educational homogamy is beneficial for infant health while hypergamy is
   detrimental. These effects are stronger in later cohorts and are
   generally limited to mothers with more education. Hypogamy estimates are
   stable by cohort, suggesting that rising female hypogamy may have
   limited effect on infant health. In contrast, rising educational
   homogamy could have increasing implications for infant health. Effects
   of parental homogamy on infant health could help explain racial
   inequality of infant health and may offer a potential mechanism through
   which inequality is transmitted between generations.

AB Most scholarship on violence in urban communities accepts the Weberian
   association between legitimate violence and the state. Under this
   assumption, extrajudicial violence is interpreted as a symptom of legal
   cynicism, which is fomented by a negligent or illegitimate state
   apparatus. How, then, do we explain communities in which extrajudicial
   violence and legal authority are seen as legitimate simultaneously?
   Drawing on ethnographic observations of interactions among an armed
   group, residents, and police officials in a poor zone of Medellin,
   Colombia, I found that residents routinely appealed to the armed group
   and police to supply security and redress grievances. This indicates
   that structurally induced problems of police corruption and legal
   cynicism cannot fully explain the patterns of enduring violence I
   observed. Residents and police situationally endorsed and authorized
   violence specialists and extrajudicial punishments as legitimate
   elements of the local security system. In doing so, community members
   played a key role in constructing violence as an acceptable practice for
   enhancing security and placating locals who had been assaulted. This
   study augments the state-centric literature on urban violence with
   social psychological theories of legitimation. It leverages rare in situ
   data on violence to advance an interactional, meaning-based perspective
   on a longstanding problem in poor urban communities.

AB Recent increases in the average age at first marriage have created an
   extended period during which young adults frequently continue to
   socialize with friends, even as romantic ties typically become
   increasingly serious. Nevertheless, little research has focused on some
   of the challenges associated with navigating these two social worlds
   simultaneously. The current study expanded the traditional lens of
   social learning theory to investigate associations between a range of
   attitudes and behaviors of friends and a serious form of
   conflict-intimate partner violence (IPV). Analyses relied on structured
   survey and in-depth interview data from a longitudinal study of a large,
   diverse sample of male and female respondents followed across the
   adolescent to adult transition (n = 928). Consistent with prior work,
   friends' IPV experience was significantly associated with respondents'
   own IPV perpetration. Yet the social learning perspective we developed
   highlighted the importance of considering a broader portfolio of
   friends' characteristics. Controlling for friends' IPV experience and
   family background: (a) involvement with friends perceived as more
   liberal in their attitudes toward dating and sexuality and (b) friends'
   delinquent behavior were both associated with the odds of reporting IPV.
   Further, longitudinal analyses showed an effect of variability in
   friends' delinquency on within-individual changes in IPV across the full
   study period, suggesting that the association is not due solely to an
   underlying antisocial propensity. In-depth interviews with a subset of
   respondents (n = 102) corroborate these results, further illuminate
   underlying mechanisms, and highlight the dynamic aspects of these forms
   of social involvement during young adulthood.

AB Research has begun to examine the consequences of paternity leave,
   focusing primarily on whether paternity leave-taking increases father
   involvement. Yet, other consequences of paternity leave-taking have not
   been considered using US data. This study uses longitudinal data from
   the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to examine whether
   fathers' time off from work after the birth of a child is associated
   with relationship quality, relationship support, and coparenting
   quality. We also consider whether these relationships are mediated by
   father involvement. Results suggest that fathers' time off of work after
   a birth and length of time off are each positively associated with
   relationship quality and coparenting quality one year after a child's
   birth. They are also positively associated with trajectories of
   relationship quality and coparenting quality over the first five years
   after birth. Father involvement at least partially mediates these
   relationships. Overall, this study suggests that the potential benefits
   of fathers' time off of work after the birth of a child may extend
   beyond father involvement and may improve parental relationships.

AB As the Internet's role in creating new couples continues to expand, now
   accounting for over a third of recently-formed U.S. couples, its impact
   on endogamy is increasingly consequential. While there are good reasons
   to expect greater diversity from online romantic sources, there are also
   good sociological reasons to predict greater assortativity online.
   Increases in the rates of interracial and interreligious couples within
   the U.S. have occurred seemingly in tandem with the rise of online
   dating, but the evidence connecting online romances and couple
   heterogeneity have been limited and mixed. Using a unique
   nationally-representative dataset collected in 2009 and 2017 on how U.S.
   couples met, and controlling for the diversity of their local
   geographies, I find that couples who met online are more likely to be
   interracial, interreligious, and of different college degree status, but
   also more similar in age. Couples who met online are not more nor less
   likely to cross political boundaries, however, and not more nor less
   likely to have educationally different mothers. These exogamy
   differences can vary by where on the Internet couples met.
   Population-level estimates suggest that only a small part of the recent
   changes in couple diversity can be directly attributed to couples
   meeting online, but there is the potential for more Internet-induced
   change if it continues to expand as the modal source of romance.

AB Ghostwriters represent a form of labor aimed at producing someone else's
   self, or what we label "stand-in labor." This growing workforce sits at
   the intersection of critical developments in today's neoliberal economy:
   the rise in self-branding, the growth in outsourcing of the self, and
   mounting income inequality. This article explores the experience of
   stand-in workers and its implication on the economy of self. Relying on
   72 interviews with ghostwriters and publishing industry insiders, we
   show that ghostwriters face recognition estrangement because they are
   often asked to stay out of public view for the crafted selves to prove
   "authentic." As creative workers with a high degree of investment in
   their work, ghostwriters are quite sensitive to this form of
   estrangement. They manage this tension in a unique way: they claim a
   professional need to disappear in order to properly put forth a
   subject's "true" voice, yet emphasize their active contribution to the
   crafting of a subject's public self that differs from the subject's
   "true" self. In doing so, ghostwriters alter the subjects they
   impersonate by creating a distance between the subjects' crafted and
   "actual" selves. Our study therefore uncovers a paradoxical
   dynamic-namely, taking professional pride in disappearing, yet
   reappearing in the act of altering others' selves-that we posit might
   prove inherent to the performance of stand-in labor. More broadly, we
   suggest that many stand-in workers engaged in this growing economy of
   self might alter the people they impersonate, thus leading to a
   situation where calls for authenticity breed adulteration.

AB Over the last several decades, dozens of dictatorships have become

   varied in the extent to which their citizens realize the ideal of
   self-rule. Why do some democracies distribute power to citizens while
   other democracies withhold it? Existing research is suggestive, but its
   implications are ambiguous. Cross-national studies have focused on
   democracy's formal dimensions, while work on substantive democracy is
   case-based. We find that one of the most consistent and powerful
   explanations of substantive democratization is the length of unarmed
   pro-democratic mobilization prior to a transition. Through a case study
   of Brazil, we illustrate that these movements matter in three ways:
   first, because practices of self-organizing model and enable democratic
   reforms; second, because movement veterans use state office to deepen
   democracy; and third, because long movements yield civil societies with
   the capacity to demand the continuous deepening of democracy.

AB Is climate change discourse highly politicized and divisive, or has the
   debate instead become "post-political," oriented around consensus,
   problem-solving and administrative management? Adjudicating this debate
   is important for pragmatic and theoretical reasons. Pragmatically, these
   divergent characterizations suggest different barriers climate discourse
   might pose for engaging public concern and citizen mobilization.
   Theoretically, these characterizations provide different understandings
   of how elites respond to structural crisis. Using automated text
   analysis to describe a large corpus of organizations' press releases
   about climate change from 1985 to 2013 (N = 1,768), I find that this
   discourse has been largely expert-oriented and technocratic, neglecting
   concerns of values and identity widely believed to be important for
   social movement mobilization. Organizations predominantly frame climate
   change as a problem that, while real and serious, is best handled
   through the careful and deliberate work of scientific, political, and
   economic elites. Surprisingly, these observations remain true even among
   advocacy organizations. These findings provide empirical support that a
   "post-political" framing of climate change, where the issue is discussed
   in a way that neutralizes social and political power dynamics, dominates
   American organizations' official pronouncements about climate change. To
   the extent that earlier scholars are correct that conflict-oriented
   discursive strategies-such as identification of a common antagonist-are
   effective at rousing public concern, this discourse is unlikely to
   mobilize strong public emotion and activism.

   desire for sex, sexual activity, and contraceptive use. The strength of
   young women's desire varies across demographic characteristics like
   religiosity and social class; changes after pivotal events like sexual
   debut; and varies with social ecology, such as friends' attitudes. When
   women more strongly desire sex they are more likely to have sex and to
   use hormonal contraception. Moreover, the association between desire and
   sex is especially pronounced when women are using a hormonal method. In
   contrast, when women more strongly desire sex they are less likely to
   use condoms or withdrawal, irrespective of hormonal use. These findings
   suggest that sexual desire is socially situated and relevant for both

AB How do political gender quotas affect representation? We suggest that

   politicians may reduce the descriptive representation of traditionally
   disadvantaged ethnic groups. To assess this idea, we examine the
   consequences of the implementation of random electoral quotas for women
   on the representation of caste groups in Delhi. Constituencies reserved
   for women are less likely than unreserved constituencies to elect
   members of groups where the status of women is low. In practice, this
   means they are less likely to elect members of several traditionally
   underprivileged groups (especially OBC castes) and more likely to elect
   candidates from the Hindu upper castes. The results highlight the
   difficulties of balancing descriptive representation on multiple,

   stance of new political actors and (2) elites have a comparative

   standard deviation increase in violent events by right-wing
   paramilitaries. We interpret this surge in violence as a reaction of
   traditional elites to offset the increase in outsiders' access to formal
   political power. Consistent with this interpretation, we find that
   violence by left-wing guerrillas and other actors is unaffected and that
   violence is not influenced by the victory of right-wing or other new

   deployed to not only construct Muslims as problems and dangers to the

   policies within the frame of biopower. The article begins by sketching
   the contours of the contemporary "Muslim Question" and proceeds with a
   critical engagement with the literature positing a deliberate and

AB Measuring how much citizens care about different policy issues is

   eliciting respondents' positions on different issues with (b) a conjoint
   experiment asking respondents to trade off departures from their
   preferred positions on those issues. Applying this method to study the
   relative importance of 34 issues in the United Kingdom, we show that
   British voters attach significant importance to issues like the death

AB Robert Fine was among the most original social theorists in Britain of
   the past 30 years, and the aim of this paper is to offer a first
   systematic assessment of his intellectual contribution. There are sound
   intellectual reasons to explore Fine's scholarship. He maintained a
   problematic relation with mainstream sociology and, against the
   reduction of sociology to questions of method, culture, or class, he
   argued that sociologists must continue to ask difficult normative
   questions as part of the social world they ought to explain. And there
   are also pressing political concerns that justify a reconsideration of
   his writings. Global politics is currently marked by a populist wave
   that decries the very ideas and values that were central to Fine's
   social theory: the need to uphold the rule of law at home and abroad,
   the politics of cosmopolitan solidarity, and the significance of
   antisemitism and its relationships with different forms of authoritarian
   politics. My main argument is that there is a dialectics of universality
   that drives forward Fine's intellectual project. By this, I mean that a
   universalistic idea of humanity-an all-inclusive conception of all human
   beings-is the most important normative intuition of modern times. This
   idea of humanity moves forward in history through a dual process of
   emancipation and domination: successful forms of social, legal, and
   political inclusion help make visible previous dynamics of exclusion but
   may also create or recreate discriminatory practices. Building on the
   work of French historian Michael Lowy on heterodox Jewish thinkers, I
   explain the three main tenets of Fine's work: (a) his reconstruction of
   critical social theory; (b) the notion of cosmopolitan solidarity; and
   (c) the significance and main features of modern antisemitism.

AB This article offers a first subnational analysis of the relationship
   between states' dynamic control of Internet access and their use of
   violent repression. I argue that where governments provide Internet
   access, surveillance of digital information exchange can provide
   intelligence that enables the use of more targeted forms of repression,
   in particular in areas not fully controlled by the regime. Increasing
   restrictions on Internet accessibility can impede opposition
   organization, but they limit access to information on precise targets,
   resulting in an increase in untargeted repression. I present new data on
   killings in the Syrian conflict that distinguish between targeted and
   untargeted events, using supervised text classification. I find that
   higher levels of Internet accessibility are associated with increases in
   targeted repression, whereas areas with limited access experience more
   indiscriminate campaigns of violence. The results offer important
   implications on how governments incorporate the selective access to
   communication technology into their strategies of coercion.

AB After their successful introduction during the 2007-2009 financial
   crisis, central bank stress tests were adopted as a fixture of
   international banking supervision. However, in recent years a new normal
   has emerged where banks are expected to pass the tests, raising
   questions about the tests' usefulness and legitimacy. Combining a
   dramaturgical interpretation of regulatory science with the idea of
   performativity in the sociology of finance, this article understands
   stress tests as a sociotechnical Goffmanian performance. With a focus on
   the Bank of England's program, the paper argues that the Bank's decision
   to make their tests "predictable" is an attempt to shore up central bank
   legitimacy by constraining regulatory discretion. This is accomplished
   through the use of calculative and procedural stage management
   techniques which allow the Bank to control the contingency of the
   testing process while demonstrating its objectivity. Nevertheless, the
   conclusion suggests that in the context of low levels of trust in
   central banks, routine declarations of "all clear" may undermine public
   confidence in the tests' credibility and necessity. The study draws on
   20 interviews with high-level regulators, financial practitioners and
   other stakeholders in the Bank of England's stress tests.

AB A fundamental challenge facing applied time-series analysts is how to
   draw inferences about long-run relationships (LRR) when we are uncertain
   whether the data contain unit roots. Unit root tests are notoriously
   unreliable and often leave analysts uncertain, but popular extant
   methods hinge on correct classification. Webb, Linn, and Lebo (WLL;
   2019) develop a framework for inference based on critical value bounds
   for hypothesis tests on the long-run multiplier (LRM) that eschews unit
   root tests and incorporates the uncertainty inherent in identifying the
   dynamic properties of the data into inferences about LRRs. We show how
   the WLL bounds procedure can be applied to any fully specified
   regression model to solve this fundamental challenge, extend the results
   of WLL by presenting a general set of critical value bounds to be used
   in applied work, and demonstrate the empirical relevance of the LRM
   bounds procedure in two applications.

   no greater tendency to offer incentives for investment anticipated prior
   to than after elections-a null result that is estimated with high

AB It is well established that encounters between welfare bureaucracies and
   their clients have been reconfigured under neoliberalism to address the
   problem of "welfare dependency." Contemporary bureaucratic encounters
   therefore entail measures to activate clients'
   entrepreneurial/self-governing capacities, and
   conditionality/sanctioning practices to deal with clients who behave
   "irresponsibly." Despite the dominance of the neoliberal model, recent
   research has identified a counter-trend in the practices of housing
   services away from entrepreneurializing and punitive strategies and
   towards a more supportive approach. This paper examines this
   counter-trend and its implications for neoliberal welfare governance. To
   do this, it presents findings from research into social housing
   governance in Queensland, Australia, where the neoliberal focus on
   welfare independence, conditionality and sanctioning has been tempered
   by a new supportive approach focused on assisting vulnerable clients to
   maintain and benefit from access to welfare/housing support. Following
   Larner, we argue that this shift signals the emergence of an "after
   neoliberal" governmental formation, wherein key features of neoliberal
   governmentality are replaced by, or redeployed in the service of,
   progressive initiatives that address neoliberalism's failings at the
   street level, but leave broader neoliberal policy settings undisturbed.
   We also challenge recent sociological accounts that construe supportive
   welfare practices as a function of an all-encompassing neoliberal
   project, arguing instead for appreciation of the contingency of these
   developments and the progressive political affordances that they entail.

PY 2020
AB How do external economic shocks influence domestic politics? We argue
   that those materially exposed to the shock will display systematic
   differences in policy preferences and voting behavior compared to the
   unexposed, and political parties can exploit these circumstances.
   Empirically, we take advantage of the 2015 surprise revaluation of the
   Swiss franc to identify the Polish citizens with direct economic
   exposure to this exogenous event. Using an original survey fielded prior
   to the 2015 elections and an embedded survey experiment, we show that
   exposed individuals were more likely to demand government support and
   more likely to desert the government and vote for the largest opposition
   party, which was able to use the shock to expand its electoral coalition
   without alienating its core voters. Our article clarifies the connection
   between international shocks, voters' policy preferences, partisan
   policy responses, and, ultimately, voting decisions.

AB This study investigates whether families navigate educational
   institutions more successfully if they have a higher knowledge of the
   pathways in the educational system that are available to their children.
   We also study whether this kind of knowledge mediates secondary effects
   of social origin, i.e. differences in educational pathways once
   achievement differences between children are accounted for. The role of
   parents' knowledge is consistent with various sociological theories
   concerning educational inequality. Knowledge can affect families'
   ability to make rational choices for education but it can also be
   understood as a form of cultural capital. We use longitudinal student
   cohort data from the Netherlands combined with individual-level register
   data on educational attainment to study the importance of knowledge for
   short-term outcomes (up- and downward transitions in secondary education
   as well as track placement) and final educational attainment. Our
   results show that parents' knowledge is a significant predictor of
   educational success net of parents' education, socio-demographic
   characteristics, and demonstrated ability. If we apply a stricter test
   to the measure, however, we can see that knowledge matters for downward
   transitions and obtaining a tertiary degree but that the effect is
   negligible for upward transitions and track placement if other
   mechanisms such as cultural capital and aspirations are considered.
   Further, we conclude that knowledge matters especially for transitions
   in the educational system that require a move to a new and unknown
   school environment such as post-secondary or tertiary education. The
   study shows that knowledge is one useful avenue to investigate when we
   are confronted with the question why social disparities in educational
   decision-making arise.

AB There is increasing awareness that the intergenerational transmission of
   (dis)advantages is filtered through intra-familial dynamics, in
   particular, parenting practices. Surprisingly, few studies have
   investigated what role the extent to which fathers and mothers equally
   share childcare responsibilities plays in this transmission. Using data
   from 2,027 families in a Dutch prospective cohort study, our structural
   equation modelling analyses showed direct effects of equally sharing
   responsibilities for playful activities on children's cognitive
   development. Additionally, our study yielded some evidence for the
   hypothesis that equally sharing responsibilities for playful activities
   mediates the impact of parents' educational attainment on children's
   cognitive development. This suggests that the extent to which fathers
   and mothers equally share childcare responsibilities functions as an
   underlying mechanism for maintaining social class disparities in
   children's cognitive development. Our findings also suggest that
   policies and programmes that encourage fathers and mothers to equally
   share playful activities may help promote children's cognitive
   development.

AB Birth order causes social inequality between siblings. In Western
   countries, earlier-born perform better than later-born. In non-Western
   countries, however, earlier-born generally perform worse than
   later-born. We use administrative data to compare birth order effects
   between the native population and Norwegian-born children of immigrants
   (450,864 individuals nested within 202,191 families). The outcome is
   based on lower secondary school points-a combined measurement of all
   marks at the end of compulsory education. We found negative effects of
   birth order on school points for Norwegian natives. This finding is in
   line with previous studies from Western countries using measures of
   educational achievement. Birth order effects amongst Norwegian-born
   children of immigrant parents vary according to maternal country of
   origin, with some displaying similar effects as natives and others
   displaying no birth order effects. These findings are surprising in
   light of the main theories on birth order, which are universalistic and
   do not predict group-differences. We argue that the universalistic
   theories need to be supplemented to account for our findings, and
   discuss the potential importance of cultural variation in family-related
   behaviours such as strategic parenting, kindergarten attendance, and
   peer-influence in high-achieving immigrant groups.

AB It is a well-established finding in the literature that immigrants make
   ambitious educational choices. Once controlling for prior achievement
   and socioeconomic status, children of immigrants are more likely than
   natives to switch to the more demanding educational tracks. However,
   less is known about whether immigrants can actually benefit from these
   optimistic choices in terms of educational attainment or whether they
   have a higher risk of dropping out from the more demanding tracks. By
   focusing on a representative sample of adolescents with and without
   immigrant background in Germany, this contribution investigates how
   enrolment and completion rates change over timefrom the end of lower
   secondary education until the end of upper secondary education-and how
   this affects ethnic inequalities in educational outcomes. When comparing
   academic completion rates and academic enrolment rates in grade 9, we
   observe long-term improvements within the immigrant group as a result of
   immigrants' ambitious choices. When comparing both outcomes between
   natives and immigrants, however, ethnic differences in academic
   completion rates remain comparable to the disparities in enrolment rates
   as observed in grade 9.

AB Both the Wisconsin model of status attainment (WIM) and rational choice
   theory (RCT) indicate that social class differentials in student
   educational aspirations are partially determined by academic
   performance. Conditional on performance, the WIM predicts that social
   influence mechanisms explain the remaining class differentials, whereas
   RCT maintains that rational calculus factors provide the explanation.
   Both theories have rarely been compared directly using large-scale
   empirical data. Moreover, the appropriateness of these models has been
   questioned for highly stratified and selective educational systems such
   as Germany's. In this article, we analyse the extent to which the WIM
   and RCT can explain the relationship between students' social class
   origins and their educational aspirations. We use data from the National
   Educational Panel Study and analysed the aspirations of 4,896
   ninth-graders in German schools along with data about their school
   performance, social class positions, social influences, and rational
   choice factors. Our mixed logit models largely confirm that both social
   influences and rational choice factors mediate class differentials. Five
   factors contribute the most: parents' expectations, friends'
   aspirations, the motive of status maintenance, costs, and perceived
   probability of success. This research confirms that both the WIM and RCT
   can each independently explain aspirations and class differentials in

AB Host country language proficiency has been shown to account for ethnic
   differences in labour market outcomes. Prior studies generally assume
   that language skills represent a form of human capital, affecting
   employees' productivity. However, language proficiency may also be
   associated with discrimination. Lower language proficiency may elicit
   distaste for certain ethnic groups, as it is a prominent reminder of the
   respective origin. When this reminder vanishes as language skills rise,
   group-specific distaste should also reduce. Employers may thus not only
   value language skills in terms of productivity but also factor in less
   group-specific distaste when evaluating immigrant jobseekers with
   high-language skills. Moreover, if employers lack information on
   competences that are hard to observe, high-language proficiency may
   prevent the application of adverse ethnic beliefs. Using data from the
   National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), I examine whether language
   skills affect crucial indicators of labour market success differently
   for groups that vary with respect to the level of distaste associated
   with them. I also investigate whether this effect is conditional on the
   amount of information available to employers. Findings indicate
   group-specific returns to higher-language proficiency, irrespective of
   the available information. This might suggest that, in addition to
   affecting employees' productivity, language proficiency may also be
   associated with taste discrimination for certain ethnic groups.

AB Whether or not putting the unemployed under greater pressure to seek and
   accept jobs really helps to raise levels of employment remains a
   controversially discussed question. Empirical research into this
   question has so far focused on the micro-level whereas the macro-level
   effects remain unexplored. This article fills this gap, using a novel
   comparative dataset on the strictness of job-search and availability
   requirements and sanction rules for unemployment benefit claimants in 21
   countries between 1980 and 2012. It is shown that requiring more active
   job-search and availability for a wider range of jobs does indeed lead
   to increased employment, while no evidence for a similar positive effect
   of tougher sanction rules on employment is found. The data do indicate,
   however, that sanction rules are themselves a product of adverse labour
   market conditions. Interactive estimations also suggest a negative
   moderating influence of tough sanction rules on the effectiveness of
   stricter conditions, whereas more generous unemployment insurance and
   assistance benefits appear to strengthen the effects of stricter
   conditions. Overall, the results suggest that to increase employment,
   the treatment of the unemployed may be demanding but should not be
   punitive and should include supportive elements, providing claimants
   with the resources they need to effectively look for work.

AB Sociological research often uses income as the only indicator to

   three-dimensional: depending on income, wealth, and origin of wealth.
   The relevance of such a multidimensional perspective for social outcomes
   is demonstrated by analysing the heterogeneity in political attitudes
   between different varieties of affluence. For this purpose, ordinary
   least squares regressions are applied to a sample from 2005, 2009, and
   2014 German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP). The main results are, first,
   that the perspective of varieties of affluence reveals significant
   differences in social outcomes as demonstrated by political attitudes.
   Especially wealth possession is related to significantly more right
   political attitudes. Second, there is strong explorative evidence that
   the rich in Germany should be regarded as a heterogeneous group. These
   findings are robust to influential data, multiple imputations of wealth
   data, and endogeneity due to pooled data. The article concludes, among
   other things, that more data are required to make more certain
   assertions.

AB This article examines North American national news media's 2015-16
   presentation of family meals. Analyzing 326 articles, I identify the
   ubiquity of a narrative of deterioration, or the presumption that
   families are replacing meals made from whole, unprocessed ingredients
   consumed communally around a table, with processed and pre-prepared
   foods eaten alone or "on the go". In analyzing the construction of
   responsibility for this deterioration, I find that the sample
   predominately frames the production of healthy family meals as
   constrained by a food environment saturated with inexpensive, highly
   processed food, and dictated by the competing demands of paid work and
   inflated normative standards. Yet, when differentiating frames that
   define the social problem from those that offer solutions, I find that
   individualization prevails in the frames that target solutions. One
   important exception is media reporting on low-income families, which are
   framed as facing exceptional structural constraint. Analyzing these
   frames, I argue that neoliberal ideology that over-emphasizes individual
   agency and minimizes structural constraint operates in more subtle ways
   than previous literature suggests-showing some awareness of the
   difficulty of people's lives, but prescribing solutions that leave
   individuals responsible for the outcomes. These findings offer
   implications for understanding dominant cultural values surrounding
   health and the family meal, as well as the allocation of responsibility
   for social problems within neoliberalism more broadly.

AB Using data from the 1989-2009 Panel Study of Income Dynamics, this
   research examines racial differences in wealth accumulation over the
   life course. We ask: (1) How have racial differences in wealth changed
   over time? (2) Do racial wealth gaps change over the life course? (3)
   Are racial gaps in net worth expanding, contracting, or staying the same
   over time and over the life course? and (4) Do these patterns differ by
   cohort? The analysis is informed by (1) the declining significance of
   race and post-racial perspectives; (2) the cumulative effects of
   discrimination explanation; and (3) the vintage hypothesis. Results show
   that African Americans' wealth as a percentage of whites' wealth fell in
   2009. Results do not support the declining significance of race and
   post-racial perspectives. Partially consistent with the vintage
   hypothesis, post-1960s African Americans are relatively better off than
   are pre-1960s African Americans (compared with whites of the same
   cohort). Consistent with the cumulative effects of discrimination model,
   the African American-white wealth gap increases over the life course for
   each historical period. If current patterns persist, presumed gains made
   by young African Americans relative to young whites may turn out to be
   illusory as they progress through the life course.

AB Little research has accounted for how the adult children of Latinx
   im/migrants approach Spanish as part of their ethnoracial identity
   formation and that of their children. Drawing on interviews with
   middle-class Latinxs who grew up poor or working-class, I consider the
   role of language in the social construction of ethnoracial identity
   among Latinxs by exploring the following questions: (1) How do the adult
   children of Latinx im/migrants understand bilingualism and the relevance
   of Spanish for Latinx identity? (2) And what are their perspectives on
   their own children's engagement with Spanish and bilingualism? Findings
   show that language ideologies and Latinx panethnicity inform the
   significance they assign to Spanish, including their desire for their
   children to develop Spanish linguistic skills, as well as their views on
   their own bilingualism and that of their children. Their experiences
   with language ideologies suggest that they consider Spanish a form of
   linguistic capital relevant to claiming a Latinx identity. Latinx
   panethnicity can be understood as constituting a situational pressure
   Latinxs negotiate in their approach to Spanish and bilingualism.

   publications developed claims about panethnicity before the identities
   became widely institutionalized. The findings indicate that despite
   referring to communities with different histories, discussions about
   Asian and Hispanic panethnicity displayed strikingly similar discursive
   patterns. We identify three such analytical patterns - broad
   definitions, prototypes, and group comparison - and theorize about how
   they helped to make new Asian and Hispanic boundaries recognizable. In
   doing so, we develop a new analytical framework for understanding the
   role of cultural and discursive resources in boundary construction and
   suggest how it may be applied beyond the cases examined here.

AB This study assesses the implications of a central component of African
   marriage, bridewealth, for norms constraining wives' reproductive
   autonomy. We treat norms as expectations regarding the reactions of
   community members to a wife. We hypothesize that bridewealth triggers
   the application of norms that constrain women's reproductive autonomy
   and that there are gender differences in those norms. We test our
   hypotheses using a vignette experiment conducted with male and female
   participants in Ghana. The results show that participants expected the
   husband's family and men in the community to react more negatively to a
   noncompliant wife than the wife's family and women in the community.
   Whereas men perceived that everyone in the community adhered to
   bridewealth norms, women expected that men did not adhere to those
   norms. Rather, female participants expected men to evaluate wives
   negatively, even for behaviors that are not traditionally associated
   with bridewealth, suggesting that women live in a more threatening
   environment than men realize. This study contributes to understanding of
   the gender dynamics underlying reproductive decision-making in marriage
   and has implications for the endemic problem of women's not having
   control over their own fertility.

AB Drawing on in-depth interviews and focus groups with 64 poor men of
   color, this article analyzes how a U.S. federally funded "responsible
   fatherhood" program transmitted a discourse of paternal essentiality,
   claiming that fathers as masculine role models uniquely contribute to
   child development. It reveals how, despite lack of evidence that fathers
   make indispensable gendered contributions to parenting, the focus on
   male role modeling resonated for marginalized fathers because it
   characterized them as essential for children's well-being in their
   capacity as men, not economic providers. Using an intersectional lens,
   the promotion of paternal essentiality can be understood as a response
   to the way gender ideologies and race and class inequalities interact to
   shape norms of responsible fatherhood that discount men of color living
   in poverty. This strategy relies, however, on an empirically unsupported
   rationale for fathers' involvement that individualizes the social
   problems attributed to "fatherlessness." This case reveals how racism,
   class exploitation, and patriarchy reciprocally shape
   government-sponsored fatherhood programming and its impact on
   marginalized men's parenting identities.

AB A growing literature examines the extent to which the criminal justice
   system perpetuates poverty and inequality. This research examines how
   anti-homeless laws produce various forms of police interactions that
   fall short of arrest, yet have wide-ranging impacts on the urban poor.
   Our analysis draws on a citywide survey of currently and recently
   homeless people, along with 43 in-depth interviews, to examine and
   reveal the mechanisms through which consistent punitive interactions,
   including move-along orders, citations, and destruction of property,
   systematically limit homeless people's access to services, housing, and
   jobs, while damaging their health, safety, and well-being. Our findings
   also suggest that anti-homeless laws and enforcement fail to reduce
   urban disorder, but create instead a spatial churn in which homeless
   people circulate between neighborhoods and police jurisdictions rather
   than leaving public space. We argue that these laws and their
   enforcement, which affected the majority of study participants,
   constitute a larger process of pervasive penality-consistent punitive
   interactions with state officials that rarely result in arrest, but that
   do material and psychological harm. This process not only reproduces
   homelessness, but also deepens racial, gender, and health inequalities
   among the urban poor.

AB Neighborhood and place are key concerns in prisoner reentry and
   desistance literature. Residential change may serve as a turning point
   for those who want to desist from offending or minimize visibility as a
   "known" offender by law enforcement and neighbors. Yet choices of where
   to live are often dictated more by limited housing options than by
   preferred neighborhood characteristics. In addition, people are more or
   less stably housed upon release, and more or less socially tied to
   places. Still, much of the established research relies on residential
   neighborhood as a construct. I apply the concept of activity spaces, or
   how people use and move about space, to extend our understanding of the
   meaning of place for returning prisoners. Drawing on repeated
   semi-structured interviews with men and women returning to the community
   from a county correctional facility in Boston, I employ a typology of
   three types of activity spaces that are common among this sample:
   neighborhood-anchored, utility- or affective-anchored, and unanchored
   activity spaces. These activity spaces reflected their relationship to
   place and reflect varying levels of connection to a "neighborhood." I
   discuss the implications of these patterns for how we think about the
   impact of neighborhoods and place on reentry.

AB Since its establishment in 1993, the Department of Justice's Office of
   Community-Oriented Policing Services has invested $14 billion into local
   police departments' efforts to improve community relations. Yet in 2015,
   the public's confidence in police reached its lowest point since 1993.
   Drawing on seven years of Chicago Police Board meeting transcripts, this
   article identifies one mechanism why, despite police investment,
   community relations can fail to improve. While community meetings where
   residents present complaints are envisioned as enhancing citizen voice,
   police replied to 74 percent of complaints with literal silence. When
   police were not silent, both police and residents repeated identifiable
   scripts-defined as stylized narratives based on generalized knowledge
   from typical events-that reflected divergent conceptualizations of
   community issues. Police use of silence and scripts are examples of
   "perfunctory policing," where officers superficially comply with
   procedural requirements of a program or practice, but resist substantive
   changes in performance-leaving residents to shoulder the consequences of
   police inaction. As local jurisdictions invest more into closing the gap
   between the government and public, insufficient analysis into how
   initiatives are implemented can legitimize decision-making processes
   that reinforce the pre-existing social order, rendering community
   interactions more procedurally symbolic than substantively productive.

   intervention often seek out pediatric care, medical treatments, and
   prescription medications for their children in ways that seem to
   contradict these views. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 34 parents
   who rejected some or all vaccines for their children, this article
   examines the strategies they use to pharmaceutically manage their
   children's health, even when espousing a larger rejection of
   pharmaceutical interventions like childhood vaccines. Rather than
   treating decision-making as solely an internal process, this article
   shows how medication use results from individual, interactional, and
   institutional contexts, with different mechanisms of encouragement and
   enforcement. Using three illustrative cases, I show how parents manage
   ambivalence, which allows them to accept medication for their children
   as a tool to be deployed as deemed necessary in particular contexts
   while at the same time communicating their rejection of it. I conclude
   with suggestions for how to engage parents around healthcare
   decision-making.

   this makes it possible to differentiate the alternative candidates in a

   with the custom, it had large positive effects. We show (theoretically
   and empirically) that this is because a daughter's education, by
   increasing the amount of money parents receive at marriage, generates an
   additional incentive for parents to educate their daughters. We
   replicate these findings in Zambia, a country that had a similar

AB We analyze a bilateral trade model where the buyer chooses the
   distribution of her valuation for the good. The seller, after observing
   the buyer's distribution but not the realized valuation, makes a
   take-it-or-leave-it offer. If distributions are costless, the price and
   the payoffs of both the buyer and the seller are shown to be 1/e in the
   unique equilibrium outcome. The buyer's equilibrium distribution
   generates a unit-elastic demand, and trade is ex post efficient. These
   properties are shown to be preserved even when different distributions
   are differentially costly as long as the cost is monotone in the
   dispersion of the distribution.

AB When is financial repression-namely, policies that force banks to hold
   government debt-optimal? With commitment, such policies are never
   optimal because they crowd out banks' productive investments. Without
   commitment, they are optimal when governments need to issue unusually
   large amounts of debt, such as during wartime. In such times, repression
   allows governments to credibly issue more debt. Repression increases
   credibility because when banks hold government debt, defaults dilute net
   worth, reduce investment, and are thus costly ex post. Forcing banks to
   hold debt endogenously increases these ex post costs but has ex ante
   costs because doing so crowds out investments.

   the same-sex marriage market that allows for straightforward
   identification of the gains of marriage. We estimate the model with
   2008-12 American Community Survey data on California and find that
   positive assortative mating is weaker for same-sex couples than for
   different-sex couples with respect to age and race. Positive assortative
   mating on education is stronger among female same-sex couples but
   comparable for male same-sex and different-sex couples. As regards labor
   market outcomes, our results suggest that specialization within the

AB We analyze a unique episode in the history of monetary economics, the
   2016 Indian "demonetization." This policy made 86% of cash in
   circulation illegal tender overnight, with new notes gradually
   introduced over the next several months. We present a model of
   demonetization where agents hold cash both to satisfy a cash-in-advance
   constraint and for tax evasion purposes. We test the predictions of the
   model in the cross-section of Indian districts using several novel data
   sets including: the geographic distribution of demonetized and new notes
   for causal inference; night light activity and employment surveys to
   measure economic activity including in the informal sector; debit/credit
   cards and e-wallet transactions data; and banking data on deposit and
   credit growth. Districts experiencing more severe demonetization had
   relative reductions in economic activity, faster adoption of alternative
   payment technologies, and lower bank credit growth. The cross-sectional
   responses cumulate to a contraction in aggregate employment and night
   lights-based output due to the the cash shortage of at least 2
   percentage points and of bank credit of 2 percentage points in 2016Q4
   relative to their counterfactual paths, effects that dissipate over the
   next few months. Our analysis rejects monetary neutrality using a
   large-scale natural experiment, something that is still rare in the vast
   literature on the effects of monetary policy.

AB A widely held view is that openness to international trade leads to
   higher income volatility, as trade increases specialization and hence
   exposure to sector-specific shocks. Contrary to this common wisdom, we
   argue that when country-wide shocks are important, openness to
   international trade can lower income volatility by reducing exposure to
   domestic shocks and allowing countries to diversify the sources of
   demand and supply across countries. Using a quantitative model of trade,
   we assess the importance of the two mechanisms (sectoral specialization
   and cross-country diversification) and show that in recent decades
   international trade has reduced economic volatility for most countries.

AB Informed by social media data collected following four terror attacks in
   the UK in 2017, this article delineates a series of "techniques of

   consequences of misleading information following terror attacks, the
   article contributes empirically to the neglected topic of social
   reactions to terrorism. It also advances scholarship on the workings of
   disinforming communications, by focusing on a domain other than
   political elections, which has been the empirical focus for most studies
   of disinformation to date. Theoretically, the analysis is framed by
   drawing an analogy with Gresham Sykes and David Matza's (1957) account
   of the role of "techniques of neutralization" originally published in
   the American Sociological Review. The connection being that where they
   studied deviant behaviour, a similar analytic lens can usefully be
   applied to disinformation cast as "deviant" information.

AB This article explores the ways in which the white working-class
   residents of a suburban English town reflect on their relationships with
   their British Asian Pakistani Muslim neighbors. Its focus is on how
   everyday constructions of home become sites for the intermingling of
   discourses of intercultural conviviality and racism. My contention is
   that the idea of home has not yet been given the detailed critical
   attention that it deserves in the sociological literature on everyday
   manifestations of multiculturalism, conviviality, and racism. My
   supposition is that a special focus on the idea of home as the site of
   conviviality offers a productive avenue to analyze how intercultural
   relationships are formed and how the norms of neighborliness are thought
   to break down, opening a space for commonplace racialized and racist
   stereotypes to take hold. The idea of home is central to the rhythm and
   landscape of the English suburbs. It conjures up the idea of a uniform
   and aspirational white space. Drawing on this imaginary of home, I shall
   trace how "white working class" "English," "Scottish," and
   "Anglo-Italian" residents' everyday constructions of home become
   embroiled with their relationships with their British Asian Pakistani
   Muslim neighbors.

AB Stop-and-frisk and other punitive policing practices disproportionately
   affect marginalized communities of color. In response to calls for
   reform, police departments have implemented community policing programs
   aimed at improving relations with racialized communities. This study
   examines how a police unit used courtesy and respect in its engagement
   with a criminalized population, gang-associated Latinos, while relying
   on the stop-and-frisk practice. Our study reveals contextual and
   situational contradictions between modern police departments' attempts
   to establish legitimacy and the hegemonic practice of investigatory
   stops. Drawing on observations and interviews conducted during a
   ride-along study, we find that stop-and-frisk, simultaneously used with
   reform practices like courtesy policing, yield a paradoxical policing
   approach, "the legitimacy policing continuum." Officers regularly
   articulate a goal of respectfully interacting with courtesy to build
   community and trust-what we term "the mano suave"-while practicing a
   dominant logic of crime prevention through punitive measures-what we
   term "the mano dura." We argue that community and courtesy policing are
   drawn on strategically in interaction and ultimately intertwined with
   and constrained by the racial bias at the heart of punitive policing
   practices like stop-and-frisk.

AB Sociologists have shown that the relationships people establish between
   moral orientations and market practices vary considerably across
   historical, geographic, and institutional contexts. Less attention has
   been paid to situational variation in how the same actors moralize
   different economic goals, especially in their workplace. This article
   offers an account of situational variation by theorizing the
   implications of the ambiguity of moral values for economic activity. I
   draw on the case of a post-acute care unit, where reimbursement policies
   create the contradictory demands of discharging elderly patients quickly
   while ensuring their safety to avoid re-hospitalization. Using
   ethnography and interviews, I show that the same actors switched between
   different normative evaluations of "independent aging" to legitimize
   divergent organizational goals. A shared understanding of autonomy as
   synonymous with "home" moralized the organizational mission of
   discharging patients off the unit. Expectations that elderly people
   attain independence by acknowledging need for assistance moralized the
   extension of services. Conversely, interpreting independence as a
   constellation of duties to be self-reliant moralized practices that lead
   to fast discharge. Based on these findings, I develop a framework of
   moral polysemy to analyze ambiguity as a resource for cooperation in
   organizations and a tool to expand understanding of moral economies.

AB Examining the economic value of education has been a central research
   agenda of social scientists for decades. However, prior research
   inadequately accounts for the discrepancy between educational
   credentials and skills at both the individual and societal levels. In
   this article, I investigate the link between credentials, skills, and
   labor market outcomes against a background of societal-level educational
   expansion and skills diffusion. Using internationally comparable OECD
   data for approximately 30,000 individuals in 26 countries, I find that
   both credentials and skills generally contribute to occupational and
   monetary rewards. In particular, the premium for credentials far
   outweighs that for skills. This is in contrast to recent arguments that
   skills are the key to economic success. Nevertheless, returns to
   credentials decline in tandem with educational expansion, whereas skills
   retain their premium even as they diffuse in a given society.
   Furthermore, skills diffusion also leads to the diminishing monetary
   return to high credentials. These findings suggest that skills diffusion
   promotes more meritocratic reward allocation via devaluing high
   credentials without explicit depreciation of high skills.

AB This comment reassesses the prominent claim from Desmond, Papachristos,
   and Kirk (2016) (DPK) that 911 calls plummeted-and homicides
   surged-because of a police brutality story in Milwaukee (the Jude
   story). The results in DPK depend on a substantial outlier 47 weeks
   after the Jude story, the final week of data. Identical analyses without
   the outlier final week show that the Jude story had no statistically
   significant effect on either total 911 calls or violent crime 911 calls.
   Modeling choices that do not extrapolate from data many weeks after the
   Jude story-including an event study and "regression discontinuity in
   time"-also find no evidence that calls declined, a consistent result
   across predominantly black neighborhoods, predominantly white
   neighborhoods, and citywide. Finally, plotting the raw data demonstrates
   stable 911 calls in the weeks around the Jude story. Overall, the
   existing empirical evidence does not support the theory that publishing
   brutality stories decreases crime reporting and increases murders.

AB Based on qualitative data of an upper-secondary school in Sweden's

   do not score top can be labeled dyslexic and the social and moral
   consequences of that. I introduce the concept of "consecrating

   diagnosis of members of different social classes. In this way, this

AB Under what conditions will forcibly displaced persons return to their

   show that even displaced persons who have positive feelings toward their
   original location may nevertheless choose to return as regular visitors
   rather than permanent residents unless the location offers attractive
   economic opportunities. Furthermore, we argue that violence can create
   negative emotions not only toward geographic locations of bloodshed but
   also against its perpetrators. After ethnic wars, the displaced may be
   unwilling to return to intermixed locations, exacerbating ethnic
   separation. We study postwar migration among Lebanese Christians
   displaced during the 1980s and identify economic conditions using
   exogenous price shocks for olive oil, a major local export. Among policy
   implications for economic reconstruction and transitional justice, our
   most important insight is that sometimes we should help the displaced in
   their new location rather than induce permanent return to their old

AB Research in social stratification has shown that children from
   working-class backgrounds tend to obtain substantially lower levels of
   educational attainment and lower labor market positions than children
   from higher social class backgrounds. However, we still know relatively
   little about the micro-level processes that account for this empirical
   regularity. Our study examines the roles of two individual-level
   characteristics-cognitive ability and locus of control-in mediating the
   effect of individuals' parental class background on their educational
   attainment and social class position in Britain. We find that cognitive
   ability mediates only about 35% of the total parental class effect on
   educational attainment and only about 20% of the total parental class
   effect on respondents' social class position, net of their educational
   attainment. These findings contradict existing claims that differences
   in the life chances of children from different social class backgrounds
   are largely due to differences in cognitive ability. Moreover, we find
   that although individuals' locus of control plays some role in mediating
   the parental class effect, its role is substantially smaller than the
   mediating role of cognitive ability. We measure individuals' social
   class positions at different points in their careers-at labor market
   entry and at occupational maturity-and find that the mediating roles of
   cognitive ability and locus of control are remarkably stable across
   individuals' working lives.

AB The logic of free-riding expects that individuals will underinvest in
   public goods, but people often behave in ways that are inconsistent with
   this prediction. Why do we observe variation in free-riding behavior?
   This study addresses this question by examining contributions to an
   important international public good-collective defense in military
   alliances. It develops a behavioral theory of free-riding in which the
   beliefs of world leaders are important for explaining investments in
   public goods. The argument holds that leaders with business experience
   make smaller contributions to collective defense because they are
   egoistic and more comfortable relying on a powerful ally for their
   defense. An analysis of defense expenditures in 17 non-U.S. members of
   the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from 1952 to 2014 provides
   evidence consistent with the theory. The findings suggest that leaders
   with business experience are more likely than other heads of government
   to act as self-interested utility maximizers.

   concept of a "policy assemblage" from within a new materialist ontology,
   to interrogate critically four policy perspectives on climate change:
   "liberal environmentalism"; the United Nations policy statements on
   sustainable development; "green capitalism" (also known as "climate
   capitalism") and finally "no-growth economics." A materialist analysis
   of interactions between climate change and policies enables us to
   establish what each policy can do, what it ignores or omits, and
   consequently its adequacy to address environmental sustainability in the
   face of climate change. None, we conclude, is adequate or appropriate to
   address climate change successfully. We then use this conceptual tool to
   establish a "posthuman" policy on climate change. Humans, from this
   perspective, are part of the environment, not separate from or in
   opposition to it, but possess unique capacities that we suggest are now
   necessary to address climate change. This ontology supplies the starting
   point from which to establish sociologically a scientifically, socially,
   and politically adequate posthuman climate change policy. We offer
   suggestions for the constituent elements of such a policy.

AB This paper examines recent street tests of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in
   the UK and makes the case for an experimental approach in the sociology
   of intelligent technology. In recent years intelligent vehicle testing
   has moved from the laboratory to the street, raising the question of
   whether technology trials equally constitute tests of society. To
   adequately address this question, I argue, we need to move beyond
   analytic frameworks developed in 1990s Science and Technology Studies,
   which stipulated "a social deficit" of both intelligent technology and
   technology testing. This diagnosis no longer provides an effective
   starting point for sociological analysis, as real-world tests of
   intelligent technology explicitly seek to bring social phenomena within
   the remit of technology testing. I propose that we examine instead
   whether and how the introduction of intelligent vehicles into the street
   involves the qualification and re-qualification of relations and
   dynamics between social actors. I develop this proposal through a
   discussion of a field study of AV street trials in three cities in the
   UK-London, Milton Keynes, and Coventry. These urban trials were
   accompanied by the claim that automotive testing on the open road will
   enable cars to operate in tune with the social environment, and I show
   how iterations of street testing undo this proposition and compel its
   reformulation. Current test designs are limited by their narrow
   conception of sociality in terms of interaction between cars and other
   road users. They exclude from consideration the relational capacities of
   vehicles and human road users alike-their ability to co-exist on the
   open road. I conclude by making the case for methodological innovation
   in social studies of intelligent technology: by combining social
   research and design methods, we can re-purpose real-world test
   environments in order to elucidate social issues and dynamics raised by
   intelligent vehicles in society by experimental means, and, possibly,
   test society.

AB In much public discourse on immigrants in Western Europe, perceptions
   towards newcomers are discussed in relation to what white national
   majorities think. However, today, new migrants often move into places
   which are already settled by previous migrants. This article
   investigates the local experiences, perceptions, and attitudes towards
   newcomers among long-established ethnic minorities in an area which they
   have made their home, and where they predominate not just in numbers but
   also by way of shops, religious sites, school population, and so on.
   Based on ethnographic fieldwork in East London (UK), it looks at
   long-established ethnic minority residents' attitudes towards newcomers
   from Eastern Europe, and how these are shaped by their own histories of
   exclusion. By bringing together theories on symbolic boundary making
   with the concept of "convivial labor," it shows how experiences of
   stigmatization impact on perceptions of white newcomers, and how these
   perceptions are characterized by a combination of empathy and
   resentment.

AB Governmentality studies and social theories agree that in contemporary
   societies the idea of autonomy is no longer simply an ideal or an
   individual aspiration but a social obligation. In an attempt to clarify
   the meaning of autonomy in this day and age, this paper asks how
   individuals perceive and negotiate the various dimensions of autonomy
   and how this affects the functioning of late-modern institutions. The
   empirical insights derived from a qualitative study provide a
   differentiated picture of how individuals pursue their claims to
   autonomy and comply with institutional demands for autonomy in everyday
   practice. By presenting seven types of late-modern "autonomy managers,"
   the analysis evinces a usurpation of autonomous agency that renders
   individuals the institutional editors of the contemporary
   contradictions, deficits, and tensions that occur in their everyday
   interactions. This comes at the price of notionally free but exhausted
   actors running short of all kinds of resources.

AB This paper examines the emergence of the role of "moral doctors" who
   volunteer in what are called "moral clinics" in Huzhou city. In these
   moral clinics, the characteristics, experiences, and attributes of older
   women, in particular, are highly valued and viewed as being essential to
   the role of the moral doctor. These moral doctors act as moral exemplars
   and conflict mediators in their local communities. Their moral capital
   and professionalism, combined with their gender, age, familial and
   neighborhood attributes, contribute to the accumulation of an affective
   feminized labor which employs the techniques of care, reason, and moral
   fortitude to govern the self and others. We unpack these ethical virtues
   exemplified by moral doctors and nurses in order to show how a
   female-centric "ethic of care" can become a set of techniques in
   governing others. In this paper, we elaborate on the role that these
   moral doctors perform to support the aims of the moral clinics in terms
   of fostering pro-social behavior and moral obligation in local
   communities. We argue that the performance of this type of "moral work"
   is both a mechanism of discipline and a process of self-actualization.
   We contribute to the current literature on "therapeutic governance" in
   China by showing how the non-expert medicalization of social ills by
   moral doctors is incorporated into the reproduction of social control.

AB This paper explores temporal constituents of the female self in terms of
   their role in underpinning ongoing gender inequality. Drawing on the
   work of Simone de Beauvoir and Iris Marion Young, together with
   sociological approaches to ambivalence, I suggest that these temporal
   subjectivities are embodied, arise from the split subjectivity
   associated with woman as simultaneously subject and object, and
   counterpose the neoliberal emphasis on "choice" and agency with a more
   traditional gendered "expectation," or "waiting" style. The dialectic
   between both temporalities, in which neither is hegemonic, results in a
   chronic state of ambivalence which impedes women's ability to fully
   project themselves into the future, a skill significant to planning and
   career ambition and the absence of which suspends women instead in an
   extended present. The paper aims to do two things in particular. In
   conceptual terms it aims to explore aspects of the configuration of the
   gendered self that underlie the stalling and slowing down of the gender
   revolution and which can be seen to provide a "missing link" between
   structures, institutions, and micro-cultures. In empirical terms, it
   suggests a future research agenda, of which this paper constitutes a
   beginning, through which such gendered temporalities can be explored in
   greater detail via ethnographies of women's lived experience of time
   throughout the life course.

AB In theory, granting politicians tools to oversee bureaucrats can reduce
   administrative malfeasance. In contrast, I argue that the political
   control of bureaucrats can increase corruption when politicians need
   money to fund election campaigns and face limited institutional
   constraints. In such contexts, politicians can leverage their
   discretionary powers to incentivize bureaucrats to extract rents from
   the state on politicians' behalf. Using data from an original survey of
   bureaucrats (N = 864) across 80 randomly sampled local governments in
   Ghana, I show that bureaucrats are more likely to facilitate
   politicians' corrupt behavior when politicians are perceived to be
   empowered with higher levels of discretionary control. Using qualitative
   data and a list experiment to demonstrate the mechanism, I show that
   politicians enact corruption by threatening to transfer noncompliant
   officers. My findings provide new evidence on the sources of public
   administrative deficiencies in developing countries and qualify the
   presumption that greater political oversight improves governance.

AB Internationally, sex work research, public opinion, policy, laws, and
   practice are predicated on the assumption that commercial sex is a
   priori sold by women and bought by men. Scarce attention has been
   devoted to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer/questioning
   (LGBTQ) sex working as well as women who pay for sex. This is as much an
   empirical absence as it is a theoretical one, for the ideological claim
   that women comprise the "vast majority" of sex workers is rarely, if
   ever, exposed to empirical scrutiny. Focusing on the UK, we address this
   major gap in evidence in order to challenge the gendered and
   heterosexist logics that underpin contemporary debates. We do so by
   presenting large-scale data gained from the quantitative analysis of
   25,511 registered member profiles of an online escort directory. Our
   findings point to heterogeneity rather than homogeneity in the
   contemporary sex industry including in terms of gender identity, sexual
   orientation, and advertised client base. For example, while two-thirds
   of advertisements self-identify as "Female," one in four are listed as
   "Male;" less than half list their sexual orientation as "Straight;" and
   nearly two-thirds advertise to women clients. Our study thus challenges
   prevailing heteronormative assumptions about commercial sex, which erase
   LGBTQ sex workers and other non-normative identities and practices, and
   which we argue have important political, practical, and theoretical
   consequences.

AB This article expands on my presidential address to further bolster the
   case that sociology has, from its inception, been engaged in social
   justice. I argue that a critical review of our discipline and our
   Association's vaunted empiricist tradition of objectivity, in which
   sociologists are detached from their research, was accomplished by a
   false history and sociology of sociology that ignored, isolated, and
   marginalized some of the founders. In the past half-century,
   scholar-activists, working-class sociologists, sociologists of color,
   women sociologists, indigenous sociologists, and LGBTQ sociologists have
   similarly been marginalized and discouraged from pursuing social justice
   issues and applied research within our discipline. Being ignored by
   academic sociology departments has led them to create or join homes in
   interdisciplinary programs and other associations that embrace applied
   and scholar-activist scholarship. I offer thoughts about practices that
   the discipline and Association should use to reclaim sociology's social

AB This article argues that black workers' perceptions of racial
   discrimination derive not just from being in the minority, but also from
   their position in the organizational structure. Researchers have shown
   that black individuals encounter an enormous amount of racial
   discrimination in the workplace, including but not limited to exclusion
   from critical social networks, wage disparities, and hiring
   disadvantages. But fewer studies examine the extent to which black
   workers believe racial discrimination is a salient factor in their
   occupational mobility or the factors that might explain their divergent
   perceptions of racial discrimination. Based on 60 in-depth interviews
   with black medical doctors, nurses, and technicians in the healthcare
   industry, we show that black workers' status within an organizational
   hierarchy fundamentally informs perceptions of the nature and type of
   workplace racial discrimination. These findings have implications for
   understanding how racial dynamics at work are linked to mental health,
   occupational satisfaction, and organizational change.

   endogenous differentiation in business models. Differentiation is not
   driven by the heterogeneity of agents as in classic works. Rather it

AB How do migrants decide when to leave? Conventional wisdom is that

   However, long-standing problems of violence and poverty often cannot

   decisions in the critical case of Syrian and Iraqi migration to Europe
   using an original survey and embedded experiment, as well as interviews,
   focus groups, and Internet search data. We find that violence and
   poverty lead individuals to invest in learning about the migration
   environment. Political shifts in receiving countries then can unleash
   migratory flows. The findings underscore the need for further research
   on what migrants know about law and politics, when policy changes create
   and end migrant waves, and whether politicians anticipate migratory
   responses when crafting policy.

AB We analyze the factors that increase the likelihood that other nations
   will follow China's global economic leadership. While our theoretical
   framework incorporates the conventional argument that China pulls in
   followers with economic benefits, we focus on grievances with the
   current global order that have the effect ofpushingcountries toward the
   rising new leader. We find that grievances about global financial
   instability are particularly important push factors. Our results show
   that countries that have experienced more financial crises, more
   variable capital account policies, more volatile portfolio capital
   outflows, and more social unrest during IMF programs are more likely to
   support China's global leadership than leaders of nations that have been
   less exposed to these problems. We find no evidence that grievances
   about global governance, or grievances about discriminatory US trade
   policies, are related to foreign support for China's global economic
   leadership. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the interpretation
   that leaders want to reform and preserve the WTO and the IMF, which have
   worked reasonably well for them under US leadership. At the same time,
   they have incentives to follow China's economic leadership on global
   capital flows, emphasizing long-term infrastructure and development
   finance over short-term flows which, under the current order, have
   imposed large costs on many economies.

AB A principal theme of international relations scholarship following the
   Cold War was the apparent erosion of state sovereignty caused by
   globalization's integrative effects and the proliferation of
   international institutions and networks. In recent years, however,
   scholars have noted a reverse trend: the reassertion of traditional, or
   Westphalian, state sovereignty. By contrast, I highlight another recent
   trend that has gone largely overlooked: the reaffirmation of older
   "extralegal" and "organic" versions of sovereignty by three of the
   world's most powerful states-Russia, China, and the United States. After
   tracing the genealogy of these older concepts, I consider how and why
   they have gained prominence in the official discourse of all three
   countries. I also explore the implications of this shift, which not only
   illustrates the importance of "norm retrieval" in international affairs,
   but also raises questions about the foundations of international order.
   Contrary to Westphalian sovereignty, which emphasizes the legal equality
   of states and the principle of noninterference in domestic affairs, the
   extralegal and organic versions offer few constraints on state action.
   If anything, they appear to license powerful states to dominate others.

AB Past studies conclude that a territorial integrity norm caused
   territorial conquest to decline sharply after 1945, virtually subsiding
   after 1975. However, using new and more comprehensive data on
   territorial conquest attempts, this study presents a revised history of
   conquest after 1945. Unlike attempts to conquer entire states, attempts
   to conquer parts of states remained far more common than previously
   recognized. More than conquest declined in frequency, its relationship
   with war evolved. Challengers attempting conquest before 1945 often
   initiated a war, then sought to occupy large territories. Today,
   challengers more often seize small regions, then attempt to avoid war.
   Adopting this strategy, the fait accompli, challengers increasingly came
   to target territories with characteristics that reduce the risk of
   provoking war-such as a low population and the absence of a defending
   military garrison-but challengers nonetheless take a calculated gamble.
   In part because seizures of smaller territories with such
   characteristics have not declined, the operative constraint appears to
   be against war-prone aggression, not territorial revision. The evolution
   of conquest is a symptom of war's decline, not its cause. Most of the
   evidence that the territorial integrity norm suppressed conquest or war
   withers under investigation with new data. Attempts to get away with
   seizing small pieces of territory are likely to be a defining element of
   the twenty-first-century international security landscape.

AB Do rebel group violations of international humanitarian law during civil
   war-in particular, attacks on noncombatant civilians-affect conflict
   outcomes? I argue that in the post-Cold War era, rebel groups that
   donottarget civilians have used the framework of international
   humanitarian law to appeal for diplomatic support from Western
   governments and intergovernmental organizations. However, rebel group
   appeals for international diplomatic support are most likely to be
   effective when the rebel group can contrast its own restraint toward
   civilians with the government's abuses. Rebel groups that donottarget
   civilians in the face of government abuses, therefore, are likely to be
   able to translate increased international diplomatic support into more
   favorable conflict outcomes. Using original cross-national data on rebel
   group violence against civilians in all civil wars from 1989 to 2010, I
   show that rebel groups that exercise restraint toward civilians in the
   face of government violence are more likely to secure favorable conflict
   outcomes. I also probe the causal mechanism linking rebel group behavior
   to conflict outcomes, showing that when a rebel group exercises
   restraint toward civilians and the government commits atrocities,
   Western governments and intergovernmental organizations are more likely
   to take coercive diplomatic action against the government. The evidence

AB What explains variation in individual preferences for foreign economic
   engagement? Although a large and growing literature addresses that
   question, little research examines how partner countries affect public
   opinion on policies such as trade, foreign aid, and investment. We
   construct a new theory arguing that political side-taking by outside
   powers shapes individuals' support for engaging economically with those
   countries. We test the theory using original surveys in the United
   States and Tunisia. In both cases, the potential partner country's
   side-taking in the partisan politics of the respondents' country
   dramatically shapes support for foreign economic relations. As the rise
   of new aid donors, investors, and trade partners creates new choices in
   economic partners, our theory and findings are critical to understanding
   mass preferences about open economic engagement.

AB Contemporary studies of conflict have adopted approaches that minimize
   the importance of negotiation during war or treat it as a constant and
   mechanical activity. This is strongly related to the lack of systematic
   data that track and illustrate the complex nature of wartime diplomacy.
   I address these issues by creating and exploring a new daily-level data
   set of negotiations in all interstate wars from 1816 to the present. I
   find strong indications that post-1945 wars feature more frequent
   negotiations and that these negotiations are far less predictive of war
   termination. Evidence suggests that increased international pressures
   for peace and stability after World War II, especially emanating from
   nuclear weapons and international alliances, account for this trend.
   These original data and insights establish a dynamic research agenda
   that enables a more policy-relevant study of conflict management,
   highlights a historical angle to conflict resolution, and speaks to the
   utility of viewing diplomacy as an essential dimension to understanding
   war.

   learning features of both types of agents in our incomplete information

AB We develop a tractable model of endogenous production networks. Each one
   of a number of products can be produced by combining labor and an
   endogenous subset of the other products as inputs. Different
   combinations of inputs generate (prespecified) levels of productivity
   and various distortions may affect costs and prices. We establish the
   existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium and provide comparative
   static results on how prices and endogenous technology/input choices
   (and thus the production network) respond to changes in parameters.
   These results show that improvements in technology (or reductions in
   distortions) spread throughout the economy via input-output linkages and
   reduce all prices, and under reasonable restrictions on the menu of
   production technologies, also lead to a denser production network. Using
   a dynamic version of the model, we establish that the endogenous
   evolution of the production network could be a powerful force towards
   sustained economic growth. At the root of this result is the fact that
   the arrival of a few new products expands the set of technological
   possibilities of all existing industries by a large amount-that is, if
   there are n products, the arrival of one more new product increases the
   combinations of inputs that each existing product can use from 2n-1 to
   2n, thus enabling significantly more pronounced cost reductions from
   choice of input combinations. These cost reductions then spread to other
   industries via lower input prices and incentivize them to also adopt
   additional inputs.

   countries' stocks of knowledge. The model remains tractable with many

   bilateral trade costs to long-run changes in TFP and individual post-war

   tax records. We document a number of novel results. First, individuals
   earn markedly different average returns on their net worth (a standard
   deviation of 22.1%) and on its components. Second, heterogeneity in
   returns does not arise merely from differences in the allocation of
   wealth between safe and risky assets: returns are heterogeneous even
   within narrow asset classes. Third, returns are positively correlated
   with wealth: moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the net
   worth distribution increases the return by 18 percentage points (and 10
   percentage points if looking at net-of-tax returns). Fourth, individual
   wealth returns exhibit substantial persistence over time. We argue that
   while this persistence partly arises from stable differences in risk
   exposure and assets scale, it also reflects heterogeneity in
   sophistication and financial information, as well as entrepreneurial
   talent. Finally, wealth returns are correlated across generations. We
   discuss the implications of these findings for several strands of the

   distribution. This formula utilizes cross-sectional information to
   transform the unit-specific (quasi) maximum likelihood estimator into an
   approximation of the posterior mean under a prior distribution that
   equals the population distribution of the random coefficients. We show
   that the risk of a predictor based on a nonparametric kernel estimate of
   the Tweedie correction is asymptotically equivalent to the risk of a
   predictor that treats the correlated random effects distribution as
   known (ratio optimality). Our empirical Bayes predictor performs well
   compared to various competitors in a Monte Carlo study. In an empirical
   application, we use the predictor to forecast revenues for a large panel
   of bank holding companies and compare forecasts that condition on actual
   and severely adverse macroeconomic conditions.

AB This paper examines the prices of basic staples in rural Mexico. We
   document that nonlinear pricing in the form of quantity discounts is
   common, that quantity discounts are sizable for basic staples, and that
   the well-known conditional cash transfer program Progresa has
   significantly increased quantity discounts, although the program, as
   documented in previous studies, has not affected unit prices on average.
   To account for these patterns, we propose a model of price
   discrimination that nests those of Maskin and Riley (1984) and Jullien
   (2000), in which consumers differ in their tastes and, because of
   subsistence constraints, in their ability to pay for a good. We show
   that under mild conditions, a model in which consumers face
   heterogeneous subsistence or budget constraints is equivalent to one in
   which consumers have access to heterogeneous outside options. We rely on
   known results to characterize the equilibrium price schedule, which is
   nonlinear in quantity. We analyze the effect of nonlinear pricing on
   market participation as well as the impact of a market-wide transfer,
   analogous to the Progresa one, when consumers are differentially
   constrained. We show that the model is structurally identified from data
   on prices and quantities from a single market under common assumptions.
   We estimate the model using data on three commonly consumed commodities
   from municipalities and localities in Mexico. Interestingly, we find
   that relative to linear pricing, nonlinear pricing is beneficial to a
   large number of households, including those consuming small quantities,
   mostly because of the higher degree of market participation that
   nonlinear pricing induces. We also show that the Progresa transfer has
   affected the slopes of the price schedules of the three commodities we
   study, which have become steeper as consistent with our model, leading
   to an increase in the intensity of price discrimination. Finally, we
   find that a reduced form of our model, in which the size of quantity
   discounts depends on the hazard rate of the distribution of quantities
   purchased in a village, accounts for the shift in price schedules
   induced by the program.

AB Consider a researcher estimating the parameters of a regression function
   based on data for all 50 states in the United States or on data for all
   visits to a website. What is the interpretation of the estimated
   parameters and the standard errors? In practice, researchers typically
   assume that the sample is randomly drawn from a large population of
   interest and report standard errors that are designed to capture
   sampling variation. This is common even in applications where it is
   difficult to articulate what that population of interest is, and how it
   differs from the sample. In this article, we explore an alternative
   approach to inference, which is partly design-based. In a design-based
   setting, the values of some of the regressors can be manipulated,
   perhaps through a policy intervention. Design-based uncertainty emanates
   from lack of knowledge about the values that the regression outcome
   would have taken under alternative interventions. We derive standard
   errors that account for design-based uncertainty instead of, or in
   addition to, sampling-based uncertainty. We show that our standard
   errors in general are smaller than the usual infinite-population
   sampling-based standard errors and provide conditions under which they
   coincide.

AB Two main classes of channels are studied as informational sources of

   and financial links between economies, and the second is a social
   learning channel that arises when agents base their decisions on noisy
   observations about the actions of others in foreign markets. Using
   global games, I present a two-country model of financial contagion in
   which both channels can operate and I test its predictions
   experimentally. The experimental results show that subjects do not
   extract information optimally, which leads to two systematic biases that
   affect these channels directly. Base-rate neglect leads subjects to
   underweight their prior, and thus weakens the fundamental channel. An
   overreaction bias strengthens the social learning channel, since
   subjects rely on information about the behavior of others, even when
   this information is irrelevant. These results have significant welfare
   effects rooted in the specific way in which these biases alter behavior.

AB Policies to mitigate global climate change entail significant economic
   costs. Yet a growing number of firms lobby in favor of regulation to
   mitigate carbon emissions. Why do firms support environmental
   regulations that directly increase production costs? This question is
   all the more puzzling in a globalized economy where regulation may
   undermine the competitiveness of domestic firms at home and abroad. By
   imposing differential costs on participants in the domestic market,
   policies designed to mitigate carbon emissions shift market share toward
   firms with low anticipated adjustment costs. I develop and test a model
   of climate change policymaking in the presence of market competition and
   open borders. Heterogeneity in adjustment costs induces a preference for
   regulation among low-cost firms. Firms facing import pressure-or export
   competition-may prefer stringent regulation if costs are sufficiently
   asymmetric. Firms embedded in global value chains also benefit if
   regulation raises the costs of domestically produced intermediate goods.

AB In international relations, accounts of medieval political authority are
   divided between those who see a heteronomous patchwork of overlapping
   authorities and those who claim that the era of the state started in the
   twelfth century. How can we overcome this divide? I argue that IR's
   current difficulties in grasping the nature of medieval political
   authority stem from shortcomings in how the notion of political
   authority itself has been conceptualized. Thus, rather than starting
   from a substantive definition of political authority, I focus on
   contestation over the categorization and authorization of rule, that is,
   on how authority is produced in historically specific ways as a result
   of contemporary contestation over what political authority is, who is
   authorized, and how rulers stand in relation to one another. This
   reorientation allows us to appreciate how medieval political authority
   emerged from the competition between four sets of ordering categories:
   iurisdictio, potestas, lord/vassal, and magistrate. Each one of these
   four categories understood authority, rulers, and the relation between
   rulers in different ways. The problem with existing accounts of medieval
   authority is that they attempt to find the single ordering principle of
   medieval international relations. In doing so, they not only fail to
   capture the features of the time but also reinforce a particular
   approach to political authority that is unhelpful for understanding
   medieval and modern politics alike.

AB Why do combatants uproot civilians in wartime? In this paper I identify
   cross-national variation in three population-displacement
   strategies-cleansing, depopulation, and forced relocation-and test
   different explanations for their use by state actors. I advance a new
   "assortative" theory to explain forced relocation, the most common type.
   I argue that combatants displace not only to expel undesirable
   populations, but also to identify the undesirables in the first place by
   forcing people to send signals of loyalty and affiliation based on
   whether, and to where, they flee. This makes communities more "legible"
   and facilitates the extraction of rents and recruits. I test these
   arguments using a novel Strategic Displacement in Civil Conflict data
   set (1945-2008). Consistent with my expectations, different displacement
   strategies occur in different contexts and appear to follow different
   logics. Cleansing is more likely in conventional wars, where territorial
   conquest takes primacy, while forced relocation is more likely in
   irregular wars, where identification problems are most acute. The
   evidence indicates that cleansing follows a logic of punishment. The
   results for relocation, however, are consistent with the implications of
   my assortative logic: it is more likely to be employed by
   resource-constrained incumbents fighting insurgencies in "illegible"
   areas-rural, peripheral territories. A case study from Uganda based on
   in-depth fieldwork provides evidence for the assortative mechanism. As
   the most comprehensive analysis of wartime displacement strategies to
   date, this paper challenges some core assumptions about a devastating
   form of contemporary political violence.

AB The current scholarly literature on the international mediation of civil
   wars draws predominantly on a rationalist-materialist perspective. This
   perspective suggests that the ticket to mediation success is the
   material manipulation of the bargaining environment by third parties
   with a high degree of economic and military resources. I argue that
   legitimacy also determines outcomes of mediation because if a mediator
   has legitimacy, it can continue to look for a mutually satisfactory
   outcome and try to pull the conflict parties toward compliance. I show
   that legitimacy matters by systematically comparing the effectiveness of
   African and non-African third parties. African third parties are
   typically considered ineffective because of a low degree of economic and
   military capacity. However, they effectively mediate civil wars in
   Africa because of a high degree of legitimacy, which is a result of a
   strong conviction within the African society of states that African
   mediation is the most desirable type in conflicts there. Drawing on data
   from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program supplemented with unique data,
   which together cover all mediation efforts in Africa between 1960 and
   2017, I find quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of
   African third parties. Compared to non-African ones, African third
   parties are far more likely to conclude negotiated settlements that are
   more likely to be durable. African third parties are especially
   effective if the conflict parties are highly committed to the African
   solutions norm. Theoretically, this study deviates from much of the
   literature that puts forward solely rationalist-materialist explanations
   of mediation success. By bringing legitimacy to the forefront, this
   article supplements the current mediation literature that emphasizes
   material sources of power and ignores social structures.

AB This article contributes to an understanding of why autocrats have
   accepted the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.
   Leveraging their ability to obstruct their own prosecution, autocrats
   have traded off the risk of unwanted prosecutions against the deterrent
   threat that prosecutions pose to political rivals and patrons of their
   enemies conspiring to oust them. The risk of unwanted prosecutions and
   the court's deterrent threat both arise because ICC prosecutions
   credibly communicate guilt for international crimes to
   capital-disbursing democracies, which may, insofar as possible, use
   leader-specific economic statecraft to prevent the administration of
   foreign states by those whom the court signals are guilty of
   international crimes. Analysis using fixed effects and matching shows
   that a greater reliance on capital publicly financed by democracies
   increased the probability that a state accepted the court's jurisdiction
   only when it was an autocracy (1998-2017). ICC jurisdiction also
   lengthened the tenure of autocrats and reduced the severity of civil
   conflict in autocracies.

AB A wave of recent research challenges the role of regime type in
   international relations. One striking takeaway is that democratic and
   autocratic leaders can often achieve similar levels of domestic
   constraint, which in many issue areas results in similar international
   outcomes-leading many to question traditional views of democracies as
   distinctive in their international relations. In this review essay, we
   use recent contributions in the field to build what we call a "malleable
   constraints" framework, in which all governments have an institutionally
   defined default level of domestic audience constraint that is generally
   higher in democracies, but leaders maintain some agency within these
   institutions and can strategically increase their exposure to or
   insulation from this constraint. Using this framework, we argue that
   regime type is still a crucial differentiator in international affairs
   even if, as recent studies suggest, democratic and autocratic leaders
   can sometimes be similarly constrained by domestic audiences and thus
   achieve similar international outcomes. This framework helps reconcile
   many competing claims in recent scholarship, including the puzzle of why
   autocracies do not strategically increase domestic audience constraint
   more often. Just because autocracies can engage audience constraints and
   democracies can escape them does not mean that they can do so with equal
   ease, frequency, or risk.

AB Terrorists attack civilian targets but there is variation in how many
   civilians they kill. Terrorists may deliberately harm civilians, or they
   may adopt a less bloody approach, demolishing businesses, transit
   systems, and other civilian property while employing tactics to avert
   civilian casualties. One such tactic is to warn civilians before an
   attack, allowing them to flee the area. With warnings as an example,
   this study considers why terrorists might adopt casualty-aversion
   tactics. An analysis of 12,235 bombings by 131 terrorist groups in the
   years 1970 to 2016 finds that warnings are most common when terrorists
   fight democracies and when they lack territorial strongholds.
   Ideological factors such as religion are not significant predictors of
   warnings. These findings suggest a need to revisit the claim that
   religion incentivizes indiscriminate terrorism. They also suggest a
   strategic logic behind casualty-aversion tactics. Terrorists fighting
   democracies may spare civilians to appear legitimate in citizens' eyes.
   Terrorists without strongholds may spare civilians because they rely on
   the state's population for support. At first glance, my findings appear
   to contradict civil war literature arguing that militants with
   strongholds use violence more discriminately. However, terrorism occurs
   in areas of state control. Militants with strongholds can use
   indiscriminate terrorism against state-governed civilians without
   alienating their own supporters elsewhere.

AB How do parents weigh police presence and police activity in their
   assessments of a neighborhood's suitability for raising children? How do
   place-bound institutions relate to neighborhood frames? This article
   introduces located institutions as a way of articulating how certain
   institutions-here, the police-become a lens through which parents make
   meaning of places and thus express preferences for particular
   neighborhoods or communities. By drawing from 73 interviews with a
   diverse sample of parents in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, this article shows
   how parents draw on their perceptions of the police as an attractive
   amenity or a public nuisance as a way of articulating neighborhood
   frames and making sense of their residential preferences. More broadly,
   this article envisions the perception of institutions as a key mechanism
   that shapes neighborhood frames and residential preferences.

AB Widespread reliance on credit increasingly defines realities of economic
   citizenship in American society. This article theorizes the racial
   politics of credit expansion. It examines the federal initiative in the
   1960s and '70s to broaden financial access for poor renters in
   communities of color, which unintentionally sparked the rise of new
   state-level credit agencies. Drawing on historical evidence, much of it
   never used before, the author's findings reveal the contentious politics
   at the heart of this policy shift. Doing so highlights the constitutive
   whiteness of credit and also illuminates how the project of expanding
   credit to marginalized groups tests the categorical seams of markets in
   the public imagination: such initiatives fuel racial contestation around
   taken-for-granted market rules, which draws governing officials toward
   increasingly speculative and convoluted financial instruments as a means
   of rule-bending subversion. Ultimately, this article sheds much-needed
   light on, and encourages further research into, the racial
   stratification of the state's market-making power.

AB Many social commentators posit that children's social skills are
   declining as a result of exposure to technology. But this claim is
   difficult to assess empirically because it is challenging to measure
   "social skills" with confidence and because a strong test would employ
   nationally representative data of multiple cohorts. No scholarship
   currently meets these criteria. The authors fill that gap by comparing
   teachers' and parents' evaluations of children's social skills among
   children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study 1998 and 2010
   cohorts. The authors find no evidence that teachers or parents rate
   children's face-to-face social skills as poorer among more recent
   cohorts, even when accounting for family characteristics, screen time
   use, and other factors. In addition, within cohorts, children with heavy
   exposure to screens exhibit similar social skills trajectories compared
   to children with little exposure to screens. There is a notable
   exception-social skills are lower for children who access online gaming
   and social networking many times a day. Overall, however, the results
   represent a challenge to the dominant narrative that social skills are
   declining due to technological change.

AB Social networks affect individuals' ability to solve conflicts between
   individual and collective interests. Indeed, the ability to seek out
   cooperative others is a key explanation for the high levels of
   cooperation observed in social life. In contrast to existing research on
   cooperation and networks, sorting in the real world is typically driven
   by homophily, or similarity on socially significant attributes like
   ethnicity or religion. Here the authors develop and test an argument
   about how homophily alters network dynamics and cooperation using a
   large web-based experiment and an agent-based model. They find that
   homophily promotes cooperation, net of key determinants of cooperation.
   Further, homophily drives the selection of new ties, increasing
   clustering in dynamic networks. The authors also demonstrate the
   consequences of in-group preferences for between-group segregation.
   Their results therefore shed light on how cooperation can evolve in
   networks and how this process contributes to network-level segregation.

   nomination - central to prevailing explanations of empirical patterns in
   women's representation. Moreover, it jointly evaluates how incumbency

   elections to compare a plethora of parties, operating under numerous

AB Why do autocrats hold multiparty elections? This article argues that
   transitions to electoral authoritarianism (EA) follow a strategic
   calculus in which autocrats balance international incentives to adopt
   elections against the costs and risks of controlling them. It tests this
   hypothesis with a multinomial logit model that simultaneously predicts
   transitions to EA and democracy, using a sample of non-electoral
   autocracies from 1946-2010. It finds that pro-democratic international
   leverage - captured by dependence on democracies through trade ties,
   military alliances, international governmental organizations and aid -
   predicts EA adoption. Socio-economic factors that make voters easier to
   control, such as low average income and high inequality, also predict EA
   transition. In contrast, since democratization entails a loss of power
   for autocrats, it is mainly predicted by regime weakness rather than
   international engagement or socio-economic factors. The results
   demonstrate that different forms of liberalization follow distinct
   logics, providing insight into autocratic regime dynamics and democracy
   promotion's unintended effects.

AB How does natural resource extraction affect ethnic violence in a strong
   authoritarian state? This study investigates the effects of oil and
   natural gas development on violent incidents in Xinjiang, China, using
   data from its eighty-six counties. Contrary to the resource curse claim,
   we find that areas with larger quantities of resource production have
   lower rates of violence. The analysis of reserves data confirms that
   this finding is not driven by endogeneity between violence and resource
   production. This soothing effect of resources subsides, however, in
   areas with high mosque density. While we find no supporting evidence
   that drastic ethno-demographic changes or strengthening of public
   security are associated with resource extraction, the analysis shows
   that resource development contributes to improved local economic
   conditions, particularly with respect to employment and the incomes of
   employees of state-owned enterprises.

AB This article draws on the authoritarian institutions literature to
   explain the role of dominant parties in constraining the ability of
   autocrats to reshuffle cabinet ministers. Dominant party leaders are
   constrained in their ability to frequently reshuffle ministers by the
   need to maintain credible power-sharing commitments with party elites.
   These constraints also produce distinct temporal patterns of instability
   where large reshuffles occur following elections. Conversely,
   personalist leaders face fewer power-sharing constraints and engage in
   more extensive cabinet reshuffles at more arbitrary intervals. Military
   leaders face complex constraints that depend on whether officers or
   civilians occupy cabinet posts and the extent to which leaders are
   dependent upon civilian ministers for regime performance and popular
   support. Empirical analyses using data on the cabinets of ninety-four
   authoritarian leaders from thirty-seven African countries between 1976
   and 2010 support the theoretical expectations for dominant party and
   personalist leaders, but are inconclusive for military leaders.

AB Recent theories of foreign aid assume that moral motives drive voters'
   preferences about foreign aid. However, little is known about how moral
   concerns interact with the widely accepted instrumental goals that aid
   serves. Moreover, what effects does this interplay have on preferences
   over policy actions? This article assesses these questions using a
   survey experiment in which respondents evaluate foreign aid policies
   toward nasty recipient regimes (those that violate human rights, rig
   elections, crack down on media, etc.). The results indicate that the
   public does have a strong aversion to providing aid to nasty recipient
   regimes, but that it also appreciates the instrumental benefits that aid
   helps acquire. Contrary to a mainstay assertion in the literature, the
   study finds that moral aversion can largely be reversed if the donor
   government engages more with the nasty country. These findings call into
   question the micro-foundations of recent theories of foreign aid, and
   produce several implications for the aid literature.

AB Prior international political economy public opinion research has
   primarily examined how economic and socio-cultural factors shape
   individuals' views on the flows of goods, people and capital. This
   research has largely ignored whether individuals also care about
   rewarding or punishing foreign countries for their policies on these
   issues. We tested this possibility by administering a series of conjoint
   and traditional survey experiments in the United States and China that
   examined how reciprocity influences opposition to foreign acquisitions
   of domestic companies. We find that reciprocity is an important
   determinant of public opinion on the regulation of foreign investments.
   This suggests the need to consider the policies that other countries

AB Are welfare state reforms electorally dangerous for governments?
   Political scientists have only recently begun to study this seemingly
   simple question, and existing work still suffers from two shortcomings.
   First, it has never tested the reform-vote link with data on actual
   legislative decisions for enough points in time to allow robust
   statistical tests. Secondly, it has failed to take into account the many
   expansionary reforms that have occurred in recent decades. Expansions
   often happen in the same years as cutbacks. By focusing only on
   cutbacks, estimates of the effects of reforms on government popularity
   become biased. This article addresses both shortcomings. The results
   show that voters punish governments for cutbacks, but also reward them
   for expansions, making so-called compensation, a viable blame-avoidance
   strategy. The study also finds that the size of punishments and rewards
   is roughly the same, suggesting that voters' well-documented negativity
   bias does not directly translate into electoral behavior.

AB Various theories of democratic governance posit that citizens should
   vote for incumbent politicians when they provide good service, and vote
   for the opposition when service delivery is poor. But does electoral
   accountability work as theorized, especially in developing country
   contexts? Studying Southern African democracies, where infrastructural
   investment in basic services has expanded widely but not universally, we
   contribute a new empirical answer to this question. Analyzing the
   relationship between service provision and voting, we find a surprising
   negative relationship: improvements in service provision predict
   decreases in support for dominant party incumbents. Though stronger in
   areas where opposition parties control local government, the negative
   relationship persists even in those areas where local government is run
   by the nationally dominant party. Survey data provide suggestive
   evidence that citizen concerns about corruption and ratcheting
   preferences for service delivery may be driving citizen attitudes and
   behaviors. Voters may thus be responsive to service delivery, but
   perhaps in ways that are more nuanced than extant theories previously
   recognized.

AB Ethnic diversity is generally associated with less social capital and
   lower levels of trust. However, most empirical evidence for this
   relationship is focused on generalized trust, rather than more
   theoretically appropriate measures of group-based trust. This article
   evaluates the relationship between ethnic diversity - at the national,
   regional and local levels - and the degree to which coethnics are
   trusted more than non-coethnics, a value referred to here as the
   'coethnic trust premium'. Using public opinion data from sixteen African
   countries, this study finds that citizens of ethnically diverse states
   express, on average, more ethnocentric trust. However, within countries,
   regional ethnic diversity is associated with less ethnocentric trust.
   This same negative pattern between diversity and ethnocentric trust
   appears across districts and enumeration areas within Malawi. The
   article then shows, consistent with these patterns, that diversity is
   only detrimental to intergroup trust at the national level when ethnic
   groups are spatially segregated. These results highlight the importance
   of the spatial distribution of ethnic groups on intergroup relations,
   and question the utility of micro-level studies of interethnic
   interactions for understanding macro-level group dynamics.

   polarization, this article hypothesizes that egalitarianism and moral

   partisanship in that the latter relationship will have increased over
   time only among individuals who maintain conservative value
   orientations. An analysis of pooled American National Election Studies
   surveys from 1988 to 2012 supports this hypothesis. The results enhance
   scholarly understanding of the role of core values in shaping mass

AB Why do some government formation periods end after a few days, while

   literature on government formation, surprisingly little is known about
   the underlying bargaining processes. This article introduces a new
   dataset on 303 bargaining attempts in nineteen European democracies to
   analyse the duration of individual bargaining rounds. The study
   hypothesizes that (1) preference tangentiality, (2) ideological
   proximity, (3) incumbency and (4) party leadership tenure decrease the
   duration of coalition bargaining. Employing a copula approach to account
   for the non-random selection process of the observations, it shows that
   these actor-specific factors matter in addition to systemic context
   factors such as post-election bargaining and party system complexity.
   These findings highlight the need to consider both actor-specific and
   systemic factors of the bargaining context to explain government
   formation.

AB Several studies provide evidence of group-centric policy attitudes, that
   is, citizens evaluating policies based on linkages with visible social
   groups. The existing literature generally points to the role of media
   imagery, rhetoric and prominent political sponsors in driving
   group-centric attitudes. This article theorizes and tests an alternative
   source: exposure to rising local ethnic diversity. Focusing on the issue
   of crime, it first develops a theoretical account of how casual
   observation in the local context can give rise to ethnic stereotypes.
   Then, using two large, nationally representative datasets on citizen
   group and policy attitudes linked with registry data on local ethnic
   diversity, each spanning 20 years, it shows that crime attitudes become

AB How does wartime exposure to ethnic violence affect the political
   preferences of ordinary citizens? Are high-violence communities more or
   less likely to reject the politicization of ethnicity post-war? We argue
   that community-level experience with wartime violence solidifies ethnic
   identities, fosters intra-ethnic cohesion and increases distrust toward
   non-co-ethnics, thereby making ethnic parties the most attractive
   channels of representation and contributing to the politicization of
   ethnicity. Employing data on wartime casualties at the community level
   and pre- as well as post-war election results in Bosnia, we find strong
   support for this argument. The findings hold across a number of
   robustness checks. Using post-war survey data, we also provide evidence
   that offers suggestive support for the proposed causal mechanism.

AB What explains citizens' willingness to fight for their country in times
   of war? Using six waves of the World Values Survey, this study finds
   that individual willingness to fight is negatively related with
   country-level income inequality. When income inequality is high, the
   rich are less willing to fight than the poor. When inequality is low,
   the poor and rich differ little in their willingness to fight. This
   change in the willingness to fight between low and high inequality
   countries is greater among the rich than among the poor. This article
   explores several explanations for these findings. The data are
   consistent with the argument that high inequality makes it more
   attractive for the rich to buy themselves out of military service.

AB IMF loans during times of financial crisis often occur in conjunction
   with bilateral financial rescues. These bilateral bailouts are
   substantial in size and a central component of international cooperation
   during financial crises. We analyze the political economy of bilateral
   bailouts and study the trade-offs that potential creditor governments
   experience when other countries find themselves in financial distress.
   Creditor governments want to stabilize crisis countries by providing
   additional liquidity, particularly if the crisis country is economically
   or politically important to them, but they are constrained by domestic
   politics. Politicians aim to balance these countervailing pressures.
   They provide bailouts when their own economy is exposed to negative
   spillover effects and when the crisis country is important for
   geostrategic, military, or political reasons. Domestic economic and
   political constraints, on the other hand, limit their ability to bail
   out other countries. We test our hypotheses using an original data set
   on bilateral bailouts by the G7 countries to countries that experienced
   financial crises between 1975 and 2010. The findings of our statistical
   analysis support our theoretical argument and contribute to a deeper
   understanding of international cooperation's complex structure during
   financial crises.

AB Managing foreign affairs is in no small measure about anticipating the
   actions (and non-actions) of others, and about taking steps to limit the
   unexpected-and the undesired. Law has long been recognized as important
   to these tasks. Nevertheless, standard IR treatments often overlook
   important properties of law, even when trying to account for
   international law's effects on behavior. Chief among these overlooked
   properties is the fact that legal rules are formulated for general use,
   which means their provisions lack determinate meaning in relation to the
   full range of facts they may be applied to. Selecting and using legal
   rules to guide or assess behavior thus requires interpretation.
   Self-interested actors may differ regarding the applicability, scope, or
   meaning of individual rules, and still more so where multiple legal
   rules are in play. In situations where political stakes are high,
   powerful actors may not be content to leave all options on the table.
   Instead they may use interpretative tactics to mingle obligations from
   different agreements and, where needed, to augment relevant legal
   obligations in efforts to prospectively ensure, in the mode of Riker's
   heresthetics, that interlocutors feel compelled by legal circumstances
   to enact the more powerful actor's preferences. I demonstrate how
   agreement mingling and augmentation function in complex legal
   environments by reexaming US efforts to insulate its citizens from
   unwanted exercises of jurisdiction by the International Criminal Court
   (ICC).

AB Canonical models of costly signaling in international relations (IR)
   tend to assume costly signals speak for themselves: a signal's
   costliness is typically understood to be a function of the signal, not
   the perceptions of the recipient. Integrating the study of signaling in
   IR with research on motivated skepticism and asymmetric updating from
   political psychology, we show that individuals' tendencies to embrace
   information consistent with their overarching belief systems (and
   dismiss information inconsistent with it) has important implications for
   how signals are interpreted. We test our theory in the context of the
   2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran, combining two
   survey experiments fielded on members of the American mass public. We
   find patterns consistent with motivated skepticism: the individuals most
   likely to update their beliefs are those who need reassurance the least,
   such that costly signals cause polarization rather than convergence.
   Successful signaling therefore requires knowing something about the
   orientations of the signal's recipient.

AB Many theories of international relations assume that public opinion
   exerts a powerful effect on foreign policy in democracies. Previous
   research, based on observational data, has reached conflicting
   conclusions about this foundational assumption. We use experiments to
   examine two mechanisms-responsiveness and selection-through which
   opinion could shape decisions about the use of military force. We tested
   responsiveness by asking members of the Israeli parliament to consider a
   crisis in which we randomized information about public opinion.
   Parliamentarians were more willing to use military force when the public
   was in favor and believed that contravening public opinion would entail
   heavy political costs. We tested selection by asking citizens in Israel
   and the US to evaluate parties/candidates, which varied randomly on many
   dimensions. In both countries, security policy proved as electorally
   significant as economic and religious policy, and far more consequential
   than nonpolicy considerations such as gender, race, and experience.
   Overall, our experiments in two important democracies imply that
   citizens can affect policy by incentivizing incumbents and shaping who
   gets elected.

AB How do international observers decide whether to criticize or condone
   electoral fraud in a country? We argue that this decision depends on the
   identity of the victims of electoral fraud. A monitoring organization is
   more likely to overlook fraud committed against groups that are deemed
   dangerous by its sponsor. Based on this insight, we hypothesize that in
   the post-Cold War era election monitors are more tolerant of fraud
   against Islamic challengers, especially when Islamic movements are
   perceived as a threat to political stability. In support of our
   hypothesis, we find that outside monitors are more likely to endorse an
   election in countries with an Islamic opposition party and an ongoing
   Islamist terrorist campaign. Furthermore, we find that the effect is
   driven by Western monitoring organizations and becomes stronger after
   the September 11 attacks. Our findings provide a simple yet powerful
   insight: the calculus of outside observers depends not only on who they
   wish to see in power, but also who they want to keep from power.

AB Since trade must cross borders, to what extent do border walls affect

   the objective is to only stem illicit flows, border walls heighten
   "border effects" that can also inhibit legal cross-border flows. Using a
   gravity model of trade that reflects recent developments in both
   economic theory and econometrics, we find that the creation of a wall is
   associated with a reduction in legal trade flows between neighboring
   countries. We provide a battery of evidence that suggests this reduction
   is not simply a function of worsening bilateral relations. Our findings
   have implications for understanding how governments have taken measures
   to assert sovereign control of their borders in an age of increasing

AB Recent theoretical debates have questioned the compatibility of

   cosmopolitan theory. In response, several authors claim that a
   cosmopolitan patriotism is both possible and desirable. In this article,
   we propose two desiderata for cosmopolitan patriotism as a civic ideal,
   which existing accounts fail to meet. First, arguments for cosmopolitan
   patriotism should provide an account of collective identification,
   supporting the relation between the actions of one's country and one's
   appropriate reactive attitudes. Second, such a theory should be able to
   explain the patriot's commitment to critical engagement with her
   country's actions. We then offer a critical appraisal of two accounts
   linking patriotism with global responsibility-Permissible Partialism and
   Globally Responsible Nationalism--and demonstrate how they fall short.
   Finally, we propose an account of civic republican patriotism, which
   better explains how cosmopolitanism and patriotism can be brought

   participation in performing arts, reading interest and participation in
   athletics and clubs. We find that (1) none of the three aspects of

   children's academic skills; (2) reading interest has a direct positive
   effect on educational performance; and (3) the direct effect of reading

   Instead, they suggest that cultural capital fosters skills in children

AB The increased comparative research on perceptions of public welfare
   deservingness studies the extent to which different subgroups of
   citizens are deemed worthy or unworthy of receiving help from the
   welfare state. The concept of deservingness criteria plays a crucial
   role in this research, as it theorizes a universal heuristic that
   citizens apply to rank people in terms of their welfare deservingness.
   Due to the mainly quantitative nature of the research and despite the
   indisputable progress it has made, the subjective existence and actual
   application of these deservingness criteria remain a bit of a black box.
   What criteria of deservingness do citizens actually apply, and how do
   they apply them? This article opens the black box of welfare
   deservingness and sheds light on the nature and practice of
   deservingness criteria. Empirically, the paper explores how the
   deservingness of immigrants is discussed and established within 20 focus
   groups conducted in Slovenia, Denmark, UK, and Norway in 2016 with a
   total of 160 participants. All 20 focus groups discussed the welfare
   deservingness of immigrants based on similar vignette stimuli. Our
   analysis shows that (1) deservingness criteria are used both to
   construct images of target groups and as normative yardsticks; (2)
   deservingness criteria do not work independently of each other, but
   rather co-function in specific hybridized discourses; and (3) the moral
   logic of deservingness is supplemented by alternative moral logics, at
   least in the case of migrants.
