AB Did the American public become more protectionist during the Great
   Recession of 2007-09? If so, why? During this period, many observers
   expressed concern that rising unemployment would stimulate protectionist
   pressures. The results of this study indicate that although increased
   unemployment did not affect the trade preferences of most Americans,
   individuals working in import-competing industries who lost their jobs
   during the Great Recession did grow more hostile to trade. However, even
   greater hostility to trade stemmed from a variety of non-material
   factors. Increasing ethnocentrism and opposition to involvement in world
   affairs between 2007 and 2009 help account for growing antipathy toward
   trade. But most importantly, increasing anxiety that foreign commerce
   would harm people in the future, even if it had not done so thus far,
   contributed to mounting opposition to trade among the American public.

   that are available to counter them. It examines two justifications of
   state support for science: Vannevar Bush's vision of the universal
   material benefits of scientists pursuing basic research and John Rawls's
   liberal justification of science funding as a voluntary public good. It
   argues that both accounts neglect the important political impact of
   scientific research and its status as the source of knowledge for the

   effects indicate that the later political generation is even more
   right-authoritarian, including with respect to attitudes to

AB Coalition governance requires parties to come to collective policy
   decisions while simultaneously competing for votes. This reality has
   inspired a vibrant literature on coalition policy making, which is
   focused on legislative organization and behavior, though it is not clear
   how it affects the electorate. This article addresses this gap in the
   literature by examining how voters' perceptions of compromise in
   coalition policy making affect their vote choices. Analyzing data from
   six parliamentary democracies where multiparty governance is the norm,
   it finds that voters punish parties they view as compromising. More
   specifically, voters are found to discount the policy accomplishments
   and policy promises of compromising parties, and that this tendency is
   more pronounced among previous incumbent cabinet supporters and the
   politically disinterested. These findings have important implications
   for the study of voting as well as coalition policy making.

AB Existing research suggests that voters tend to respond positively to
   legislator independence due to two types of mechanism. First, dissent
   has an indirect effect, increasing a legislator's media coverage and
   personal recognition among constituents (profile effects). Secondly,
   constituents react positively to dissent when this signals that the
   legislator has matching political or representational preferences
   (conditional evaluation). This article presents a third effect: dissent
   acts as a valence signal of integrity and trustworthiness. Consistent
   with the valence signalling mechanism, it uses new observational and
   experimental evidence to show that British voters have a strong and
   largely unconditional preference for legislators who dissent. The
   findings pose a dilemma for political systems that rely on strong and

   polling station data on fraud and violence during Ghana's 2012
   elections, it shows that observers reduced fraud and violence at the
   polling stations which they monitored. It is argued that local electoral
   competition shapes party activists' response to observers. As expected,
   in single-party dominant areas, parties used their local political
   networks to relocate fraud to polling stations without an election
   observer, and, in contrast, party activists relocated violence to
   stations without observers in competitive areas - a response that
   requires less local organizational capacity. This highlights how local
   party organization and electoral incentives can shape the manipulative

AB Although ideological polarization can create problems for governability
   and democratic stability, this article argues that it also has
   beneficial effects in new democracies. By clarifying the political
   alternatives, polarization creates strong links between parties and
   voters, and thereby instills accountability mechanisms that force
   parties to remain responsive to evolving voter preferences. A
   comparative historical analysis of six South American cases demonstrates
   that the vast differences in the quality of representation in the 1980s,
   immediately after many countries in the region returned to democracy,
   were rooted in an early bifurcation of party systems in the first half
   of the twentieth century: while prolonged periods of ideological
   conflict occurred in some countries during this period, polarization was
   aborted by various means in others. By showing that ideological
   moderation may help formal democracies survive, but that aborting
   conflict in the long run severely hampers key aspects of the quality of
   democracy, this study suggests a revision of conventional views
   regarding ideological polarization.

   effects of government-sponsored transparency websites, and the
   information revealed by those efforts, on attitudes about the Peruvian
   political system? Like many developing countries, Peru lacks much system
   support, making it more difficult to improve governance and democracy;
   transparency itself has little impact on political attitudes. However,
   some dimensions of the information provided by transparency matter:
   endorsement by a credible third party or framing that associates
   comparatively good community well-being with government performance.
   These conditions substantively increase Peruvians' approval of the
   national political community, the regime's performance, institutions,
   and local government.

AB Political competition is expected to become less particularistic as
   prosperity rises and a middle class emerges. But particularistic
   linkages persist despite rising wealth in urban Ghana. Politicians are
   unable to commit to campaign promises with voters who want large-scale
   public policies, many of whom are in the middle class. This creates
   incentives to avoid mobilizing many of these voters and to ignore their
   preferences. As a result, voters who want major public policies rather
   than patronage differentially refrain from participation, allowing
   poorer voters to dominate the electorate and party organizations. This
   may only reinforce politicians' disincentives to make policy appeals,
   and stall the emergence of more policy-based electoral competition even
   as the middle class grows.

   television in Norway in the 1960s and 1970s are combined with
   municipality-level data on voter turnout over a period of four decades.
   The date of access to TV signals was mostly a side effect of geography,
   a feature that is used to identify causal effects. Additional analyses
   exploit individual-level panel data from three successive election
   studies. The new TV medium instantly became a major source of political
   information. It triggered political interest and caused a modest, but

   This article explores the empirical question of whether the American
   findings are applicable to Europe. It combines existing European studies
   and presents two new Danish studies to show that the pooled point
   estimate of the effect is substantially smaller in Europe than in the
   United States, and finds no effects in the two Danish experiments. The
   article discusses why the effects seem to be different in Europe
   compared to the United States, and stresses the need for further
   experiments in Europe as there is still considerable uncertainty
   regarding the European effects. While one possible explanation is that
   differences in turnout rates explain the differences in effect sizes,
   the empirical analysis finds no strong relationship between turnout and
   effect sizes in either Europe or the United States.

   democratic peace and the territorial peace and examines the empirical
   record to see which is more accurate. It finds that almost all
   contiguous dyads settle their borders before they become joint
   democracies. Furthermore, the majority of non-contiguous dyad members
   also settle their borders with all neighboring states before their
   non-contiguous dyad becomes jointly democratic. Such findings are
   consistent with the theoretical expectations of the territorial peace,
   rather than the democratic peace. They also weaken a core argument of
   the democratic peace, for this analysis finds that one reason democratic
   dyads may handle their disputes more peacefully than non-democratic
   dyads is not because of their institutions or norms, but rather because
   they have dispensed with the disputes most likely to involve the use of

   parties', especially mainstream ones. This article develops a model to
   explain empirical variation in parties' evaluations of democratic
   institutions, based on two mechanisms: first, that parties' regime
   access affects their regime support, which, secondly, is moderated by
   over-time habituation to democracy. Using expert surveys of all
   electorally significant parties in twenty-four European countries in
   2008 and 2013, the results show that parties evaluate institutions
   positively when they have regular access to a regime, regardless of
   their ideology and the regime's duration. Moreover, regime duration
   affects stances indirectly by providing democracies with a buffer
   against an incumbent's electoral defeat in the most recent election. The
   findings point to heightened possibilities for parties to negatively
   evaluate democracies given the increased volatility in party systems in
   Europe.

AB A long tradition of studies in political science has unveiled the
   effects of electoral institutions on party systems and parliamentary
   representation. Yet their effects on campaign activities remain
   overlooked. Research in this tradition still lacks a strong comparative
   element able to explore the nuanced role of electoral institutions in
   shaping individual-level campaigns during first-order parliamentary
   elections. This study uses data from a variety of national candidate
   studies to address this lacuna, and shows that the structure of
   electoral institutions affects the electoral mobilization efforts put in
   place by candidates. Candidate-centred electoral systems incentivize
   more intense and complex mobilization efforts, and shift the campaign
   focus towards individuals rather than parties. By directly addressing
   the effects of electoral institutions on campaign behaviour, this study
   contributes to the wider debate on their role in promoting political
   engagement and mobilization. These results indicate that electoral
   institutions affect political competition much more than previously
   thought.

AB East Europeans are integrating into life in the UK. This entails
   learning to get along with their new neighbours, but it also involves
   not getting along with certain neighbours. Integration is not confined
   to benevolent forms of everyday cosmopolitanism, multiculturalism and
   conviviality; it can also include more pathological forms, like racism.
   Whilst integration is generally seen as desirable, the learning that it
   entails necessarily includes less desirable practices and norms. The aim
   of this article is to show how East Europeans in the UK have been
   acquiring specifically British competencies of racism. This doesn't mean
   all East Europeans are racist or they always use racism; it does mean,
   however, that racism is a part of the integration equation. We focus on
   the racist and racializing practices of Poles, Hungarians and Romanians
   in Bristol in the UK. These East Europeans are using racism to insert
   themselves more favourably into Britain's racialized status hierarchies.
   This is a kind of integration.

AB Since the early 2000s several European countries have introduced
   language and citizenship tests as new requirements for access to
   long-term residence or naturalization. The content of citizenship tests
   has been often presented as exclusionary in nature, in particular as it
   is based on the idea that access to citizenship has to be 'deserved'. In
   this paper, we aim to explore the citizenship tests 'from below',
   through the focus on the experience of migrants who prepare and take the
   'Life in the UK' test, and with particular reference to how they relate
   to the idea of 'deservingness'. Through a set of in-depth interviews
   with migrants in two different cities (Leicester and London), we show
   that many of them use narratives in which they distinguish between the
   'deserving citizens' and the 'undeserving Others' when they reflect upon
   their experience of becoming citizens. In so doing, they negotiate new
   hierarchies of inclusion into and exclusion from citizenship, which
   reflect broader neo-liberal and ethos-based conceptions of citizenship.

AB The paper is based on original empirical research into the lifestyle
   migration of European migrants, primarily British, to Thailand and
   Malaysia, and of Hong Kong Chinese migrants to Mainland China. We
   combine strong structuration theory (SST) with Heideggerian
   phenomenology to develop a distinctive approach to the interplay between
   social structures and the lived experience of migrants. The approach
   enables a rich engagement with the subjectivities of migrants, an
   engagement that is powerfully enhanced by close attention to how these
   inner lives are deeply interwoven with relevant structural contexts. The
   approach is presented as one that could be fruitfully adopted to explore
   parallel issues within all types of migration. As is intrinsic to
   lifestyle migration, commitment to a better quality of life is central
   to the East Asian migrants, but they seek an uncomplicated, physically
   enhanced texture of life, framed more by a phenomenology of prosaic
   well-being than of self-realization or transcendence. In spite of
   possessing economic and status privileges due to their relatively elite
   position within global structures the reality for a good number of the
   lifestyle migrants falls short of their prior expectations. They are
   subject to particular kinds of socio-structural marginaliszation as a
   consequence of the character of their migration, and they find
   themselves relatively isolated and facing a distinct range of
   challenges. A comparison with research into various groups of migrants
   to the USA brings into relief the specificities of the socio-structural
   positioning of the lifestyle migrants of the study. Those East Asian
   migrants who express the greatest sense of ease and contentment seem to
   be those who have responded creatively to the specific challenges of
   their socio-structural situation. Often, this appears to have been
   achieved through understated but active involvements with their new
   settings and through sustaining focused transnational connections and
   relationships.

   interactions between gender and ethnic groups, which we argue derive
   from the growing diversity of these groups. While we critique the
   concept of superdiversity, we suggest that increased diversity leads to
   a 'diversification of inequality'. This is characterised by an
   increasing incidence of inequality through the growth in migration and
   of the size and variety of ethnic minorities, and by a weakening of
   specific inequalities. We demonstrate this using the Labour Force Survey
   and conclude that there is a clear diversification of inequality but
   also that ethnicity is a more potent source of inequality than gender.
   Diversity also increases the reach of inequality through producing and
   increasing the number of intersections.

AB The 'Flynn effect' describes the substantial and long-standing increase
   in average cognitive ability test scores, which has been observed in
   numerous psychological studies. Flynn makes an appeal for researchers to
   move beyond psychology's standard disciplinary boundaries and to
   consider sociological contexts, in order to develop a more comprehensive
   understanding of cognitive inequalities. In this article we respond to
   this appeal and investigate social class inequalities in general
   cognitive ability test scores over time. We analyse data from the
   National Child Development Study (1958) and the British Cohort Study
   (1970). These two British birth cohorts are suitable nationally
   representative large-scale data resources for studying inequalities in
   general cognitive ability. We observe a large parental social class
   effect, net of parental education and gender in both cohorts. The
   overall finding is that large social class divisions in cognitive
   ability can be observed when children are still at primary school, and
   similar patterns are observed in each cohort. Notably, pupils with
   fathers at the lower end of the class structure are at a distinct
   disadvantage. This is a disturbing finding and it is especially
   important because cognitive ability is known to influence individuals
   later in the lifecourse.

AB Most understandings of the ways classes become social groupings centre
   on processes of mobility closure whereby mutual appreciation and
   recognition within classes arise from homogenous experiences over time.
   The mapping of such structured biographies, however, remains
   understudied. This paper explores intra- and intergenerational mobility
   patterns in the upper strata of the Norwegian class structure and aims
   to include temporal processes and multiple forms of capital in the
   quantification of class trajectories. By combining multiple
   correspondence analysis and social sequence analysis, two important but
   often neglected aspects of recruitment to the upper class are
   emphasized: first, by introducing multiple forms of capital, different
   ways of maintaining mobility closure are demonstrated; second, different
   pathways to power are highlighted by distinguishing between divergent
   class careers. A key aim of the analysis is to explore internal
   divisions within the upper class in forms of parental capital (an
   'origin space') and link these divisions to a typology of 'destination
   careers' in adulthood. The analysis suggests that individuals from
   modest origins are more likely to have careers that feature a
   biographically late arrival and/or short-term affiliations to
   upper-class positions whereas individuals from families rich in capital
   are more likely to have stable careers in the upper-class fractions from
   which they originate. The analysis thus reveals important divisions in
   the trajectories of Norwegians who reach the upper class; not only are
   there differences in their upbringing in terms of the availability of
   different amounts and types of capital but such divisions also seem
   linked to their own class careers later in adulthood.

AB The literature on preferences for redistribution has paid little
   attention to the effect of social mobility on the demand for
   redistribution and no systematic test of the hypotheses connecting
   social mobility and preferences for redistribution has yet been done to
   date. We use the diagonal reference model to estimate the effect of
   origin and destination classes on preferences for redistribution in a
   large sample of European countries using data from the European Social
   Survey. Our findings are consistent with the logic of acculturation in
   the sense that newcomers tend to adapt their views to those of the
   destination class at early stages and that upward and downward mobility
   do not have distinctive effects on the formation of political
   preferences. However, even though social origins seem to have a limited
   impact on preferences for redistribution, the evidence does not support
   the hypothesis that mobile and non-mobile individuals are alike. We also
   find that the effect of social origin on preferences varies largely
   across countries. The empirical evidence leads to the conclusion that
   the effect of social origin on preferences for redistribution increases
   in contexts of strong familism.

AB In this article we use qualitative interviews to examine how Norwegians
   possessing low volumes of cultural and economic capital demarcate
   themselves symbolically from the lifestyles of those above and below
   them in social space. In downward boundary drawing, a range of types of
   people are regarded as inferior because of perceived moral and aesthetic
   deficiencies. In upward boundary drawing, anti-elitist sentiments are
   strong: people practising resource-demanding lifestyles are viewed as
   harbouring 'snobbish' and 'elitist' attitudes. However, our analysis
   suggests that contemporary forms of anti-elitism are far from absolute,
   as symbolic expressions of privilege are markedly less challenged if
   they are parcelled in a 'down-to-earth' attitude. Previous studies have
   shown attempts by the privileged to downplay differences in cross-class
   encounters, accompanied by displays of openness and down-to-earthness.
   Our findings suggest that there is in fact a symbolic 'market' for such
   performances in the lower region of social space. This cross-class
   sympathy, we argue, helps naturalize, and thereby legitimize, class
   inequalities. The implications of this finding are outlined with
   reference to current scholarly debates about politics and populism,
   status and recognition and intersections between class and gender in the
   structuring of social inequalities. The article also contributes key
   methodological insights into the mapping of symbolic boundaries.
   Challenging Lamont's influential framework, we demonstrate that there is
   a need for a more complex analytical strategy rather than simply
   measuring the 'relative salience' of various boundaries in terms of
   their occurrence in qualitative interview data. In distinguishing
   analytically between usurpationary and exclusionary boundary strategies,
   we show that moral boundaries in particular can take on qualitatively
   different forms and that subtypes of boundaries are sometimes so tightly
   intertwined that separating them to measure their relative salience
   would neglect the complex ways in which they combine to engender both
   aversion to and sympathies for others.

AB Previous studies on major East Asian societies such as Japan and Korea
   generally fail to find a strong effect of cultural capital in
   educational inequality, partly due to the characteristic extreme focus
   on standardized test and curriculum. This study shifts attention to the
   horizontal stratification of education by investigating the association
   between family background, cultural capital, and college major choice in
   contemporary China. Based on analysis of data from the Beijing College
   Students Panel Survey (BCSPS), we found that, on average, cultural
   capital significantly mediates the relationship between family
   background and college major preference. Those with greater endowment of
   cultural capital are more likely to come from socio-economically
   advantaged families, and, at the same time, demonstrate a stronger
   propensity to major in liberal arts fields rather than science,
   technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Further analyses
   reveal that the association between cultural capital and academic field
   choice comes into being by way of performance in the Chinese test in the
   national college entrance examination and of the non-cognitive
   dispositions, such as self-efficacy and self-esteem. Our findings better
   our understanding of formation of the horizontal stratification of

AB Cultural consumption is often viewed as a form of embodied cultural
   capital which can be converted into economic rewards (e.g., earnings)
   because such practices increase the likelihood of moving into more
   advantaged social positions. However, quantitative evidence supporting
   this theory remains uncertain because it is often unable to rule out
   alternative explanations. Cultural consumption appears to influence
   hiring decisions in some elite firms, in both the US and the UK, but it
   is unclear whether these processes are applicable to other professional
   occupations and other labour market processes, such as promotions. We
   examine these processes using data from Understanding Society, an
   individual-level panel survey conducted in the UK, allowing us to
   explore whether cultural consumption predicts future earnings, upward
   social mobility and promotions. People who consume a larger number of
   cultural activities are more likely to earn higher wages in the future,
   to be upwardly socially mobile, and to be promoted. Cultural
   consumption, then, can function as cultural capital in some labour
   market settings, potentially contributing to the reproduction of income
   inequality between generations.

   of two identical randomized field experiments on ethnic discrimination
   in hiring that we conducted in Oslo. The first experiment was conducted
   before the 2011 terrorist attacks in Norway; the second experiment was
   conducted after the attacks. In both experiments, applicants with a
   typical Pakistani name were significantly less likely to get a job
   interview compared to those with a typical Norwegian name. But the
   ethnic gap in call-back rates were very similar in the two experiments.
   Thus, Pakistanis in Norway still experienced the same level of
   discrimination, despite claims that Norwegians have become more positive

   2011.

   interviews with British Muslims living in Leeds or Bradford, I address
   this gap by explicating how co-option of Muslim community members to
   counter extremism fractures relations within Muslim communities. I
   reveal how community members internalize fears of state targeting which
   precipitates internal disciplinary measures. I contribute the category
   of 'internal suspect body' which is materialized through two
   intersecting conditions within preventative counter-terrorism: the
   suspected extremist for Muslims to look out for and suspected informer
   who might report fellow Muslims. I argue that the suspect community
   operates through a network of relations by which terrors of

   changes in its unique trajectory of political, social and economic
   reform. Using China as an example of a region which has been largely
   ignored in contemporary social theory, this article enters the debate to
   contest the extent to which conjugal relationships are democratized in
   line with modernity. We further test the assertion that modern marriages
   are characterized by increased self-disclosure and communication between
   partners. Data from a national survey on Chinese families is analysed in
   relation to the level of self-disclosure between husbands and wives;
   gender division of housework; household decision-making; and home
   ownership. We highlight the impact of gender, cohort and location
   (urban, rural or migrant) on experiences of modernity and draw attention
   to the material, social and cultural factors which continue to shape
   conjugal relations in contemporary Chinese society. Based on our
   findings, we contest the argument that disclosing intimacy between
   intimate partners is a defining characteristic of modern relationships,
   and suggest that other social factors may condition degrees of
   self-disclosure in marriage. Similarly, we question the extent to which
   heterosexual conjugal equality is attained: the cultural practices and
   values of patrilineal family organization, together with material
   circumstances, continue to influence marital relations in China.

AB In this paper, we develop a set-theoretic and possible worlds approach
   to counterfactual analysis in case-study explanation. Using this
   approach, we first consider four kinds of counterfactuals: necessary
   condition counterfactuals, SUIN condition counterfactuals, sufficient
   condition counterfactuals, and INUS condition counterfactuals. We
   explore the distinctive causal claims entailed in each, and conclude
   that necessary condition and SUIN condition counterfactuals are the most
   useful types for hypothesis assessment in case-study research. We then
   turn attention to the development of a rigorous understanding of the
   'minimal-rewrite' rule, linking this rule to insights from set theory
   about the relative importance of necessary conditions. We show why,
   logically speaking, a comparative analysis of two necessary condition
   counterfactuals will tend to favour small events and contingent
   happenings. A third section then presents new tools for specifying the
   level of generality of the events in a counterfactual. We show why and
   how the goals of formulating empirically important versus empirically
   plausible counterfactuals stand in tension with one another. Finally, we
   use our framework to link counterfactual analysis to causal sequences,
   which in turn provides advantages for conducting counterfactual
   projections.

   the investigation of insurance claims fraud in Sweden. It shows how
   power within private insurance companies and the police authority is
   organized around the public-private divide, which is in turn mobilized
   to justify repression and to give investigations legitimacy. The article
   indicates that the formal public-private distinction is far more
   thoroughly maintained than is suggested by the existing literature.
   Rather than challenging the centrality of state power, private insurers
   and the police construct, maintain and have a stake in the reproduction
   of a state-centric monopoly of crime control.

AB This paper aims to understand how people who are homeless respond to
   advanced liberal social services that endeavour to promote their
   autonomy and responsible actions. We prioritize the experiences and
   positions of people who are homeless, and what agentic action means to
   them. Sociological literature is selective about what accounts are
   deemed agentic. Agency is associated with accounts that resist or
   subvert dominant neoliberal framings of homelessness as failure of
   individuals. When people experiencing homelessness or poverty themselves
   foreground autonomy or responsibility, sociologists treat them as
   cultural dopes who have internalized neoliberal discourse. Our analysis
   is driven by an ethnographic study in an Australian homelessness
   shelter. We demonstrate how people who are homeless neither outright
   reject nor completely embrace advanced liberal practices to influence
   their actions and promote autonomy. People engaged in relational
   reasoning. Paternalist and advanced liberal social services were both
   lauded and rejected for their capacities and limitations to realize a
   good life. We contribute to the discussion for sociology to value
   people's accounts and experiences, rather than broader social process
   explaining their accounts. From the perspectives of people who are
   homeless, we show that just because something appears neoliberal does
   not mean it should be automatically rejected.

AB This paper is based on ethnographic research conducted with migrant and
   Italian street vendors in Naples, southern Italy, in 2012. It tells the
   story of Via Bologna market which was nearly closed down by the City
   Hall at the time. Naples is a city where issues of poverty and
   unemployment pre-date and have been exacerbated by manifold narratives
   of crisis now unfolding across Europe regarding the economy, political
   legitimacy, security and migration. Street markets have always been an
   important and visible economic survival strategy for both Neapolitans
   and migrants there. This article shows how the Via Bologna street
   vendors appropriated and adapted discourses about crisis to form their
   own cosmopolitan social movement that halted the closure of the market.
   It argues that, in the age of globalized migration, the multilingual
   nature of such collective action is central to understanding social
   struggles that must be organized between marginalized groups of people
   divided by race, religion, politics and legal status. This, frequently
   ambiguous, transcultural solidarity speaks back against a mainstream
   post-racial discourse - often articulated by the Neapolitan street
   vendors at the market - that would reduce the complexity of such
   collective action to questions of poverty and class struggle.

AB Studying the varieties of welfare can offer surprising insights in the
   workings and tensions of Islamist social movements in such major
   countries as Iran, Egypt, and Turkey. Based on extensive fieldwork and
   (for Iran) the batteries of socio-economic data, the recent monographs
   of sociologists Kevan Harris and Cihan Tugal offer a high-resolution yet
   panoramic overview. Harris re-positions the Iranian historical
   'improvisation called Islamic Republic' as the 'warfare/welfare state'
   forged in the sacrificial defense against Saddam Hussein's onslaught in
   the 1980s. The Iranian 'welfare for martyrs' model itself built on the
   institutional remnants inherited from the earlier developmentalism of
   the shahs. The surprising resilience of ayatollahs' regime is then
   better explained by its accidental affinity to the communist guerrilla
   states in the world-system's semiperiphery like Cuba and Vietnam. By
   contrast, Tugal sees the power of Islamist mobilizing in Egypt and
   Turkey in the historical failure of secular state modernizers,
   respectively Nasser and Ataturk, to meet the social and spiritual
   expectations of rural masses moving into the sprawling cities like Cairo
   and Istanbul. Following Gramsci and Bourdieu, Tugal identifies a
   pregnant tension between the two Islamist models of welfare: neoliberal
   and religious egalitarian. This tension, not unlike the Christian social
   movements of interwar Europe, now amidst the post-2008 economic
   dislocations tends to strengthen the non-capitalist and egalitarian
   vector in the current global transformation.

AB With the growth of Latino and Asian American populations, candidates
   frequently must appeal to diverse electorates. Strategies for doing so
   include emphasizing candidates' racial/ethnic identity and securing
   endorsements from racial/ethnic groups. While many scholars focus on
   candidates' racial/ethnic attributes, ethnic group endorsements are
   understudied. Whether such endorsements induce voters to choose
   ideologically similar candidates (spatial voting), or choose based on
   race/ethnicity (racial voting) is unclear. We address this question by
   examining elections in multiethnic local settings. Using original
   surveys and exit polls, we create comparable measures of candidate and
   voter ideology, and examine how race/ethnicity and ideology affect
   voters' choices. We also embed experiments that manipulate ethnic group
   endorsements. We find that ideology influences voters' choices, but that
   ethnic group endorsements weaken spatial voting. The latter effect among
   whites is driven by racial/ethnic stereotypes. These reactions explain
   why some candidates seek such endorsements and why others might prefer
   to avoid them.

AB Public-sector unions are generally thought to increase the size of
   government through collective bargaining. This article challenges this
   idea for the case of teacher unions in the United States and argues that
   while collective bargaining institutions sometimes lead to increased
   education spending, this is not the norm. Using a new longitudinal data
   set spanning all states before and after they granted collective
   bargaining rights to teachers, the article shows that although states
   that mandate districts to bargain with teachers have higher education
   expenditures than states that do not, the differences precede collective
   bargaining. Difference-in-differences analyses find no evidence that
   introducing collective bargaining rights led to average increases in the
   level of resources devoted to education. Although existing theories
   cannot explain these null findings, the article shows one reason behind
   them is that most laws granting collective bargaining rights to teachers
   were not unambiguously prolabor, but included both pro- and anti-union
   provisions.

AB I advance a theory about how compulsory voting affects the behavior of
   political parties. The theory suggests that parties will pivot toward
   programmatic vote-seeking strategies and away from clientelistic
   tactics, such as vote buying, where voting is compulsory. I test my
   expectations in three separate studies, using several data sources and
   empirical approaches. In Study 1, cross-national analyses show that
   parties behave more programmatically under compulsory voting and that
   vote buying is less common where voting is mandatory. In Study 2,
   synthetic control and difference-in-differences analyses show that a
   switch to compulsory voting in Thailand produced an increase in
   programmatic vote seeking. In Study 3, a list experiment conducted in
   tandem with a natural experiment shows that compulsory voting leads
   parties to rely less on vote-buying tactics in Argentina. I conclude by
   discussing the implications of these findings, which together are
   broadly supportive of my theoretical expectations.

AB An old adage holds that "only Nixon could go to China"; that is, hawkish
   leaders face fewer domestic barriers than doves when it comes to
   pursuing reconciliation with foreign enemies. However, empirical
   evidence for this proposition is mixed. In this article, we clarify
   competing theories, elucidate their implications for public opinion, and
   describe the results of a series of survey experiments designed to
   evaluate whether and why there is a hawk's advantage. We find that hawks
   are indeed better positioned domestically to initiate rapprochement than
   doves. We also find support for two key causal mechanisms: Voters are
   more confident in rapprochement when it is pursued by a hawk and are
   more likely to view hawks who initiate conciliation as moderates.
   Further, the hawk's advantage persists whether conciliatory efforts end
   in success or failure. Our microfoundational evidence thus suggests a
   pronounced domestic advantage for hawks who deliver the olive branch.

AB Attending high school can alter students' life trajectories by affecting
   labor market prospects and through exposure to ideas and networks.
   However, schooling's influence competes with early socialization forces
   and may be confounded by selection biases. Consequently, little is known
   about whether or how high school education shapes downstream political
   preferences and voting behavior. Using a generalized
   difference-in-differences design leveraging variation in U.S. state
   dropout laws across cohorts, I find that raising the school dropout age
   decreases Democratic partisan identification and voting later in life.
   Instrumental variables estimates suggest that an additional completed
   grade of high school decreases Democratic support by around 15
   percentage points among students induced to remain in school by higher
   dropout ages. High school's effects principally operate by increasing
   income and support for conservative economic policies, especially at an
   individual's midlife earnings peak. In contrast, such schooling does not
   affect conservative attitudes on noneconomic issues or political
   engagement.

AB Grievances that derive from the unequal treatment of ethnic groups are a

   reduce the risk of internal conflict. Yet conflict researchers disagree
   on whether formal power-sharing institutions effectively prevent
   large-scale violence. We can improve our understanding of the effect of
   power-sharing institutions by analyzing the mechanisms under which they
   operate. To this effect, we compare the direct effect of formal
   power-sharing institutions on peace with their indirect effect through
   power-sharing behavior. Combining data on inclusive and territorially
   dispersive institutions with information on power-sharing behavior, we
   empirically assess this relationship on a global scale. Our causal
   mediation analysis reveals that formal power-sharing institutions affect
   the probability of ethnic conflict onset mostly through power-sharing
   behavior that these institutions induce.

AB In this article, I defend compulsory voting on the grounds that it
   reinforces the distinctive and valuable role that elections play in
   contemporary democracy. Some scholars have suggested that mandatory
   voting laws can improve government responsiveness to members of poor and
   marginalized groups who are less likely to vote. Critics of compulsory
   voting object that citizens can participate in a wide variety of ways;
   voting is not important enough to justify forcing people to do it. These
   critics neglect the importance of voting's particular role in
   contemporary democratic practice, though. The case for compulsory voting
   rests on an implicit, but widely shared, understanding of elections as
   special moments of mass participation that manifest the equal political
   authority of all citizens. The most prominent objections to mandatory
   voting fail to appreciate this distinctive role for voting and the way
   it is embedded within a broader democratic framework.

AB What does women's presence in political decision-making bodies signal to

   And do women and men respond to women's presence similarly? Though
   scholars have demonstrated the substantive and symbolic benefits of
   women's representation, little work has examined how women's presence
   affects citizens' perceptions of democratic legitimacy. We test the
   relationship between representation and legitimacy beliefs through
   survey experiments on a nationally representative sample of U.S.
   citizens. First, we find that women's equal presence legitimizes
   decisions that go against women's interests. We show suggestive evidence
   that this effect is particularly pronounced among men, who tend to hold
   less certain views on women's rights. Second, across decision outcomes
   and issue areas, women's equal presence legitimizes decision-making
   processes and confers institutional trust and acquiescence. These
   findings add new theoretical insights into how, when, and for whom
   inclusive representation increases perceptions of democratic legitimacy.

AB Both advocates and opponents of retrenchment have treated it as an
   undesirable, last-ditch strategy for states that have already

   identifies an unrecognized benefit of retrenchment: It can provide
   declining states with valuable information about rising states' future
   intentions. By removing constraints over the behavior of rising states
   in a particular region, a declining state can induce hostile risers to
   attempt revision of the regional order. This, in turn, makes a riser's
   cooperative behavior more credible as a signal of benign intentions,
   allowing the decliner to oppose hostile types while accommodating benign
   ones. In contrast to the existing focus on retrenchment as a desperate
   strategy taken from a position of weakness, this article suggests that
   the informational benefits of retrenchment are greatest when it is
   undertaken early, from a position of strength.

   cooperation: cross-group expert appeal and participation in a
   cross-group discussion. The laboratory-in-the-field experiment is set in
   Lebanon's capital, Beirut, and involves interactions between 180 Shia
   and 180 Sunni Muslim participants. We find that the expert appeal
   increases intersectarian cooperation in settings that do not entail
   reciprocal exchange. On average, cross-sectarian discussions do not
   improve cooperation, but those discussions in which participants delve
   deeply into the conflict's causes and possible remedies are associated
   with greater cooperation. Neither intervention diminishes the
   effectiveness of sectarian clientelistic appeals. The policy implication
   of our study is that intergroup cooperation can be strengthened even in
   regions as bitterly divided as the Middle East.

AB Why do some pieces of legislation move forward while others languish? We
   address this fundamental question by examining the role of interest
   groups in Congress, specifically the effect of their legislative
   endorsements in Dear Colleague letters. These letters provide insights
   into the information that members use to both influence and make policy
   decisions. We demonstrate that endorsements from particularly
   well-connected interest groups are a strong cue for members with limited
   information early in the legislative process and help grow the list of
   bill cosponsors. As bills progress, such groups have less direct weight,
   while legislation supported by a larger number of organizations and a
   larger number of cosponsors is more likely to pass. Thus, we illuminate
   the usage of Dear Colleague letters in Congress, demonstrate how members
   use interest groups in the legislative process, and shed new light on
   the varying impact of groups on public policy.

AB Why do Americans' priorities for combating risks like terrorism, climate
   change, and violent crime often seem so uncorrelated with the dangers
   that those risks objectively present? Many scholars believe the answer
   to this question is that heuristics, biases, and ignorance cause voters
   to misperceive risk magnitudes. By contrast, this article argues that
   Americans' risk priorities primarily reflect judgments about the extent
   to which some victims deserve more protection than others and the degree
   to which it is appropriate for government to intervene in different
   areas of social life. The article supports this argument with evidence
   drawn from a survey with 3,000 respondents, using pairwise comparisons
   to elicit novel measures of how respondents perceive nine dimensions of
   100 life-threatening risks. Respondents were well informed about these
   risks' relative magnitudes-the correlation between perceived and actual
   mortality was .82-but those perceptions explained relatively little
   variation in policy preferences relative to judgments about the status
   of victims and the appropriate role of government. These findings hold
   regardless of political party, education, and other demographics. The
   article thus argues that the key to understanding Americans' divergent
   reactions to risk lies more with their values than with their grasp of
   factual information.

AB A key feature of federal systems is the representation of subnational
   units by "territorial representatives" in policymaking at the federal
   level. How do such arrangements influence the linkage between public
   opinion and policy outputs? I argue that policymaking under territorial
   representation should be systematically skewed toward opinion in those
   states where citizens care about a policy issue and have a uniform view
   on it. This claim is tested using a novel data set of policy change in
   the European Union (EU), covering 211 policy issues and 6,506
   observations of opinion-policy dyads. Results show that measures
   weighting opinion across member states by how much national citizens
   care about an issue are better predictors of policy change than EU-wide
   mean opinion. Moreover, congruence between state-level opinion and
   EU-level policy becomes more likely, the more salient and clear-cut
   opinion in a member state is. These findings refine our understanding of
   the opinion-policy linkage under territorial representation.

AB Economic elites regularly seek to exert political influence. But what
   policies do they support? Many accounts implicitly assume economic
   elites are homogeneous and that increases in their political power will
   increase inequality. We shed new light on heterogeneity in economic
   elites' political preferences, arguing that economic elites from an
   industry can share distinctive preferences due in part to sharing
   distinctive predispositions. Consequently, how increases in economic
   elites' influence affect inequality depends on which industry's elites
   are gaining influence and which policy issues are at stake. We
   demonstrate our argument with four original surveys, including the two
   largest political surveys of American economic elites to date: one of
   technology entrepreneurs-whose influence is burgeoning-and another of
   campaign donors. We show that technology entrepreneurs support liberal
   redistributive, social, and globalistic policies but conservative
   regulatory policies-a bundle of preferences rare among other economic
   elites. These differences appear to arise partly from their distinctive
   predispositions.

AB Manipulation checks are often advisable in experimental studies, yet
   they rarely appear in practice. This lack of usage may stem from fears
   of distorting treatment effects and uncertainty regarding which type to
   use (e.g., instructional manipulation checks [IMCs] or assessments of
   whether stimuli alter a latent independent variable of interest). Here,
   we first categorize the main variants and argue that factual
   manipulation checks (FMCs)-that is, objective questions about key
   elements of the experiment-can identify individual-level attentiveness
   to experimental information and, as a consequence, better enable
   researchers to diagnose experimental findings. We then find, through
   four replication studies, little evidence that FMC placement affects
   treatment effects, and that placing FMCs immediately post-outcome does
   not attenuate FMC passage rates. Additionally, FMC and IMC passage rates
   are only weakly related, suggesting that each technique identifies
   different sets of attentive subjects. Thus, unlike other methods, FMCs
   can confirm attentiveness to experimental protocols.

AB Most measures of social conflict processes are derived from primary and
   secondary source reports. In many cases, reports are used to create
   event-level data sets by aggregating information from multiple, and
   often conflicting, reports to single event observations. We argue that
   this pre-aggregation is less innocuous than it seems, costing applied
   researchers opportunities for improved inference. First, researchers
   cannot evaluate the consequences of different methods of report
   aggregation. Second, aggregation discards report-level information
   (i.e., variation across reports) that is useful in addressing
   measurement error inherent in event data. Therefore, we advocate that
   data should be supplied and analyzed at the report level. We demonstrate
   the consequences of using aggregated event data as a predictor or
   outcome variable, and how analysis can be improved using report-level
   information directly. These gains are demonstrated with simulated-data
   experiments and in the analysis of real-world data, using the newly

AB At the microlevel, comparative public opinion data are abundant. But at

   behavior are believed to operate-data are scarce. In response, this
   paper develops a Bayesian dynamic latent trait modeling framework for
   measuring smooth country-year panels of public opinion even when data
   are fragmented across time, space, and survey item. Six models are
   derived from this framework, applied to opinion data on support for
   democracy, and validated using tests of internal, external, construct,
   and convergent validity. The best model is reasonably accurate, with
   predicted responses that deviate from the true response proportions in a
   held-out test dataset by 6 percentage points. In addition, the smoothed
   country-year estimates of support for democracy have both construct and
   convergent validity, with spatiotemporal patterns and associations with
   other covariates that are consistent with previous research.

AB The fixed-effects estimator is biased in the presence of dynamic

   regressors. We argue and demonstrate that fixed-effects estimates can
   amplify the bias from dynamic misspecification and that with omitted
   time-invariant variables and dynamic misspecifications, the
   fixed-effects estimator can be more biased than the 'naive' OLS model.
   We also demonstrate that the Hausman test does not reliably identify the
   least biased estimator when time-invariant and time-varying omitted
   variables or dynamic misspecifications exist. Accordingly, empirical
   researchers are ill-advised to rely on the Hausman test for model
   selection or use the fixed-effects model as default unless they can
   convincingly justify the assumption of correctly specified dynamics. Our
   findings caution applied researchers to not overlook the potential
   drawbacks of relying on the fixed-effects estimator as a default. The
   results presented here also call upon methodologists to study the
   properties of estimators in the presence of multiple model
   misspecifications. Our results suggest that scholars ought to devote
   much more attention to modeling dynamics appropriately instead of
   relying on a default solution before they control for potentially
   omitted variables with constant effects using a fixed-effects
   specification.

AB Researchers who generate data often optimize efficiency and robustness
   by choosing stratified over simple random sampling designs. Yet, all
   theories of inference proposed to justify matching methods are based on
   simple random sampling. This is all the more troubling because, although
   these theories require exact matching, most matching applications resort
   to some form of ex post stratification (on a propensity score, distance
   metric, or the covariates) to find approximate matches, thus nullifying
   the statistical properties these theories are designed to ensure.
   Fortunately, the type of sampling used in a theory of inference is an
   axiom, rather than an assumption vulnerable to being proven wrong, and
   so we can replace simple with stratified sampling, so long as we can
   show, as we do here, that the implications of the theory are coherent
   and remain true. Properties of estimators based on this theory are much
   easier to understand and can be satisfied without the unattractive
   properties of existing theories, such as assumptions hidden in data
   analyses rather than stated up front, asymptotics, unfamiliar
   estimators, and complex variance calculations. Our theory of inference
   makes it possible for researchers to treat matching as a simple form of
   preprocessing to reduce model dependence, after which all the familiar
   inferential techniques and uncertainty calculations can be applied. This
   theory also allows binary, multicategory, and continuous treatment
   variables from the outset and straightforward extensions for imperfect
   treatment assignment and different versions of treatments.

AB This paper creates a multinomial framework for ideal point estimation
   (mIRT) using recent developments in Bayesian statistics. The core model
   relies on a flexible multinomial specification that includes most common
   models in political science as "special cases." I show that popular
   extensions (e.g., dynamic smoothing, inclusion of covariates, and
   network models) can be easily incorporated whilst maintaining the
   ability to estimate a model using a Gibbs Sampler or exact EM algorithm.
   By showing that these models can be written and estimated using a shared
   framework, the paper aims to reduce the proliferation of bespoke ideal
   point models as well as extend the ability of applied researchers to
   estimate models quickly using the EM algorithm. I apply this framework
   to a thorny question in scaling survey responses-the treatment of
   nonresponse. Focusing on the American National Election Study (ANES), I
   suggest that a simple but principled solution is to treat questions as
   multinomial where nonresponse is a distinct (modeled) category. The
   exploratory results suggest that certain questions tend to attract many
   more invalid answers and that many of these questions (particularly when
   signaling out particular social groups for evaluation) are masking
   noncentrist (typically conservative) beliefs.

AB Are student subject experiment pools comparable across institutions?
   Despite repeated concerns over the "college sophomore problem," many
   experiment-based studies still rely on student subject pools due to
   their convenience and accessibility. In this paper, I investigate
   whether student subject pools are comparable across universities by
   examining how respondents across three student subject pools at distinct
   educational institutions perform on the same survey experiment about
   crisis bargaining between states. I argue that, due to selection biases
   inherent in university matriculation and the self-selection of students
   into experimental protocols, respondents across these subject pools will
   exhibit key demographic differences. I also examine whether respondents
   across these subject pools think similarly about international politics
   and respond comparably to experimental treatments. I find that, while
   there are significant demographic differences across subject pools,
   subjects across institutions respond similarly to experimental
   treatments-with the key exception of information regarding the regime
   type of a state. Furthermore, there is little evidence that these
   demographic differences impact conditional average treatment effects
   across subgroups. These findings carry critical implications for the use
   of student samples across political science and within international
   relations more specifically, particularly regarding the current
   replication crisis in the discipline.

AB The fact that highly educated individuals are significantly more likely
   to self-identify as Europeans than those with lower levels of
   educational attainment is one of the most robust findings in the
   scholarship on individual Europeanization. Previous work also shows that
   this cleavage in supranational identification varies cross-nationally
   and over time. We contribute to the existing literature by examining the
   country-level, socio-structural conditions that influence the education
   cleavage. Focusing on how the educational environment influences
   identity formation, we test two divergent predictions of how societal
   education-i.e. the average national level of educational
   attainment-shapes the cleavage between individuals of differing
   education levels with respect to their self-identification as European.
   According to Welzel's (2013) 'cross-fertilization approach', societal
   education should widen the education divide. By contrast, our
   alternative 'cross-attenuating approach' posits that societal education
   should instead help to close it. Using a cross-national time-series
   dataset that includes 28 EU member states and 28 Eurobarometers covering
   1992-2015, as well as between-within multilevel models, we find a
   significantly narrower education cleavage in countries where societal
   education increased the most during the period of our study. This result
   provides strong support for the cross-attenuating approach presented
   here. We theorize that societal education helps to narrow the
   individual-level education cleavage through a discursive and a network
   mechanism.

AB Recent studies have indicated that the relationship between education
   and health differs between men and women. In line with the resource
   substitution theory, these studies demonstrate that women receive
   greater health returns to an additional year of schooling than men do.
   In this article, we argue that this female advantage in the effect of
   education can change across different socio-historical contexts. In
   particular, we investigate the impact of the reversal of the gender gap
   in education on gender differences in the relationship between education
   and health. Using data from the European Social Survey (eight waves:
   2002-2016) for individuals of age 25-75 years (N = 265,299) in 31
   European countries, we find evidence for our central hypothesis: it
   appears that the female advantage in the effect of education on health
   decreases as the gender gap reverses. According to our results, however,
   this situation could be seen as a cost that does not outweigh the
   benefits provided by the unprecedented gains that female education has
   brought about in terms of population health.

AB We compare the predictions of contact theory with those of social
   identity theory (SIT), as they pertain to intergroup relations between
   Jews and Arabs in multicultural and assimilationist schools. In
   accordance with contact theory, it can be assumed that multicultural
   schools would promote interethnic friendships as compared to
   assimilationist schools. According to SIT, however, multicultural
   schools, in which ethnic identity is constantly acknowledged and
   therefore salient, would be expected to be a hindrance to interethnic
   friendships. We collected and analysed student networks in 61 integrated
   classrooms and compared the extent to which Arabs and Jews prefer
   same-ethnic over interethnic friendships in multicultural and
   assimilationist schools. We analysed the data using graph-level
   segregation indices, as well as exponential random graph models.
   Contrary to expectations from contact theory, we found a much larger
   degree of ethnic segregation in friendship networks in multicultural
   than in assimilationist schools. Findings are robust to various methods
   of analysis and alternative explanations. Our results challenge the
   assumptions that multicultural education is conducive to intergroup
   contact. The policy implications of these findings are discussed.

AB After union dissolution, the question of who stays in the joint home and
   who moves to a new place is of great importance to the life courses of
   the separating adults as well as any children involved. Drawing on a
   unique Belgian data set linking Census and Register data (N = 56,931),
   this study addresses the role of heterosexual partners' absolute and
   relative educational attainment by means of diagonal reference models.
   Results for absolute education, which are based on the homogamous
   couples, show that the man is more likely to move when the couple has
   many educational resources, while the woman or both partners are more
   likely to move in couples with low levels of education. Results for
   relative education, which are based on the heterogamous couples, show
   that the partner with the highest education level is more likely to
   stay, particularly when the difference is large. In line with
   predictions based on women's greater perceived vulnerability after
   separation, who moves and who stays is more strongly associated with the
   woman's than with the man's education. This indicates that human capital
   may insure women against poverty by reinforcing their position not only
   in the labour market but also in the housing market.

AB The role of trade unions for public policy, public policy outcomes, and
   political behaviour is a well-studied topic. A serious shortcoming in
   this literature is that unions are usually treated as unitary actors.
   This is striking since not least the Scandinavian countries saw the
   membership growth in independent white-collar unions and their
   federations at the expense of the traditional blue-collar (and thus
   textbook-style) union federations. The growth of independent
   white-collar unions implies that the traditional assumptions about
   unions as advocates of redistribution and state intervention do not
   necessarily hold because this type of union represents potential
   'losers' of redistribution and intervention. Moreover, their members do
   support less redistribution and more market-based allocation of incomes
   as well as privatization, since the solidarity effect fostered by
   traditional unionism is weakened if the higher-income strata are
   organized in separate federations. Consequently, this study addresses an
   important gap in the literature on union membership and political
   preferences by analysing the attitudes towards redistribution and
   state-market relations in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden across union
   federation membership in the past three decades. The findings
   demonstrate that members of independent academic/professional unions
   support market allocation of incomes and less state intervention, while
   the opposite is true for members of traditional blue-collar union
   federations. The effect of income on attitudes towards state and market
   is also consistently stronger in the independent white-collar
   federations in the three countries, which supports the muted solidarity
   effect in this type of union.

AB Recent evidence from large-scale field experiments has shown that
   employers use job candidates' unemployment duration as a sorting
   criterion. In the present study, we investigate what underlies this
   pattern. To this end, we conduct a survey experiment in which employers
   make hiring decisions concerning fictitious job candidates who have
   experienced spells of unemployment of different length. In addition,
   candidates are rated on several statements that are central to four
   signals often associated with unemployment: (i) a signal of
   trainability, (ii) a signal of other fixed skills, (iii) a signal of
   skill loss, and (iv) a signal of negative evaluation by other employers.
   We use these ratings to estimate a multiple mediation model, in which
   the effect of the duration of unemployment on hiring intentions is
   mediated by the four signals. Our findings indicate that longer
   unemployment spells are mainly perceived by employers as a signal of
   lower motivation and, as a result, the long-term unemployed (LTU) have
   lower chances to be hired or even be invited to a job interview.
   Understanding the reasons why employers are reluctant to hire the LTU is
   crucial to devise proper activation measures to facilitate their
   re-employment. Our study is a contribution in this direction.

AB Focusing on the dominant group's (Sunni-Turks) attitudes towards the
   largest ethnic and religious minorities (Kurds and Alevis, respectively)
   in the Turkish social landscape, this study investigates the determining
   factors of ethnic and religious prejudices in intergroup relations. The
   study draws several hypotheses about out-group rejection from social
   identity and ethnic competition theories and tests them utilizing new,
   original public opinion survey data. The empirical findings confirm the
   presence of a substantial degree of ethnic and religious prejudices in
   the Turkish social setting. Furthermore, statistical analyses show that
   unlike economic factors, political and cultural variables, such as
   ideological orientations, nationalist tendencies, and religiosity,
   perform much better in terms of predicting Sunni-Turks' exclusionary
   attitudes towards ethnic and religious out-group members. Thus,
   intergroup prejudice or intolerance in the Turkish setting is deeply
   ingrained in cultural and political divisions rather than in economic
   factors. The study also discusses some major theoretical and practical
   implications of the empirical findings.

AB This article probes the role of two potential dynamic influences on the
   occurrence of violence against refugees in Germany throughout the years
   2015 and 2016. First, it tests whether three kinds of threatening events
   spark anti-refugee violence: (i) violence or crime committed by
   refugees, (ii) police raids against Islamic fundamentalists, (iii)
   terrorist attacks and warnings in Germany and terrorist attacks in
   neighbouring countries. Second, it investigates whether such violence is
   mobilized through public statements by politicians of anti-immigration
   parties. Our results suggest that such negative public cueing indeed
   boosts the probability of attacks. Yet, these statements also seem to be
   prompted in part by preceding threatening events. Among these
   threatening events, terrorist attacks in neighbouring countries, which
   included particularly severe and strongly mediatized events, exert a
   robust influence on violence against refugees. Altogether, having
   examined the 2 years with the largest influx of asylum seekers in modern
   German history, the analysis underscores the importance of situational
   influences for explaining the occurrence of attacks against refugees.

AB The decline of labor unions in the United States has been central to the
   rise of wage inequality since the early 1970s. Recently, sociologists
   have noted that unionization influences inequality through both direct
   and indirect pathways, reconciled with the concept of the moral economy,
   broadly shared norms of fairness institutionalized in market rules and
   customs that can reduce inequality in pay. While the theory of the moral
   economy has been resonant in the stratification literature, few have
   held it to empirical scrutiny. The current study assesses how selection
   bias from unobserved worker-level heterogeneity influences the
   associations between unionization and wage attainment and dispersion. To
   do so, I merge data from the Current Population Survey to 33 waves of
   longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Using
   combinations of variance function regression models, fixed-effects
   regression models, and dynamic panel models, I find that the magnitudes
   of associations tend to be reduced by around half after accounting for
   unobserved heterogeneity. Yet, more critically, the pathways linking
   unions and wage inequality via the moral economy prove to be remarkably
   robust to all tests cast upon them. Results highlight the fundamental
   importance of labor power resources for the contemporary rise of
   inequality. They provide a micro-level foundation for theories linking
   unionization and stratification. They identify the importance of union
   decline for rising earnings volatility. And they provide implications
   for the fallout of economic well-being for workers following antiunion
   policy change. Additional theoretical and policy implications are
   discussed.

AB Studies typically find large variation in labor market outcomes not only

   education. However, the importance of different types of horizontal
   divisions in higher education is mostly treated in separate literatures.
   In this paper, we use multilevel models and an outcome-based approach to
   investigate the relative importance of institution (college),
   department, and field of study in the Norwegian labor market. We find
   that the effects of field of study on wages are generally strong. The
   overall effects of institution are also quite large, but they emerge to
   a considerable extent at the level of departments; the effects of
   institution over and above the effects of department are small. We also
   show that the effects of horizontal divisions are greater at the
   graduate than at the undergraduate level, and that the effects of
   horizontal divisions increase over individuals' work careers.

AB In the wake of college-for-all policy, college aspirations among
   working-class and middle-class young adults have converged, yet class
   gaps in enrollment and completion persist. Building on previous
   literature that uncovers the structural barriers that block
   working-class mobility, we examine the specific narrative content that
   working-class and middle-class young adults and their parents attach to
   the broad "college for all" message. We investigate how their narratives
   of imagined futures shape how they perceive the riskiness of college
   decisions. In-depth interviews with 51 young adult-parent dyads suggest
   that working-class young adults envision college as a route to moral
   worth and an escape from their current grim reality-what we term
   "salvation." Their narratives lend self-efficacy and optimism to their
   lives, but are not organized in ways that protect them from the
   increasingly risky college landscape. Middle-class parents assume
   control over the meanings of college and deploy a narrative of
   insecurity about downward mobility in a competitive economy. By
   contesting the meaning of college as a vehicle for self-realization,
   this narrative buffers youth from risk even as it constrains feelings of
   self-determination in the transition to adulthood.

AB Neighborhoods are an important social context for children's
   development; however, a growing body of research illustrates that there
   is often significant heterogeneity in how neighborhoods influence
   children's outcomes. Scholars have therefore focused greater attention
   on understanding neighborhood effect heterogeneity and the social
   processes that underpin this variation. Recent quantitative work has
   pointed to heterogeneity by age in the effects of moving to low-poverty
   neighborhoods, but questions remain about the mechanisms that explain
   why youth of different ages have divergent outcomes after this move.
   This paper examines the social processes that drive differences in
   neighborhood effects by age through analysis of qualitative interviews
   with low-income Black youth who moved to lower-poverty and more racially
   integrated neighborhoods with a housing mobility program. The findings
   show that the process of friendship formation serves as an important
   mechanism for age differences in school engagement after moving to
   non-poor neighborhoods. Adolescents in this sample hesitated to form new
   friendships after moving, choosing a strategically cautious approach to
   engaging with new peers. In contrast, youth who moved during middle
   childhood quickly formed friendships in their new communities. These new
   friends then encouraged children's engagement and motivation in their
   new schools, amplifying the potential for children to experience
   positive educational effects following this move. Younger youth
   experienced the dual advantages of less exposure to high-poverty
   neighborhoods and an easier process of establishing new friendships in
   their suburban communities.

AB We investigate the implications of the persistence of traditional

   property rights and the economy for monarchies and republics. We argue
   that, relative to republics, monarchies protect property rights to a
   greater extent by reducing the negative effects of internal conflict,
   executive tenure, and executive discretion. In turn, a better protection
   of property rights results in greater standards of living. Using panel
   data on 137 countries between 1900 and 2010, we formulate and test a
   model with endogenous variables. We find strong evidence that monarchies
   contribute to a greater protection of property rights and higher
   standards of living through each of the three theoretical mechanisms
   compared to all republics. We also find that democratic-constitutional
   monarchies perform better than non-democratic and absolute monarchies
   when it comes to offsetting the negative effects of the tenure and
   discretion of the executive branch. We discuss the implications of the
   persistence of traditional patterns of political authority and rule for

   paper argues that global institutions legitimize cultural principles
   such as individualism, human rights, and gender equality, which reshape
   "modern" understandings of marriage and family relations. Formal
   international institutions and treaties do not explicitly proclaim or
   codify the right to divorce, but we suggest that new norms regarding
   divorce emerge from the "penumbras" of world culture and diffuse
   globally. Panel regression models covering 84 countries between 1970 and
   2008 find a strong association between global cultural influence and
   divorce rates, controlling for other factors. Results highlight the
   effects of world society on the private lives of individuals, and
   suggest that world society affects a wider set of outcomes than the

AB Whites' wealth advantage compared to blacks and Hispanics is vast and
   increases with age. While prior research on wealth gaps focuses
   primarily on wealth levels, we adopt a life-course perspective that
   treats wealth as a cumulative outcome and examine wealth accumulation
   across individuals' lives. We test to what extent intergenerational
   disadvantage and disparities in achieved characteristics explain
   accumulation disparities. We hypothesize that disparities in wealth
   determinants, like income and education, family and household
   characteristics, and homeownership and local context, increase through
   early and middle adulthood, widening wealth accumulation gaps. Using the
   National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, we show that whites
   accumulate wealth more rapidly than blacks and Hispanics throughout
   early and middle adulthood, with the result that both groups fall
   further behind whites in amassed wealth with each passing year.
   Furthermore, the accumulation gap grows substantially in the 30s, so
   that blacks and Hispanics in this age range lose ground at an increasing
   annual rate. We find that adjusting for intergenerational disadvantage
   reduces the Hispanic-white and black-white gaps in wealth accumulated
   between ages 20 and 50 by over 40 percent and 50 percent, respectively,
   and even more in young adulthood. Yet, disparities in outcomes like
   income, marriage, and homeownership rise with age; together, these
   intragenerational processes explain a greater share of accumulation gaps
   in middle adulthood than at younger ages. These findings highlight that
   wealth gaps in the United States are both shaped by intergenerational
   legacies of disadvantage and created fresh in each generation through
   unequal distribution of achieved wealth-enhancing traits.

AB Sociologists commonly point to jobseekers' racially segregated networks
   and employers' discriminatory behavior to explain racial inequality in
   employment. Network scholars argue that, given segregated networks and
   black and white employees' unequal position in the labor market,
   employers' reliance on employee referrals reproduces black disadvantage.
   Scholars of discrimination focus instead on employers' unequal treatment
   of equally qualified black and white jobseekers. Drawing on an original
   experiment with a sample of white individuals with hiring
   responsibilities, I seek to bridge these literatures by examining
   whether respondents' racial prejudice affects how they reward employee
   referrals of black and white applicants from black and white employees.
   I use a measure of implicit prejudice that is resistant to social
   desirability and that can capture biases among people who genuinely
   believe they are unbiased. Whether evaluated by low-prejudiced or
   high-prejudiced respondents, white applicants benefit greatly from
   same-race referrals. In contrast, black applicants do not benefit from
   same-race referrals, even when they are evaluated by low-prejudiced
   respondents. In fact, black applicants only benefit from having a
   referral when two conditions are met: the referring employee is white
   and they are evaluated by a relatively low-prejudiced respondent. These
   findings suggest that in addition to their disadvantage in access to
   employee referrals, black jobseekers suffer from a disadvantage in
   returns to these referrals.

AB Theories of ethnic conflict predict that between-group inequality should
   be associated with a greater likelihood of violent conflict, but
   empirical results have been mixed. One reason might be that different
   types of inequalities have opposing effects on the likelihood of
   conflict. In this article, we posit that educational inequalities are
   likely to incentivize collective action by inducing grievances, while
   economic and demographic inequalities may actually dis-incentivize
   collective action by limiting opportunities for disadvantaged groups to
   engage in rebellion. We test these hypotheses on a new ethnic dyad
   database, incorporating 1,548 dyads formed by 290 ethnic groups living
   in 29 Sub-Saharan African countries. The analysis reveals that
   educational inequalities are indeed positively associated with conflict
   incidence, while this is not the case for economic and demographic
   inequalities. The association between educational inequality and
   conflict is stronger if the groups are wealthier. A higher joint
   educational level of the groups is associated with less conflict,
   particularly under more autocratic regimes. These findings demonstrate
   that to better understand the relationship between inequality and
   conflict, it is important to disaggregate the effects of inequalities
   according to the underlying mechanisms and the political context with
   which they are associated.

AB Here, we integrate prior work to develop and test a theory of how
   perceived macro-level trends in racial standing shape whites' views of
   welfare policy. We argue that when whites perceive threats to their
   relative advantage in the racial status hierarchy, their resentment of
   minorities increases. This increased resentment in turn leads whites to
   withdraw support for welfare programs when they perceive these programs
   to primarily benefit minorities. Analysis of American National Election
   Studies data and two survey-embedded experiments support this reasoning.
   In Study 1, we find that whites' racial resentment increased beginning
   in 2008, the year of Barack Obama's successful presidential candidacy
   and a major economic downturn, the latter a factor previously shown to
   amplify racial threat effects. At the same time, whites' opposition to
   welfare increased relative to minorities'. In Study 2, we sought to
   better establish the causal effect of racial status threats. We found
   that experimentally presenting information suggesting that the white
   majority is rapidly declining increased whites' opposition to welfare,
   and this effect was mediated by heightened racial resentment. Finally,
   in Study 3 we found that threatening whites' sense of their economic
   advantage over minorities led whites to report greater opposition to
   welfare programs, but only if these programs were portrayed as primarily
   benefiting minorities, not if they were portrayed as benefiting whites.
   These findings suggest that whites' perceptions that minorities'
   standing is rising can produce periods of "welfare backlash" in which
   adoption of policies restricting or curtailing welfare programs is more
   likely.

AB A wide range of sociological work documents higher rates of violence
   within households in neighborhoods where violence related to illicit
   drug markets is prevalent. Existing explanations for this association
   point to cultural scripts, to an absence of community social control, or
   to the effects of individual exposure to violence on the propensity to
   reproduce it. Drawing on in-depth interviews and field observations, we
   argue that much violence within the home may instead be understood as an
   extension of the systemic violence of the drug trade. That violence
   travels into homes by way of three often coexisting sequential pathways:
   1) invasion, in which dealers enter homes in search of other drug market
   participants and families are caught in the middle; 2) protection, in
   which family members seek to protect themselves and each other from
   repeated theft of household items; and 3) preemption, in which parents
   use violence against their children in an effort to prevent more serious
   violence against them by other drug industry participants. This analysis
   sheds new light on the impacts of the current governance of drug markets
   and on the difficult choices faced by families in highly vulnerable
   contexts, contributing to a theorization of violence as situated not in
   individuals or groups but in patterned sequences of events.

AB Prior studies on innovation adoption have underscored that the refusal
   to adopt popular innovations becomes less accepted as such innovations
   spread. In this paper, I re-examine this prevailing account using the
   lens of gender. Focusing on the adoption of bird photography, a
   technologically advanced method to help save wild birds that became
   widespread in early twentieth-century America, I examine how gendered
   expectations in society shaped the adoption of an innovation. Using a
   unique database coded from archival documents of the first American bird
   protection movement, which was prominent between 1899 and 1920, I find
   that the non-adoption of a technological innovation is rather accepted
   when the meaning of the innovation is gendered and its (non) adoption is
   accountably masculine (or feminine). Stemming from that historical case,
   the results of this study have contemporary relevance to understanding
   the role of gendered expectations in shaping innovation adoption,
   particularly in science and technology.

AB Building on the growing literature on new immigrant destinations, this
   paper examines new employment patterns of low-skilled Chinese immigrants
   in the United States. We identify an important channel of employment in
   new destinations for the case of Chinese low-skilled immigrants:
   employment agencies in New York City's Chinatown. We carried out two
   surveys of employment agencies during 2010-2011. Our findings suggest
   that there has been a profound change in settlement patterns of
   low-skilled immigrants: moving away from traditional Chinatowns in major
   American cities toward non-gateway destinations and rural areas. These
   new settlement locations are characterized by a low unemployment rate
   and low crime rate. Contrary to predictions from ethnic economy and
   mainstream economic perspectives, Chinese restaurant jobs tend not to be
   in places with a high concentration of Chinese immigrants, but rather in
   places with a high proportion of non-Hispanic whites. In addition, the
   farther the jobs are from New York City, the higher the salary. We
   discuss the implications of this fundamental change for
   re-conceptualizing the immigrant labor market and immigrant
   socioeconomic mobility in American society.

AB This article conducts a negative reading of Weber's ideal type of

   interactants that are implicated in his descriptions of charismatic
   social processes. In so doing, this article advances the "charismatic
   counter-role" as an umbrella term that captures the performative bearing
   of a variety of actors on processes of charismatic interaction.
   Specifically, in addition to devoted followers (already much discussed
   in the literature), this typology contains unworthy challengers
   (competitors who fall short when judged by the new terms of legitimacy
   that the charismatic leader creatively establishes); and colossal
   players (interlocutors that are appropriately "to scale" for
   highlighting the extraordinary missions to which the charismatic leader
   aspires). Together, these charismatic counter- roles interact in ways
   that comprise a charismatic social system that gives a better account
   than has heretofore been available for the unstoppable momentum of
   charismatic challenges. Using the "Trump phenomenon" of 2015-2016 as its
   empirical source, and employing analytical tools from symbolic
   interactionist and performative approaches to social theory, this
   article has implications for future studies of how charisma destabilizes
   traditional and/or rational-legal social orders.

AB How can we account for the role of ignorance and knowledge in global
   governance? It is a contention of earlier scholarship in international
   relations and political sociology that knowledge production is tightly
   coupled with rational action - regardless of whether knowledge widely
   influences different stakeholders or not. This scholarship equally tends
   to assume an ignorance-knowledge binary relationship that associates
   ignorance with powerlessness and knowledge with power. This is a view we
   dispute. Calling for a new approach to the study of ignorance and
   knowledge in international politics, our article builds on research from
   ignorance studies, science and technology studies and critical race
   theory to derive a novel typology of epistemologies of power in which
   truth and ignorance are defined and combined in a plurality of ways.
   Approaching differing epistemologies of power in the transnational realm
   in a general or 'ecumenical' manner, we identify weaknesses in earlier
   approaches to the study of knowledge production in global affairs, and
   present four new concepts: 'factual determinism', 'cynical realism',
   'unseeing proceduralism' and 'hopeful constructivism'. Through this
   framework, our article calls for greater recognition of the constitutive
   role that ignorance plays in operations of power on a global scale.

   Province highlighted the difficulties of reliance on state-provided
   information when states have incentives to conceal discrediting
   information about public health threats. Using SARS and the
   International Health Regulations (IHR) as a starting point, this article
   examines negotiated information orders in global public health
   governance and the irregularities in the supply of data that underlie
   them. Negotiated information orders within and among the organizations
   in a field (here, e.g., the World Health Organization, member states,
   government agencies, and international non-governmental organizations)
   spell out relationships among different categories of knowledge and
   non-knowledge - what is known, acknowledged to be known, and available
   for use in decision making versus what might be known but cannot be
   acknowledged or officially used. Through information leveraging,
   technically sufficient information then becomes socially sufficient
   information. Thus it is especially information initially categorized as
   non-knowledge - including suppressed data, rumour, unverified evidence,
   and unofficial information - that creates pressure for the renegotiation
   of information orders. The argument and evidence of the article also
   address broader issues about how international law and global norms are
   realigned, how global norms change, and how social groups manage risk.

AB In an age of expertise, where knowledge ostensibly reigns, global
   governance not infrequently settles for ignorance. To understand this
   puzzle, this article draws upon extensive empirical research on two
   sites within the global governance of finance. One is directed to the
   suppression of money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
   by the Financial Action Task Force and International Monetary Fund.
   Another intends to stimulate the supply of otherwise scarce money to
   financial markets through global lawmaking by the UN Commission on
   International Trade Law. In both cases vast enterprises of global
   regulation and lawmaking proceed on weakly founded justificatory
   rhetorics designated here as 'plausible folk theories.' Six properties
   make a folk theory plausible: parsimony, face validity, rhetorical
   compactness, ambiguity, affinity with extant beliefs, and unexamined
   premises and logics. Plausible folk theories offer organizational
   benefits to IOs. They also allow a politics of temporality that may
   shorten temporal horizons, or weaken and eliminate IO accountability.
   Finally, three variants of ignorance contribute to choices by
   international organizations not to get beyond plausible folk theories to
   justify their regulatory and lawmaking initiatives: inadvertent
   ignorance, willful ignorance, and strategic or rational ignorance.

   International lawyers indeed must ground their legal narratives with
   plausible sociological explanations of contextual elements to overcome
   their lack of familiarity with the field and the scarcity of their

   in contrast, I analyse how the pursuit of such knowledge makes the

   know empowers others, ignorance becomes a strategic alternative. This
   mechanism should play out strongly at the intersection of global
   governance and local political crises: here, global governance actors
   lack knowledge, investigations often constitute the first direct
   interaction between actors from both sides, and solidification of power
   (instead of empowering others) should be a central interest of global
   governance actors. I first explore the hypothesized mechanisms
   theoretically and develop a framework to analyse dependencies between
   investigators and their interlocutors. This framework then facilitates a
   within-case comparison of investigative approaches of United Nations
   Panels of Experts. The results support and elucidate the hypothesized
   mechanisms. The study shows how the analysis of social interaction can
   create new views of the much-studied relationship between knowledge and

AB "Legal recursivity" is a concept introduced by socio-legal scholars to
   capture the progressive elaboration of transnational rules through
   policy linkages at the international and domestic levels, and the
   associated jurisdictional expansion of international institutions to new
   policy areas. Recursivity can take many forms, and this article
   introduces the concept of "antagonistic recursivity" to capture a dual
   process of recursive legal innovation and antagonistic obstruction by
   the same policy actors. The article shows how such antagonistic
   recursivity worked in the case of the global fight against private
   nuclear proliferators after the 2003 revelations about the reach of the
   A. Q. Khan network. In the case under study, antagonistic recursivities
   took the form of executive-driven innovation in rule-making and
   simultaneous subversion of the same rules by the executive most
   implicated in the new cycle of policy innovation: the United States
   government. This paradox can be explained in the following manner.
   Antagonistic recursivity, the article demonstrates, is likely to emerge
   when legal rules of global governance have already been previously
   defined in an opaque manner, so as to help hegemons follow multiple
   foreign policy goals: the subversion of the most recent policy
   innovations is then the unfortunate result of attempts to hide prior
   cover-ups rather than a purposeful violation of new rules.

AB This article builds on ignorance studies to revisit how we understand
   the role of expertise in international policymaking. A fundamental
   component of ignorance is concealing what you know. For experts, risk
   ignorance is a strategic resource when the policymaking process becomes
   a contested exchange. This article covers IMF lending programmes in
   Europe in 2008-13 with a special focus on Greece. Empirical data is
   drawn from policy documents. I find that risk ignorance at the IMF
   resulted from a joint process of 'private alteration' and 'public
   obfuscation': the alteration of normal scenarios of debt sustainability
   in private negotiations worked in tandem with the obfuscation of
   programme risks in the public stage. The empirical contribution of this
   article is to show that the 'failure' of the IMF programme for Greece
   can be reconceptualized as 'success'. The immediate goal of the
   programme was to bailout Greece's creditors and avoid the breakup of
   European monetary institutions. In this respect, the programme was
   successful. But success came at a huge cost for Greece. Analytically,
   this article suggests that knowledge procurement based on empirical
   fact-gathering is not always the ultimate goal of international
   organizations and the communities of experts working within them.

AB In this article we carry out the most comprehensive analysis of social
   and spatial mobility in the UK to date and the first to directly link
   different dimensions of mobility to processes of social class formation.
   Using new analytical techniques in this field, we integrate quantitative
   and qualitative data from the 1958 Birth Cohort Study, combining
   text-mining and correspondence analysis in order to examine the
   intersection of geographical and social mobility with class identities.
   This work reflects a revival of interest in the spatialization of class
   inequalities, which is connected to policy concerns about the regional
   dimension of Britain's mobility 'crisis' that have intensified in the
   wake of the 'Brexit' vote. We find that the South's role as an
   'escalator' region for upward mobility has continued and that the
   relationship between social and spatial mobility both confirms and
   qualifies the role of London and the South East in generating
   inequalities. We show that different migration-mobility transitions are
   associated with distinctive and contrasting class identity narratives.
   Those who move from North to South stand out in particular for the way
   their 'class talk' reveals the social disorientation that attends their
   success. The contrasting ways in which other groups express their social
   identities suggests that the interplay of geographical and social
   mobilities performs a significant role in regional cultural divisions.

AB The iconic 'liberal theory' of stratification fails to attend to the
   many types of downward mobility and wage loss generated by
   late-industrial stratification systems. Although the liberal theory and
   its close cousins assume that loss and failure will be interpreted in
   individualistic terms, recent developments suggest instead that they are
   generating solidary groups that are increasingly locked into zero-sum
   contest and successfully mobilized by politicians and other norm
   entrepreneurs. These developments imply a Marxisant future for
   late-industrial inequality that bears scant resemblance to the highly
   individualized, unstructured, and non-conflictual stratification system
   envisaged by the liberal theory. We outline a new post-liberal theory of
   stratification that better captures the forces making for change and
   resistance in late-industrial societies.

AB In British social mobility discourse, the rhetoric of fair access can
   obscure wider issues of social justice. While socio-economic
   inequalities continue to shape young people's lives, sociological work
   on class dis-identification suggests social class is less obviously
   meaningful as a source of individual and collective identity. This paper
   considers subjective understandings of the post-16 education and
   employment landscape in this context, drawing on qualitative research
   exploring the aspirations of young men and women as they completed
   compulsory education in north-west England, and the hopes their parents
   had for their future. It shows how unequal access to resources shaped
   the older generation's expectations for their children, although this
   was rarely articulated using the explicit language of class. Their
   children recognized they faced a difficult job market but embraced the
   idea that success was possible through hard work. Both generations drew
   moral boundaries and made judgments based on implicit classed discourses
   about undeserving others, while at the same time disavowing class
   identities. There was a more explicit recognition of gender inequality
   among the parents framed with reference to hopes for greater freedom for
   their daughters. Opportunities and inequalities were thus understood in
   complex and sometimes contradictory ways.

AB This paper examines the rise of a new elite of 'super-state' schools in
   London, revealing a growing divide within the state sector which
   problematizes claims that the capital is a 'hotspot' for social mobility
   (Social Mobility Commission ). Although recent research has revealed a
   'London effect' in which students in the capital on Free School Meals
   outperform their peers in other regions (Greaves, Macmillan and Sibieta
   ), inequalities between London's schools in access to elite universities
   have been overlooked. Drawing on a case study of a suburban London
   grammar school, 'King Henry's School', I show how ethnic-minority
   suburbanization has combined with an institutional strategy to compete
   with elite private schools. Strategies of selection have been mobilized
   alongside elements of elite 'gentlemanly' educational culture in order
   to reposition the school within the hierarchy of London's schools. The
   result is a hyper-selective school which provides a conduit to elite
   universities for upwardly mobile British-Asian students. I show that
   this strategy has strong parallels with the school's attempts in the
   early twentieth century to compete with London's fee-paying 'public'
   schools. The continuing symbolic value of 'traditional' forms of elite
   educational culture to a school seeking to reposition itself within the
   field reflects deep structural patterns of inequality in English
   education. To understand how apparent improvements in social mobility
   can sit alongside deepening inequalities between state schools, there is
   a need for a historical sociological approach that takes account of
   long-term processes of institutional change (Savage ; Inglis ).

AB Drawing on in-depth interviews with descendants of North African
   working-class immigrants admitted to elite higher institutions in
   France, this paper investigates the under-researched role of family
   dynamics in facilitating upward educational mobility and informing the
   experience of social ascension. It shows that concrete mobility
   strategies, such as authoritative parenting and close mentorship from
   older siblings, have been deployed to enable the respondents'
   educational attainment. Moreover, a set of moral resources transmitted
   through stories about family-rooted aspirations and stories about
   post-migration hardships and sacrifices have contributed to forging
   strong motivational dispositions that have facilitated school success
   among the respondents. These resources have further shaped the symbolic
   significance the interviewees associate with mobility. In contrast with
   the dominant individual-centred narrative of success, for
   second-generation North African immigrants, mobility represents a
   powerful way of 'giving back' to former-generation migrants whose
   mobility dreams often had to be relinquished. The respondents also
   position themselves as role-models for other youths of racially and
   socially disadvantaged backgrounds: their mobility pathways are
   described as vital for collective advancements particularly through the
   sense of minority empowerment these generate.

AB Social class has traditionally played a key role in explaining social
   behaviour and cognition. However, recent analyses have been dominated by
   the view that the relevance of class for behaviour has dwindled in
   advanced industrial societies. We contest this view by focusing on the
   subjective components of class consciousness. Using a national survey of
   Danish citizens, we show that individuals continue to hold meaningful
   conceptions of classes, to identify with them and, moreover, to perceive
   substantial levels of differences between them with these latter beliefs
   being strongly structured by respondent class identification. These
   results are all the more intriguing because they stem from a high
   affluence/low inequality national context that should be a particularly
   good case for failing to find such rich class perceptions.

AB Our contribution assesses the role of information barriers for patterns
   of participation in Higher Education (HE) and the related social
   inequalities. For this purpose, we developed a large-scale clustered
   randomised experiment involving over 9,000 high school seniors from 62
   Italian schools. We designed a counseling intervention to correct
   student misperceptions of the profitability of HE, that is, the costs,
   economic returns and chances of success of investments in different
   tertiary programs. We employed a longitudinal survey to test whether
   treated students' educational trajectories evolved differently relative
   to a control group. We find that, overall, treated students enrolled
   less often in less remunerative fields of study in favour of
   postsecondary vocational programmes. Most importantly, this effect
   varied substantially by parental social class and level of education.
   The shift towards vocational programmes was mainly due to the offspring
   of low-educated parents; in contrast, children of tertiary graduates
   increased their participation in more rewarding university fields.
   Similarly, the redistribution from weak fields to vocational programmes
   mainly involved the children of the petty bourgeoisie and the working
   class, while upper class students invested in more rewarding university
   fields. We argue that the status-maintenance model proposed by Breen and
   Goldthorpe can explain these socially differentiated treatment effects.
   Overall, our results challenge the claim that student misperceptions
   contribute to horizontal inequalities in access to HE.

AB The aim of this paper is to develop and apply a framework to explore how
   moralities of consumption are constituted in and through markets. Using
   the case of ready-made foods, this paper argues moral economies are
   comprised through interactions between micro-, meso- and macro-level
   processes in the form of instituted systems of provision, state
   regulation, collective food customs promoted though media, NGOs and
   lifestyle practitioners, and the everyday reflections of consumers.
   Building on a theoretical framework developed to understand the moral
   economy of work and employment (Bolton and Laaser 2013), this paper
   explores how markets for ready-made food are incessantly negotiated in
   the context of moral ideas about cooking, femininity and individual
   responsibility. It focuses on 'new' market innovations of fresh
   ready-to-cook meal solutions and explores how these products are both a
   response to moralizing discourses about cooking 'properly', as well as
   an intervention into the market that offers opportunities for new moral
   identities to be performed. Using data gathered from interviews with
   food manufacturers and consumers, I advocate for a multi-layered
   perspective that captures the dynamic interplay between consumers,
   markets and moralities of consumption.

AB While a number of investigations have examined how gay Muslim men view
   homosexuality in relation to religious Western homophobia, this research
   constitutes the first account of the experiences of self-identified gay
   men living in an African, Muslim nation, where same-sex sex is both
   illegal and actively persecuted. We interviewed 28 gay men living in
   Tunisia in order to understand how they assimilate their sexual,
   religious and ethnic identities within a highly homophobic culture.
   Utilizing notions of homoerasure and homohysteria (McCormack and Eric
   Anderson ,b), and examining the intersection of identity conflict and
   new social movement theory, we highlight four strategies that
   participants use to negotiate the dissonance of living with conflicting
   identities in a context of religious homophobia: (1) privileging their
   Islamic identities and rejecting homosexuality as a legitimate sexual
   identity; (2) rejecting Islam and accepting homosexuality as a
   legitimate sexual identity; (3) interpreting Islam to be supportive of
   homosexuality; and (4) creating a non-penetrative homosexuality to be
   compatible with literal Qur'anic interpretations. We discuss the
   multiple difficulties these men face in relation to religious
   intolerance and ethnic heteronormativity, and reflect upon the
   possibilities and obstacles of using Western identity politics towards
   the promotion of social justice within a framework of growing
   homohysteria.

AB We investigate ways in which international evangelical Christian
   humanitarians talk about time as they engaged in humanitarian assistance
   and development work in South Sudan. Our focus on Christian development
   work is motivated by a desire to understand how and why people persevere
   in humanitarian work and reconcile seemingly impossible circumstances
   and to further elaborate sociological conceptions of time as experienced
   by people in their own lives. We argue that their faith commitments
   produce ways of understanding time and causality which make possible
   their attachment to risky and dangerous work. Our work is based on
   in-depth interviews with people who work or have recently worked for
   Christian faith-based organizations in South Sudan (n = 30). Drawing on
   Tavory and Eliasoph's () concepts of life narratives and life projects,
   we treat our participants as culturally competent actors who skilfully
   construct their stories through drawing on collectively shared
   faith-inflected ideas about temporality and causation. We argue that
   these ideas represent an important resource for getting through the
   risks, challenges and uncertainties of doing humanitarian work in
   complex crises.

   success. We analyze IVF's rich choice structure by estimating a dynamic

   simulations show that insurance mandates for treatment or hard limits on

   Insurance plus price-based incentives against risky treatment, however,

AB This article develops a theory of "societalization," demonstrating its
   plausibility through empirical analyses of church pedophilia, media
   phone-hacking, and the financial crisis. Although these strains were
   endemic for decades, they had failed to generate broad crises. Reactions
   were confined inside institutional boundaries and handled by
   intra-institutional elites according to the cultural logics of their
   particular spheres. The theory proposes that boundaries between spheres
   can be breached only if there is code switching. When strains become
   subject to the cultural logics of the civil sphere, widespread anguish
   emerges about social justice and concern for the future of democratic
   society. Once admired institutional elites come to be depicted as
   perpetrators, and the civil sphere becomes intrusive legally and
   organizationally, leading to repairs that aim for civil purification.
   Institutional elites soon engage in backlash efforts to resist reform,
   and a war of the spheres ensues. After developing this
   macro-institutional model, I conceptualize civil sphere agents, the
   journalists and legal investigators upon whose successful performances
   the actual unfolding of societalization depends. I also explore "limit
   conditions," the structures that block societalization. I conclude by
   examining societalization, not in society but in social theory,
   contrasting the model with social constructionism, on the one hand, and
   broad traditions of macro-sociological theory, on the other.

AB A wide class of economic exchanges, such as bribery and compensated
   adoption, are considered morally disreputable precisely because they are
   seen as economic exchanges. However, parties to these exchanges can
   structurally obfuscate them by arranging the transfers so as to obscure
   that a disreputable exchange is occurring at all. In this article, we
   propose that four obfuscation structures-bundling, brokerage, gift
   exchange, and pawning-will decrease the moral opprobrium of external
   audiences by (1) masking intentionality, (2) reducing the explicitness
   of the reciprocity, and (3) making the exchange appear to be a type of
   common practice. We report the results from four experiments assessing
   participants' moral reactions to scenarios that describe either an
   appropriate exchange, a quid pro quo disreputable exchange, or various
   forms of obfuscated exchange. In support of our hypotheses, results show
   that structural obfuscation effectively mitigates audiences' moral
   offense at disreputable exchanges and that the effects are substantially
   mediated by perceived attributional opacity, transactionalism, and
   collective validity.

AB The housing boom of the mid-2000s saw the widespread popularization of
   non-occupant housing investment as an entrepreneurial activity within
   U.S. capitalism. In 2005, approximately one sixth of all
   mortgage-financed home purchases in the United States were for
   investment purposes. This article develops a sociological account that
   links the geographic distribution of popular investment to the social
   and institutional organization of communities. Regression analyses of
   1,566 municipalities from 2000 to 2006 indicate that non-occupant
   investment (but not conventional owner-occupant investment) occurred at
   significantly greater rates in places where local development
   institutions were organized in accordance with laissez-faire principles
   to a greater degree, where economic activities in other domains were
   less locally embedded in place, and where greater residential
   instability produced more tenuous connections between residents and
   places. The magnitudes of these associations suggest that social
   organization and cultural-institutional conditions were at least as
   informative as variations in housing price appreciation in shaping the
   incidence of investor activity during the bubble. Social organization
   also moderated the behavioral effects of price appreciation. The article
   advances research on locally-embedded bases of economic action by

AB For more than a century, the American welfare state required working-age
   adults to obtain social welfare benefits through their linkages to
   employers, spouses, or children. Recent changes to U.S. healthcare
   policy prompted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA),
   however, provide adults with new pathways for accessing a key form of
   social welfare-health insurance-decoupled from employers, spouses, and
   children. Taking advantage of this fundamental shift in the country's
   system of social welfare provision, I use data from the National Survey
   on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to explore patterns of health insurance
   coverage from before and after the ACA became active in 2014. The
   results show that the salience of labor market, marriage, and family
   attachments as pathways to coverage significantly declined in the first
   three years following passage of the ACA. By providing adults with a new
   route to coverage decoupled from their institutional attachments, the
   ACA helped narrow health insurance inequalities across gender, race and
   ethnicity, and education. Given the strong association between health
   insurance and health outcomes, the results from this study raise
   important questions about the centrality of institutional attachments
   for our knowledge of health inequalities.

AB Bachelor's degree (BA) completion is lower among black students than
   among white students. In this study, we use data from the Education
   Longitudinal Study of 2002 and the Integrated Postsecondary Education
   Data System, together with regression-based analytical techniques, to
   identify the primary sources of the BA completion gap. We find that
   black students' lower academic and socioeconomic resources are the
   biggest drivers of the gap. However, we also find that black students
   are more likely to enroll in four-year colleges than are white students,
   given pre-college resources. We describe this dynamic as "paradoxical
   persistence" because it challenges Boudon's well-known assertion that
   the secondary effect of educational decision-making should reinforce the
   primary effect of resource discrepancies. Instead, our results indicate
   that black students' paradoxical persistence widens the race gap in BA
   completion while also narrowing the race gap in BA attainment, or the
   proportion of high school graduates to receive a BA. This narrowing
   effect on the BA attainment gap is as large or larger than the narrowing
   effect of black students' "overmatch" to high-quality colleges,
   facilitated in part by affirmative action. Paradoxical persistence
   refocuses attention on black students' individual agency as an important
   source of existing educational gains.

AB The children of high-income parents often become high-income adults,
   while their low-income peers often become low-income adults. Education
   plays a central role in this intergenerational income persistence.
   Because education-based inequalities grew in recent decades, many
   scholars predicted that intergenerational income persistence would
   increase. However, previous research suggests that it remained stable
   across recent cohorts. We address this puzzle. Analyzing National
   Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data, we find that growing educational
   inequality by parental income, along with rising economic returns to
   education, increased intergenerational persistence, as scholars
   expected. However, two countervailing trends offset this increase. The
   expansion of higher education reduced persistence, because completing
   college helps low-income children become high-income adults. Yet, this
   reduction in persistence was far from enough to offset the increase in
   persistence associated with growing educational inequality and rising
   educational returns. Intergenerational persistence would have increased
   if not for another change: within educational groups, parental income
   became less predictive of adult income. New methodological tools
   underlie these findings, tools that quantify, for the first time,
   education's full force in intergenerational income persistence. These
   findings suggest that to reduce intergenerational persistence,
   educational policies should focus less on how many people complete
   college and more on who completes college.

AB Why did France influence the geopolitical system of eighteenth-century
   Europe more effectively than did Britain? Explanations pointing to
   states' military and economic power are unable to explain this outcome.
   I argue that durable geopolitical influence depends on states' symbolic
   capacities to secure recognition from competitor states, in addition to
   their coercive and economic capacities. And I show that states are
   liable to secure recognition to the extent that their agents embody
   social dispositions congruent with those of competitor agents. France
   converted military and economic power into durable influence in
   eighteenth-century Europe because French agents and most of their
   European counterparts shared courtly standards of competence, and they
   were invested in the common stakes of patrimonial sovereignty. By
   contrast, Britain failed to convert its greater material power into
   similar influence because British agents tended to lack courtly manners
   and they were uninterested in patrimonial stakes.

AB Why are ethnic movements more likely to turn violent in some multiethnic
   countries than in others? Focusing on the long-term legacies of European
   overseas colonialism, I investigate the effect of distinct ethnic
   cleavage types on the consequences of ethnic group mobilization. The
   colonial settler states and other stratified multiethnic states are
   characterized by an equilibrium of inequality in which historically
   marginalized groups lack both the organizational strength and the
   opportunities for armed rebellion. In contrast, ethnic mobilization in
   the decolonized states and other segmented multiethnic societies is more
   likely to trigger violent conflict. I test these arguments in a global
   quantitative study from 1946 to 2009, using new data on the linguistic
   and religious segmentation of ethnic groups. The results confirm that
   the extremely unequal colonial settler states experience less violence
   than the decolonized states and other multiethnic countries. Ethnic
   conflict is generally more likely the more segmented and less
   hierarchically structured multiethnic states are. Specifically, stable
   between-group hierarchies reduce the risk of governmental conflict,
   whereas segmentation affects secessionist violence.

AB International cooperation can fail even though governments have no
   distributional conflicts or incentives to free-ride, face no
   informational or credibility problems, and even agree on the policies
   that need to be implemented. Germany's refusal to cooperate with the
   Eurogroup members on the Greek bailout in 2010 until the crisis
   threatened to derail the entire Eurozone is puzzling in that regard
   especially because Germany is the main beneficiary of the euro. It was
   alleged at the time that this was a dilatory tactic designed to postpone
   a domestically unpopular decision until after crucial regional
   elections. But why would voters allow themselves to be misled like that?
   And why did Merkel agree to the bailout before the elections took place?
   To analyze how citizen preferences affect international cooperation, we
   develop a gametheoretic model of the four-way interaction between two
   governments that must coordinate a response to a crisis affecting both
   countries but who also must face the polls domestically with an
   electorate that might be uncertain whether a response is necessary. We
   find that, paradoxically, governments that stand to receive the greatest
   benefits from international cooperation face the greatest obstacles to
   implementing the required policies even when voters would want them to.
   We show how the model can rationalize Merkel's electoral strategy and
   why her party suffered at the polls when the strategy went off the
   rails.

AB International relations scholarship has made great progress on the study
   of compliance with international agreements. While persuasive, most of
   this work has focused on states' de jure compliance decisions, largely
   excluding the de facto behavior of nonstate actors whose actions the
   agreement hopes to constrain. Of particular interest has been whether
   the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention (ABC) might reduce the propensity of
   multinational corporations (MNCs) to bribe officials in host countries
   through its mechanisms of extraterritoriality and extensive peer review.
   Unfortunately, research is hampered by reporting bias. Since the
   convention raises the probability of investors' punishment for bribery
   in their home countries, it reduces both the incentives for bribery and
   willingness to admit to the activity. This generates uncertainty over
   which of these incentives drives any correlation between signing the
   convention and reductions in reported bribery. We address this problem
   by employing a specialized survey experiment that shields respondents
   and reduces reporting bias. We find that after the onset of Phase 3 in
   2010, when the risk of noncompliance increased for firms subject to the
   OECD-ABC, those MNCs reduced their actual bribery relative to their
   nonsignatory competitors.

   develop a military capacity. However, since 1999, the UN Security
   Council has authorized all UN multidimensional peacekeeping operations
   under Chapter VII of the UN Charter to use force. The mandates do not
   serve to achieve the council's stated goal of maintaining international
   peace, nevertheless, the council repeats these mandates in every
   multidimensional peacekeeping resolution. Neither constructivist
   accounts of normative change, nor the rational pursuit of stated goals,
   nor organizational processes can explain the repetition of force
   mandates. Instead, we draw on insights from small-group psychology to
   advance a novel theoretical proposition: the repetition of force
   mandates is the result of "group-preserving" dynamics. The P-5 members
   strive to maintain their individual and collective status and legitimacy
   by issuing decisions on the use of force. Once members achieve a
   decision, the agreement is applied in future rounds of negotiations,
   even when the solution does not fit the new context and may appear
   sub-optimal, illogical, or even pathological. Privileging the
   achievement and reproduction of agreement over its content is the
   essence of group preserving. We present an original data set of all
   peacekeeping mandates, alongside evidence from dozens of interviews with
   peacekeeping officials, including representatives of all of the Security
   Council's permanent members. We assess this original data using expected
   causal process observations derived from rationalist, constructivist,
   organizational, and psychological logics.

AB Militant groups, like all organizations, carefully consider the tactics
   and strategies that they employ. We assess why some militant
   organizations diversify into multiple tactics while others limit
   themselves to just one or a few. This is an important puzzle because
   militant organizations that employ multiple approaches to violence are
   more likely to stretch state defenses, achieve tactical success, and
   threaten state security. We theorize that militant organizations respond
   to external pressure by diversifying their tactics to ensure their
   survival and continued relevance, and that the primary sources of such
   pressure are government repression and interorganizational competition.
   We find consistent support for these propositions in tests of both the
   Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and Minorities at Risk Organizational
   Behavior (MAROB) data sets. We bolster these findings with an additional
   specification that employs ethnic fractionalization in the first stage
   of a multi-process recursive model. These findings are relevant not only
   for academic research but for policy as well. While it is difficult for
   countries to anticipate the character of future tactical choices, they
   may be able to anticipate which groups will most readily diversify and
   thereby complicate counterterrorism efforts.

AB In this paper I examine what constructivist approaches to IR tell us
   about how states should act when confronted by atrocity crimes in the
   context of a politically pluralist international society. Building on
   the work of theorists who responded to Richard Price and Christian
   Reus-Smit's call to substantiate the constructivist's claim to explain
   "moral progress," and to better inform normative assessments, I claim
   that the constructivist emphasis on historical and social contingency
   does not rule out ethical standpoints, suggesting instead a "pragmatic"
   ethic. Norms are hypotheses rather than absolute values. The task of the
   pragmatic constructivist is not to establish beyond doubt the
   normativity of a norm-the task is to test the norm for how well its
   "meaning-in-use" supports action that ameliorates lived social problems.
   Pragmatic constructivists can commit to the Responsibility to Protect
   (R2P) as an idea that might reconcile various communities of normative
   practice and ameliorate vulnerability without upsetting international
   order. To the extent particular practices (e.g., prevention) have proven
   (and continue to prove) useful in doing this, pragmatic constructivists
   can equate the institutionalization of those practices with normative
   progress. However, R2P is a "complex" norm. It recognizes that knowledge
   of how to respond to ongoing atrocity is context specific and cannot
   therefore be fixed. The task of the pragmatic constructivist here is to
   assess the practical judgment of those that claim to speak for the norm
   by weighing the consequences of acting out their prescription in the
   specific context of a particular crisis. I test the meanings of R2P in
   use during the Syria crisis from 2011 to 2012. R2P was problematic to
   the extent certain meanings reinforced policy ends (e.g., protection
   through political/criminal accountability) that were impractical and
   pursued at the expense of non-ideal but realizable goals (e.g.,
   protection through peace/aid).

AB Why do some rebel groups provide governance inclusively while most

   resources to provide benefits to anyone, including nonsupporters (Karen

   no services or limit their service provision to only those people who
   support, or are likely to support, the insurgency. The existing
   literature examines how insurgencies incentivize recruitment by offering
   selective social services, yet no research addresses why insurgencies
   provide goods inclusively. I argue that inclusive provision of services
   legitimates insurgents' claim of sovereignty to domestic and
   international audiences, and thus is a strategic tool secessionist
   rebels use to achieve their long-term goal of independence. With new and
   original data, I use a large-N analysis to test this hypothesis. The
   results of the analysis support the hypothesis, underscoring the
   importance insurgent nonviolent behavior and addressing key issues such

   the most famous findings in international relations scholarship. There
   is little agreement, however, about the mechanism that underpins the
   democratic peace. Recently, scholars have shown that mass publics in
   liberal democracies are less supportive of using military force against
   other democracies. This finding has been taken to support the idea that
   the content of public opinion may provide one mechanism that underpins
   the democratic peace. Using a large-scale survey experiment, we show
   that mass publics in an authoritarian regime-China-show the same
   reluctance to use force against democracies as is found in western
   democracies. Our findings expand the empirical scope of the claim that
   mass publics are reluctant to use force against democracies, but force
   us to rethink how public opinion operates as a causal mechanism
   underpinning the democratic peace.

AB The partial (ceteris paribus) effects of interest in nonlinear and
   interactive linear models are heterogeneous as they can vary
   dramatically with the underlying observed or unobserved covariates.
   Despite the apparent importance of heterogeneity, a common practice in
   modern empirical work is to largely ignore it by reporting average
   partial effects (or, at best, average effects for some groups). While
   average effects provide very convenient scalar summaries of typical
   effects, by definition they fail to reflect the entire variety of the
   heterogeneous effects. In order to discover these effects much more
   fully, we propose to estimate and report sorted effects-a collection of
   estimated partial effects sorted in increasing order and indexed by
   percentiles. By construction, the sorted effect curves completely
   represent and help visualize the range of the heterogeneous effects in
   one plot. They are as convenient and easy to report in practice as the
   conventional average partial effects. They also serve as a basis for
   classification analysis, where we divide the observational units into
   most or least affected groups and summarize their characteristics. We
   provide a quantification of uncertainty (standard errors and confidence
   bands) for the estimated sorted effects and related classification
   analysis, and provide confidence sets for the most and least affected
   groups. The derived statistical results rely on establishing key, new
   mathematical results on Hadamard differentiability of a multivariate
   sorting operator and a related classification operator, which are of
   independent interest. We apply the sorted effects method and
   classification analysis to demonstrate several striking patterns in the
   gender wage gap. We find that this gap is particularly strong for
   married women, ranging from -60% to 0% between the 2% and 98%
   percentiles, as a function of observed and unobserved characteristics;
   while the gap for never married women ranges from -40% to +20%. The most
   adversely affected women tend to be married, do not have college
   degrees, work in sales, and have high levels of potential experience.

AB Many time series exhibit "long memory": Their autocorrelation function
   decays slowly with lag. This behavior has traditionally been modeled via
   unit roots or fractional Brownian motion and explained via aggregation
   of heterogeneous processes, nonlinearity, learning dynamics, regime
   switching, or structural breaks. This paper identifies a different and
   complementary mechanism for long-memory generation by showing that it
   can naturally arise when a large number of simple linear homogeneous
   economic subsystems with short memory are interconnected to form a
   network such that the outputs of the subsystems are fed into the inputs
   of others. This networking picture yields a type of aggregation that is
   not merely additive, resulting in a collective behavior that is richer
   than that of individual subsystems. Interestingly, the long-memory
   behavior is found to be almost entirely determined by the geometry of
   the network, while being relatively insensitive to the specific behavior
   of individual agents.

AB It is generally difficult to know whether the parameters in nonlinear
   econometric models are point-identified. We provide computationally
   attractive procedures to construct confidence sets (CSs) for identified
   sets of the full parameter vector and of subvectors in models defined
   through a likelihood or a vector of moment equalities or inequalities.
   The CSs are based on level sets of "optimal" criterion functions (such
   as likelihoods, optimally-weighted or continuously-updated GMM
   criterions). The level sets are constructed using cutoffs that are
   computed via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations from the quasi-posterior
   distribution of the criterion. We establish new Bernstein-von Mises (or
   Bayesian Wilks) type theorems for the quasi-posterior distributions of
   the quasi-likelihood ratio (QLR) and profile QLR in partially-identified
   models. These results imply that our MC CSs have exact asymptotic
   frequentist coverage for identified sets of full parameters and of
   subvectors in partially-identified regular models, and have valid but
   potentially conservative coverage in models whose local tangent spaces
   are convex cones. Further, our MC CSs for identified sets of subvectors
   are shown to have exact asymptotic coverage in models with
   singularities. We provide local power properties and uniform validity of
   our CSs over classes of DGPs that include point- and
   partially-identified models. Finally, we present two simulation
   experiments and two empirical examples: an airline entry game and a
   model of trade flows.

AB High pollution persists in many developing countries despite strict
   environmental rules. We use a field experiment and a structural model to
   study how plant emission standards are enforced. In collaboration with
   an Indian environmental regulator, we experimentally doubled the rate of
   inspection for treatment plants and required that the extra inspections
   be assigned randomly. We find that treatment plants only slightly
   increased compliance. We hypothesize that this weak effect is due to
   poor targeting, since the random inspections in the treatment found
   fewer extreme violators than the regulator's own discretionary
   inspections. To unbundle the roles of extra inspections and the removal
   of discretion over what plants to target, we set out a model of
   environmental regulation where the regulator targets inspections, based
   on a signal of pollution, to maximize plant abatement. Using the
   experiment to identify key parameters of the model, we find that the
   regulator aggressively targets its discretionary inspections, to the
   degree that half of the plants receive fewer than one inspection per
   year, while plants expected to be the dirtiest may receive ten.
   Counterfactual simulations show that discretion in targeting helps
   enforcement: inspections that the regulator assigns cause three times
   more abatement than would the same number of randomly assigned
   inspections. Nonetheless, we find that the regulator's information on
   plant pollution is poor, and improvements in monitoring would reduce
   emissions.

   system. We focus on long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and the large
   (approximately $13,500) jump in Medicare payments they receive when a
   patient's stay reaches a threshold number of days. Discharges increase
   substantially after the threshold, with the marginal discharged patient
   in relatively better health. Despite the large financial incentives and
   behavioral response in a high mortality population, we are unable to
   detect any compelling evidence of an impact on patient mortality. To
   assess provider behavior under counterfactual payment schedules, we
   estimate a simple dynamic discrete choice model of LTCH discharge
   decisions. When we conservatively limit ourselves to alternative
   contracts that hold the LTCH harmless, we find that an alternative
   contract can generate Medicare savings of about $2,100 per admission, or
   about 5% of total payments. More aggressive payment reforms can generate
   substantially greater savings, but the accompanying reduction in LTCH
   profits has potential out-of-sample consequences. Our results highlight
   how improved financial incentives may be able to reduce healthcare
   spending, without negative consequences for industry profits or patient
   health.

   life-cycle framework, using US CEX data. Heterogeneity is due to
   observables, such as age, wealth, hours worked, and the wage level, as
   well as to unobservable tastes for leisure: the median Marshallian
   elasticity for hours worked is 0.18, with corresponding Hicksian
   elasticity of 0.54 and Frisch elasticity of 0.87. At the 90th
   percentile, these values are 0.79, 1.16, and 1.92. Responses at the
   extensive margin explain about 54% of the total labor supply response
   for women under 30, although this declines with age. Aggregate
   elasticities are higher in recessions, and increase with the length of
   the recession. The heterogeneity at the micro level means that the
   aggregate labor supply elasticity is not a structural parameter: any
   aggregate elasticity will depend on the demographic structure of the

AB Trust creates vulnerability to exploitation. This article approaches
   this paradox by comparing the exploitability of categorical trust within
   social groups to the deterrent effect of categorical distrust between
   rival groups. The empirical setting is a 2008 stockbrokerage fraud
   perpetrated on an ethnically diverse population of investors in Kenya's
   Nairobi Securities Exchange. As expected, investors prefer brokerages
   operated by coethnics and avoid brokerages operated by ethnic rivals,
   but clients coethnic with the corrupt brokerage are not protected from
   victimization in the fraud. Instead, the brokerage's rival-group clients
   receive this protection. Both patterns are primarily seen in
   high-conflict areas rather than being true across all settings.
   Mechanism tests suggest that monitoring stimulated by rivals' distrust
   drives this result, but deepening relational embedding with the
   brokerage attenuates it. A concluding discussion positions these
   findings in the larger social capital literature and considers whether
   social homogeneity might be a causal factor in opportunism.

   collects data on employment structures for much of the modern period to
   study democratization over the same period. In cross-national
   regressions, the author finds evidence that the disruptive capacity of
   nonelites drives democratic gains, and the finding that landlord
   capacity stymies it is reproduced. Counterfactual exercises show that
   slightly more than half of the democracy gap between the developing and
   developed world can be explained by the fact that late development
   bolstered landlords while handicapping nonelites.

AB Who identifies as a world citizen? Many scholars argue that
   transnational connections are the primary conduits for global cultural
   diffusion and, therefore, that affluent residents of the densely
   connected global core should be the most likely to identify with global
   society. However, empirical studies have shown that global
   identification is common on the global periphery. The authors build on
   theories suggesting that individuals may emphasize expansive identities
   when particularistic identities fail to provide a sense of security in
   the face of threat. They argue that members of peripheral and
   marginalized groups express greater global identification because of the
   threat inherent in their precarious social positions. The authors show
   that (1) global identification is more common among residents of weaker
   and more repressive states, (2) members of repressed minority groups are
   more likely to identify with global society than conationals with
   collective access to state power, and (3) many residents of one weak
   stateLebanonexpressed greater enthusiasm for global connection
   immediately following a terrorist attack.

AB The authors propose and test a novel theory of how decisions not to hire
   reproduce gender segregation through what they term proportional
   prejudice. They hypothesize that employers are less likely to hire
   anyone from an applicant pool that contains a large proportion of
   gender-atypical applicantsthat is, those whose gender does not match the
   occupation stereotypeas this leads employers to form negative
   impressions of all pool applicants, regardless of gender. Analyses of
   over 7 million applications for over 700,000 job postings by more than
   200,000 freelancers in an online contract labor market support their
   argument. A supplemental survey experiment isolates the mechanism:
   applicant pools with a larger proportion of gender-atypical applicants
   were evaluated as less likely to contain people who seemed skilled
   enough for the job. The authors conclude by demonstrating how their
   theory reconciles the conflicting findings as to whether gender-atypical
   job seekers are disadvantaged in the hiring process.

AB Demographic and ecological theories yield mixed evidence as to whether
   ethnic enclaves are a benefit or a hindrance to the status attainment of
   residents and entrepreneurs. This article provides one possible
   theoretical resolution by separating the positive effects that may
   emanate among co-ethnic neighbors from the negative effects that may
   result with the concentration of racial or ethnic groups. The theory is
   tested by analyzing occupational wage attainment and entrepreneurship
   among African-Americans between 1880 and 1940, a historical context in
   which Jim Crow laws imposed segregation exogenously. Drawing on
   cross-sectional and panel census data for representative samples of
   blacks in the United States, the results suggest consistent upward
   occupational mobility among residents with same-race neighbors,
   accompanied with downward mobility among residents who are concentrated
   in larger racialized enclaves. Both patterns are also observed in the
   distribution of entrepreneurial activity among blacks during the Jim
   Crow era.

AB Despite modernity's love affair with rationality and the precision that
   supports it, ambiguity persists not only in humor and politics but in
   all areas of contemporary life including scholarship and science. Here
   the authors explore how knowledge cultures differ in their precision of
   expression and the consequences of ambiguity for those cultures. They
   develop, estimate, and validate a model of ambiguous expression from
   large-scale publication data and then show that ambiguous scholarly
   language acts like a boundary object between researchers and their
   communities, drawing competing interpretations into conversation with
   one another as they build on it. Ambiguity, and the uncertainty that
   follows, stimulate social learning and so ironically play a crucial role
   in focusing modern knowledge and creating zones of social and
   intellectual engagement.

AB We analyse a sequential innovation model and show that relatively narrow
   patent rights can facilitate a market in which startups' patents are
   traded as negotiating assets. In this market, the trade of patents, on
   top of monopoly profits, conveys an extra surplus from the patents'
   capacity to affect future tech-transfer negotiations. This surplus,
   which stems from a patent's potential ability to exclude infringers and
   the corresponding enforcement spillovers that patents confer, may
   incentivise innovations that would not have been possible under trade
   secrecy, improving social welfare.

   later years when the world is more highly globalised. Countries
   translate more from others that are culturally similar, but this

   Translations decrease faster with distance in developing countries,

AB Much of the variation in international trade volume is driven by firms'
   extensive margin decisions of whether to participate in export markets.
   We evaluate how the information potential exporters possess influences
   their decisions. We estimate a model of export participation in which
   firms weigh the fixed costs of exporting against the forecasted profits
   from serving a foreign market. We adopt a moment inequality approach,
   placing weak assumptions on firms' expectations. The framework allows us
   to test whether firms differ in the information they have about foreign
   markets. We find that larger firms possess better knowledge of market
   conditions in foreign countries, even when those firms have not exported
   in the past. Quantifying the value of information, we show that, in a
   typical destination, total exports rise while the number of exporters
   falls when firms have access to better information to forecast export
   revenues.

AB Using new narrative measures of exogenous variation in marginal tax
   rates associated with postwar tax reforms in the United States, this
   study estimates short-run tax elasticities of reported income of around
   1.2 based on time series from 1946 to 2012. Estimated elasticities are
   larger in the top 1% of the income distribution but are also positive
   and statistically significant for other income groups. Previous time
   series studies of tax returns data have found little evidence for income
   responses to taxes outside the top of the income distribution. The
   different results in this article arise because of additional efforts to
   account for dynamics, expectations, and especially the endogeneity of
   tax policy decisions. Marginal rate cuts lead to increases in real GDP
   and declines in unemployment. There is also evidence that the responses
   are to marginal tax rates rather than average tax rates. Counterfactual
   tax cuts targeting the top 1% alone are estimated to have short-run
   positive effects on economic activity and incomes outside of the top 1%,
   but to increase inequality in pretax incomes. Cuts for taxpayers outside
   of the top 1% also lead to increases in incomes and economic activity,
   but with a longer delay.

AB Using novel microdata, we document an important, unintended consequence
   of the Protestant Reformation: a reallocation of resources from
   religious to secular purposes. To understand this process, we propose a
   conceptual framework in which the introduction of religious competition
   shifts political markets where religious authorities provide legitimacy
   to rulers in exchange for control over resources. Consistent with our
   framework, religious competition changed the balance of power between
   secular and religious elites: secular authorities acquired enormous
   amounts of wealth from monasteries closed during the Reformation,
   particularly in Protestant regions. This transfer of resources had
   significant consequences. First, it shifted the allocation of upper-tail
   human capital. Graduates of Protestant universities increasingly took
   secular, especially administrative, occupations. Protestant university
   students increasingly studied secular subjects, especially degrees that
   prepared students for public sector jobs, rather than church sector
   specific theology. Second, it affected the sectoral composition of fixed
   investment. Particularly in Protestant regions, new construction shifted
   from religious toward secular purposes, especially the building of
   palaces and administrative buildings, which reflected the increased
   wealth and power of secular lords. Reallocation was not driven by
   preexisting economic or cultural differences. Our findings indicate that
   the Reformation played an important causal role in the secularization of
   the West.

AB Much has been made about the rise in single mother households over the
   past several decades, with significant focus on absent fathers and the
   challenges single mothers face. Black single mother households are often
   the face of this debate. Drawing on 31 in-depth interviews with
   low-income black single mothers of teenagers, we examine the racialized
   gender strategies these mothers develop in their carework. Findings
   reveal that amid current gendered and racialized discourses that
   emphasize the crucial role fathers play in children's lives, and in a
   context of intersecting race, gender, and class inequalities, mothers
   draw heavily on the help of older sons-a phenomenon we call
   "brothermothering"-as well as other men and the symbolic power of male
   authority. We argue that male power in the lives of low-income black
   single mothers poses dilemmas and contradictions, which both support
   mothers in their parenting efforts and reproduce patriarchal
   underpinnings of "the family" based on male dominance. We situate these
   findings within the larger contexts of widespread anxiety about single
   motherhood, dominant beliefs about the roles of "mother" and "father,"
   gendered sexual double standards, and processes of criminalization and
   hyperincarceration that are particularly salient for low-income black
   youth, families, and communities.

AB Racialized and classed "risk" narratives of sexuality in the United
   States construct economically marginalized young women of color as
   sexually precocious, potential teen mothers who are likely to end up as
   burdens on the state. Some scholars underline the utility of recognizing
   reproductive inequalities involved in constructing teen motherhood as an
   unequivocal social problem, and they stress the importance of exploring
   teen mothers' agency in navigating dominant risk narratives. Fewer
   studies analyze how young women who are not pregnant or parenting
   produce, reproduce, and challenge dominant risk narratives about their
   sexuality. Drawing on three years of intensive fieldwork among 13 young
   economically marginalized black and Latina women, I demonstrate how
   feminist ideologies of empowerment interact with pervasive risk
   narratives in the everyday lives of marginalized women coming of age in
   the "shadow of the women's movement." My observations show that the
   young women strategically navigate circulating risk narratives about
   their sexuality by constructing an identity of distance characterized by
   feminist ideals of independence, self-respect, and self-development to
   distance themselves from these narratives. However, as they construct
   this identity of distance, they also stigmatize young mothers and police
   their own bodies and the bodies of their friends and sisters. I draw on
   women-of-color feminism to reflect on the uncomfortable
   relationship-evident in the process of a group of young women's identity
   construction-between feminist ideologies of empowerment and bourgeois
   heteronormativity that marginalizes young women's sexualities by
   constructing teen motherhood as inherently problematic.

AB Scholars have argued convincingly that race influences an individual's
   ability to access and mobilize social capital. Since social capital is
   embedded in social relationships and not individuals, understanding the
   context of relationships is imperative for understanding how race may
   create barriers to socioeconomic equality. Using data from in-depth
   interviews with members of an intentionally interracial organization in
   a large Midwestern city, I investigate the influence of race on social
   capital. One major theme emerged: highly involved white members
   described their close friends of color in utilitarian terms and not
   integrated into daily activities outside of the interracial
   organization. This theme, named the "one friend rule," is a micro-level
   mechanism where whites mobilize a "close" interracial tie to project a
   generalized value for diversity while simultaneously limiting access to
   personal resources. I conclude that the one friend rule is a major
   barrier to social capital mobilization for people of color involved in a
   racially diverse organization.

AB World-systems scholars have recently advanced a framework for the
   analysis of "antisystemic" movements, with one important component of
   this approach being the integration of global forces into causal
   accounts of social movement mobilizations. This perspective, both an
   extension and a critique of existing movement theories such as political
   opportunity structure and political mediation approaches, is an
   outgrowth of the long-running trend of constructing larger and more
   elaborate models of the economic and political structures that bear upon
   movement outcomes. I elaborate three strategies of anti-systemic
   movement analysis, and go on to combine these strategies with Event
   Structure Analysis (ESA) in order to investigate episodes of syndicalist
   mobilization in Argentina in 1917 and Chile in 1923. These cases reveal
   a set of crucial world-scale determinants at work in each mobilization:
   the relations between local and foreign capitalists, fluctuations in the
   world market transmitted through foreign-dominated enclaves, and direct
   and indirect influence by powerful core states such as Britain and the
   US. In contrast to the sorts of nationally-bound causality assumed in
   many social movement theories, I demonstrate that these world-scale
   forces cannot be included merely as external context; instead, they
   actively condition ostensibly "local" actors and are crucial
   determinants of each mobilization's shape.

AB Little is known about the extra-political consequences of contemporary
   U.S.-based nativist mobilization as well as the resilience unauthorized
   migrants display in the face of antiimmigrant mobilization along the
   U.S.-Mexico border. Bringing together social movements and immigration
   literatures, we examine these interrelated issues using original survey
   data from the first wave of the Migrant Border Crossing Study. In so
   doing, we examine: (1) factors influencing repatriated unauthorized
   migrants' awareness of nativist mobilization (i.e., Minutemen) along the
   Arizona-Sonora border, and (2) factors explaining why some migrants
   would or would not be potentially deterred from attempting future
   unauthorized crossings if encountering the Minutemen were a possibility.
   Results from a Heckman probit selection model indicate that higher
   levels of general, financial, and migration-specific human capital are
   associated with awareness of the Minutemen, while higher household
   income and status as an indigenous language speaker predict who would be
   less likely to be deterred from crossing. We also uncover an interesting
   paradox: migrants traveling with coyotes were less likely to have heard
   of Minutemen and more likely to be potentially deterred. Collectively,
   our results provide insight into the overlooked extra-political
   consequences of contemporary U.S. nativist mobilization, how resiliency
   in the face of such a deterrent is structured among repatriated
   unauthorized migrants, and how seemingly powerless migrant groups can
   mitigate potential threats initiated by relatively privileged groups of
   U.S. citizens.

AB This article investigates mechanisms underlying anti-immigrant sentiment
   in post-socialist Russia in particular, and in societies undergoing a
   search for new national identity borders in general. We argue that when
   the borders of national identity are drawn and redefined, the forces
   that drive anti-immigrant attitudes differ meaningfully for members of
   the ethnic majority group and for members of the minority population.
   Our empirical analysis utilizes data obtained from a representative
   sample of the Russian population by the European Social Survey
   (2006-2012). Descriptive data reveal that the level of anti-immigrant
   attitudes among ethnic Russians (the majority population) is higher than
   among non-ethnic Russians (ethnic minority group), reflecting the fact
   that the crisis of national identity in post-socialist Russia has
   undermined, primarily, a sense of group position of ethnic majority. Our
   main findings demonstrate that in post-socialist Russia, as a society
   undergoing the critical period of the reconsideration of national
   identity, the anti-immigrant attitudes of the ethnic majority group rely
   mostly on perceptions of collective (state) vulnerability, while the
   anti-immigrant attitudes of ethnic minority groups rely to a greater
   degree on individuals' vulnerable socioeconomic position, and
   conservative views and ideologies (i.e., self-interests).

AB Using the example of green fields of study in higher education, which
   emerged largely in response to the growing prominence of the
   environmental movement over recent decades, this article posits that new
   and emerging fields of study can be an important source of change in
   gender segregation across fields of study. We suggest that new and
   emerging fields of study, when framed outside of existing gender
   divisions, may transcend established gender divisions and be
   characterized by greater gender integration in both STEM and non-STEM
   disciplines. Patterns of gender segregation among over 9 million
   bachelor's degree recipients between 2009 and 2013 confirm that green
   programs are systematically characterized by greater gender equality
   relative to non-green fields, regardless of their STEM classification.
   Further, the more gender imbalanced the "parent" field, the greater the
   difference we find in the gender composition of green and non-green
   programs. These results imply that green programs are promoting greater
   gender equality across the higher education system, underscoring the

AB Following the 1994 Rwandan genocide, many defendants on trial at the
   International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) testified on their own
   behalf. This article analyzes transcripts of their testimonies to learn
   (1) how defendants discuss the grave crimes of which they are accused,
   and (2) how their explanatory styles allow them to rationalize their
   actions and negotiate their tarnished identities. We find that
   defendants employ Gresham Sykes and David Matza's (1957) classic
   techniques of neutralization as a means of rationalization, impression
   management, and identity negotiation. Nevertheless, these techniques,
   along with those developed in the decades since, do not capture all
   aspects of defendants' accounts. We thus identify additional techniques
   of neutralization to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how
   defendants account for their actions. By extending this classic
   literature, we call attention to the situational context of
   international trials, the nature of the crime of genocide, the
   relatively high social status many defendants once occupied, and
   existing narratives surrounding the legitimacy of the ICTR. In doing so,
   our analysis contributes to understandings of narratives of violence and
   accused genocide perpetrators.

AB Using a reproductive coercion framework, we investigate the role of
   intimate partner violence (IPV) in pregnancy during the transition to
   adulthood. We use two types of data from a population-based sample of
   867 young women in a Michigan county: a 60-minute survey interview with
   2.5 years of weekly follow-up surveys, and semi-structured interviews
   with a subsample of 40 pregnant women. The semi-structured interviews
   illustrate the violence women experienced. Discrete-time logit hazard
   models demonstrate that threats and physical assault are associated with
   higher pregnancy rates during ages 18 to 22. However, this holds only
   when the violence is recent; violence occurring more than a month
   earlier is not associated with higher pregnancy rates. These
   associations are independent of violent experiences with prior partners,
   which are also associated with higher pregnancy rates. Fixed-effects
   models show that during violent weeks, women perceive more pregnancy
   desire from their partners, have more sex, and use less contraception
   than during nonviolent weeks. Finally, mediation analyses and the
   semi-structured interviews are consistent with reproductive coercion:
   violent young men are more likely to want their girlfriends pregnant,
   and they use threats and physical assault to implement their preferences
   via sex and contraceptive non-use, which in turn increase pregnancy
   rates.

AB Toleration is lauded as a chief virtue of contemporary liberalism.
   Without this virtue, it seems, citizens are ill-equipped to reconcile
   ethical disagreements appropriately in pluralistic societies. In recent
   scholarship and practice, however, toleration has undergone significant
   transformation. The tolerant citizen, we are told, avoids causing the
   discomfort or pain associated with uncomfortable conversations,
   criticism, or even difference of opinion. Regrettably, this
   understanding of toleration hinders rather than facilitates dialogue and
   conflates pain or discomfort with cruelty. To offer a more viable
   theoretical grounding for toleration, this article turns to the third
   unnamed virtue of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. When conceptualized as
   an Aristotelian moral virtue with vices of both deficiency and excess,
   it is clear how toleration, taken too far, becomes a vice. Moreover,
   Aristotle's principles of contextual sensitivity, other-regarding
   virtue, and non-cruel pain constitute a better foundation for restoring
   toleration as a healthy virtue for liberal citizens.

AB The connections between narcissism and political orientations have been
   theorized by scholars and increasingly evoked by political parties,
   politicians, public intellectuals, and the media. Yet surprisingly
   little research has been undertaken to empirically asses the veracity of
   these claims. We address this lacuna by identifying the relationship
   between narcissism, political ideologies, and partisanship in a
   nationally representative sample taken days before the 2016 U.S.
   presidential election. Overall, we find those on the left and right are
   equally narcissistic. However, liberals and conservatives differ in
   which dimensions drive their narcissism. Specifically, we find that the
   entitlement facet of narcissism is uniformly related to more
   conservative positions, whereas exhibitionism is related to more liberal
   values, including political party identification. Narcissism, as a
   complex multidimensional construct, has an important role in
   understanding political ideology.

AB Remittances-money migrant workers send back home-are the second largest
   source of international financial flows in developing countries. As with
   other sources of international finance, such as foreign direct
   investment and foreign aid, worker remittances shape politics in
   recipient countries. We examine the political consequences of
   remittances by exploring how they influence antigovernment protest
   behavior. While recent research argues that remittances have a
   pernicious effect on politics by contributing to authoritarian
   stability, we argue the opposite: Remittances increase political protest
   in nondemocracies by augmenting the resources available to potential
   political opponents. Using cross-national data on a latent measure of
   antigovernment political protest, we show that remittances increase
   protest. To explore the mechanism linking remittances to protest, we
   turn to individual-level data from eight nondemocracies in Africa to
   show that remittance receipt increases protest in opposition areas but
   not in progovernment regions.

AB Ethnic diversity is considered detrimental to national unity, especially
   if ethnicity is politically mobilized: Ethnic parties in electoral
   competition in particular are thought to increase the salience of ethnic
   differences and, with it, ethnic tensions. Yet the individual links of
   this psychological chain have only been examined cross-sectionally, and
   never together. This article employs original longitudinal survey data
   to simultaneously assess changes in ingroup identification, outgroup
   aversion, and national identification over the election period within
   one diverse society: Romania. While ingroup identification does
   increase, ethnic relations do not worsen. On the contrary, outgroup
   aversion decreases while national identification increases, for minority
   and majority Romanian citizens alike. I explain these findings with the
   common ingroup identity model from social psychology: Elections in
   ethnically diverse societies may not only increase the salience of
   ethnic groups but also that of the superordinate, national identity. The
   findings question the often assumed automaticity of intergroup threat.

   This article advances an alternative view that emphasizes their enabling

   government performance by resolving principal-agent problems within
   political hierarchies. I substantiate this claim by examining how
   patronage networks shape economic performance of local governments in
   China. Using an original city-level panel data set between 2000 and
   2011, and a new method that identifies patronage ties based on past
   promotions, I show that city leaders with informal ties to the incumbent
   provincial leaders deliver significantly faster economic growth than
   those without. I conduct additional analyses to rule out several
   important alternative explanations and provide evidence on the
   incentive-enhancing mechanism. These findings highlight the importance

AB Immigration scholars have increasingly questioned the idea that
   "illegality" is a fixed, inherent condition. Instead, the new consensus
   is that immigration laws produce "illegality." But can "illegality" be
   socially constructed? When initially judging who is an "illegal
   immigrant," common observers and even authorities typically do not rely
   on an individual's documentation. Instead, people rely on shared
   stereotypes to assign "illegality" to certain bodies, a condition we
   refer to as "social illegality." Ethnographers have documented that
   individual traits like occupation or national-origin may trigger
   illegality suspicions, but it is not clear how widespread these
   stereotypes are, or whether all stereotypes are equally consequential.
   To address this question, we examine the personal attributes shaping
   perceived "illegality." We apply a paired conjoint survey experiment on
   a nationally representative sample of 1,515 non-Hispanic white U.S.
   adults to assess the independent effect of each dimension. We find that
   national origin, social class, and criminal background powerfully shape
   perceptions of illegality. These findings reveal a new source of
   ethnic-based inequalities-"social illegality"-that may potentially
   increase law enforcement scrutiny and influence the decisions of hiring
   managers, landlords, teachers, and other members of the public.

   degree of time involvement in paid work, and their participation in
   different forms of economic activity and inactivity, such as paid work,
   homemaking, and retirement. We pool 21 Labour Force Surveys for the

   (n = 1,815,482). The analysis relies on the Strong Group Decomposability
   property of the Mutual Information index. There are four main findings.
   First, the marketplace is the major contributor to gender segregation.
   Second, over the life course, the evolution of gender segregation
   parallels the inverted U-shaped pattern of the employment rate. Third, a
   tradeoff between occupational and non-occupational sources of
   segregation defines three distinct stages in the life course: the prime
   childbearing years, the years when children are school age, and the
   retirement years. Fourth, to a large extent, women's heterogeneity

   income differences are perceived to be high, the public thinks of larger
   income inequality as legitimate. The phenomenon is explained by the
   system justification motivation and other psychological processes that
   favor existing social arrangements. Three experiments show that personal
   experiences of inequality as well as information regarding
   national-level income inequality can affect which income differences are
   thought of as legitimate. A fourth experiment shows that the system
   justification motivation is a cause of this effect. These results can
   provide an empirical basis for future studies to assume that the public

AB This work presents a direct empirical test of the Breen-Goldthorpe (BG)
   rational choice model applied to social inequalities in access to
   university in Italy. In particular, we assess to what extent secondary
   effects of social background on university enrolment are accounted for
   by families' economic resources and relative risk aversion (RRA), among
   a recent cohort of high school graduates. We also assess the role played
   by students' numeric expectations and general perceptions of university
   costs, the returns to university degrees, and their chances of
   successfully completing university. Compared with existing research, our
   contribution is based on a large-scale longitudinal study covering
   different areas of a new national case, includes a larger set of
   indicators measuring rational choice mechanisms, and proposes a novel
   measurement strategy for the indicator of RRA. The core finding is that
   rational choice mechanisms account for around one fifth of secondary
   effects of social origin in university enrolment. Family's economic
   resources and RRA, the two explanatory mechanisms of the BG model, have
   a limited explanatory power, whereas the perception of the indirect
   costs associated to attending university is more important. Overall,
   high school track plays the most prominent role, thereby indicating
   that-despite the formal 'openness' of the system-a large part of
   inequalities in access to university in Italy are already produced when
   tracking first occurs in upper secondary education.

AB This paper estimates returns to education using a dynamic model of
   educational choice that synthesizes approaches in the structural dynamic
   discrete choice literature with approaches used in the reduced-form
   treatment effect literature. It is an empirically robust middle ground
   between the two approaches that estimates economically interpretable and
   policy-relevant dynamic treatment effects that account for heterogeneity
   in cognitive and noncognitive skills and the continuation values of
   educational choices. Graduating from college is not a wise choice for
   all. Ability bias is a major component of observed educational
   differentials. For some, there are substantial causal effects of
   education at all stages of schooling.

AB Entrepreneurship requires energy and creativity as well as business
   acumen. Some factors that contribute to entrepreneurship decline with
   age, but business skills increase with experience in high-level
   positions. Having too many older workers in society slows
   entrepreneurship. When older workers occupy key positions, they block
   younger workers from acquiring skills. A theory is formulated and tested
   using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data. A one standard deviation
   decrease in a country's median age increases new business formation by
   2.5 percentage points, which is about 40 percent of the mean rate.
   Furthermore, older societies have lower rates of entrepreneurship at
   every age.

AB Researchers investigating causal mechanisms in survey experiments often
   rely on nonrandomized quantities to isolate the indirect effect of
   treatment through these variables. Such an approach, however, requires a
   "selection-on-observables" assumption, which undermines the advantages
   of a randomized experiment. In this paper, we show what can be learned
   about casual mechanisms through experimental design alone. We propose a
   factorial design that provides or withholds information on mediating
   variables and allows for the identification of the overall average
   treatment effect and the controlled direct effect of treatment fixing a
   potential mediator. While this design cannot identify indirect effects
   on its own, it avoids making the selection-on-observable assumption of
   the standard mediation approach while providing evidence for a broader
   understanding of causal mechanisms that encompasses both indirect
   effects and interactions. We illustrate these approaches via two
   examples: one on evaluations of US Supreme Court nominees and the other
   on perceptions of the democratic peace.

AB Automated text analysis allows researchers to analyze large quantities
   of text. Yet, comparative researchers are presented with a big
   challenge: across countries people speak different languages. To address
   this issue, some analysts have suggested using Google Translate to
   convert all texts into English before starting the analysis (Lucas et
   al. 2015). But in doing so, do we get lost in translation? This paper
   evaluates the usefulness of machine translation for bag-of-words models
   such as topic models. We use the europarl dataset and compare
   term-document matrices (TDMs) as well as topic model results from gold
   standard translated text and machine-translated text. We evaluate
   results at both the document and the corpus level. We first find TDMs
   for both text corpora to be highly similar, with minor differences
   across languages. What is more, we find considerable overlap in the set
   of features generated from human-translated and machine-translated
   texts. With regard to LDA topic models, we find topical prevalence and
   topical content to be highly similar with again only small differences
   across languages. We conclude that Google Translate is a useful tool for
   comparative researchers when using bag-of-words text models.

AB Data sets quantifying phenomena of social-scientific interest often use
   multiple experts to code latent concepts. While it remains standard
   practice to report the average score across experts, experts likely vary
   in both their expertise and their interpretation of question scales. As
   a result, the mean may be an inaccurate statistic. Item-response theory
   (IRT) models provide an intuitive method for taking these forms of
   expert disagreement into account when aggregating ordinal ratings
   produced by experts, but they have rarely been applied to cross-national
   expert-coded panel data. We investigate the utility of IRT models for
   aggregating expert-coded data by comparing the performance of various
   IRT models to the standard practice of reporting average expert codes,
   using both data from the V-Dem data set and ecologically motivated
   simulated data. We find that IRT approaches outperform simple averages
   when experts vary in reliability and exhibit differential item
   functioning (DIF). IRT models are also generally robust even in the
   absence of simulated DIF or varying expert reliability. Our findings
   suggest that producers of cross-national data sets should adopt IRT
   techniques to aggregate expert-coded data measuring latent concepts.

AB Words matter in politics. The rhetoric that political elites employ
   structures civic discourse. The emergence of social media platforms as a
   medium of politics has enabled ordinary citizens to express their
   ideological inclinations by adopting the lexicon of political elites.
   This avails to researchers a rich new source of data in the study of
   political ideology. However, existing ideological text-scaling methods
   fail to produce meaningful inferences when applied to the short,
   informal style of textual content that is characteristic of social media
   platforms such as Twitter. This paper introduces the first viable
   approach to the estimation of individual-level ideological positions
   derived from social media content. This method allows us to position
   social media users-be they political elites, parties, or citizens-along
   a shared ideological dimension. We validate the proposed method by
   demonstrating correlation with existing measures of ideology across
   various political contexts and multiple languages. We further
   demonstrate the ability of ideological estimates to capture derivative
   signal by predicting out-of-sample, individual-level voting intentions.
   We posit that social media data can, when properly modeled, better
   capture derivative signal than discrete scales used in more traditional
   survey instruments.

AB A key finding in the political economy literature is that political

   previous studies posit that such biases are driven by politicians'
   motivations to target benefits directly to certain groups of ordinary
   voters, this article develops the argument that national politicians
   also target pork along partisan lines to win over politicians at lower
   levels of government whose cooperation they need to ensure the
   successful implementation of development projects. Using a
   quasi-experimental design, the argument is tested with data on thousands
   of public works projects sanctioned by MPs in North India. The results
   show that, even controlling for unobserved differences in voter
   characteristics, MPs systematically favored the constituencies of
   co-partisan state legislators when allocating pork specifically under
   conditions implied by the argument and not otherwise. These results shed
   new light on the reasons for partisan biases in resource allocation in

AB Scholars have long attributed the income-participation gap-which is the

   income-based differences in the resources, recruitment, mobilization,
   and psychology underpinning political behavior. I argue that these
   explanations require a longer time horizon than the empirical evidence
   permits. Education, for example, typically ends in young adulthood and
   so cannot logically mediate the effect of income on participation in
   late adulthood. To resolve this temporal problem, I propose that there
   are two income-participation gaps: one based on current economic status
   and another on childhood economic history. I situate this argument in a
   developmental framework and present evidence for it using six studies.
   The results, while mixed at times, indicate that there are two gaps,
   that the size of each gap changes over the life course, and that their
   joint effect creates a larger income-participation gap than estimated by
   prior research.

   use unsupervised methods to recover a latent dimension that best
   explains patterns in giving, donation patterns are instead mapped onto a
   target measure of legislative voting behavior. Supervised models
   significantly outperform alternative measures of ideology in predicting
   legislative voting behavior. Fundraising prior to entering office
   provides a highly informative signal about future voting behavior.
   Impressively, forecasts based on fundraising as a nonincumbent predict
   future voting behavior as accurately as in-sample forecasts based on
   votes cast during a legislator's first 2 years in Congress. The combined
   results demonstrate campaign contributions are powerful predictors of

   Convention assuming the Convention limited itself to the rules proposed.
   Using each state's vote share as a measure of state preference, we find
   that the stability of legislative apportionment depended upon the states
   making decisions. Equal apportionment was in equilibrium with 13 states
   present, as in the Continental Congress, but when Rhode Island and New
   Hampshire were absent during the first third of the Convention, all
   rules were in a top cycle. With New York departing near the middle of
   the Convention, equal apportionment and the Three-Fifths Clause both
   became stable, and the Great Compromise was reached. We conclude that
   the Great Compromise was partly the result of historical contingency
   (i.e., which states participated), rather than necessity.

   case of the U.S. civil rights movement, I develop a theory in which
   protests can shift attitudes and these attitudes can persist. Data from
   over 150,000 survey respondents provide evidence consistent with the
   theory. Whites from counties that experienced historical civil rights
   protests are more likely to identify as Democrats and support
   affirmative action, and less likely to harbor racial resentment against
   blacks. These individual-level results are politically
   meaningful-counties that experienced civil rights protests are

   To identify the causal impact of the import shock, we instrument imports
   to Europe using Chinese imports to the United States. At the district
   level, a stronger import shock leads to (1) an increase in support for
   nationalist and isolationist parties, (2) an increase in support for
   radical-right parties, and (3) a general shift to the right in the

AB Recent emphasis on credible causal designs has led to the expectation
   that scholars justify their research designs by testing the plausibility
   of their causal identification assumptions, often through balance and
   placebo tests. Yet current practice is to use statistical tests with an
   inappropriate null hypothesis of no difference, which can result in
   equating nonsignificant differences with significant homogeneity.
   Instead, we argue that researchers should begin with the initial
   hypothesis that the data are inconsistent with a valid research design,
   and provide sufficient statistical evidence in favor of a valid design.
   When tests are correctly specified so that difference is the null and
   equivalence is the alternative, the problems afflicting traditional
   tests are alleviated. We argue that equivalence tests are better able to
   incorporate substantive considerations about what constitutes good
   balance on covariates and placebo outcomes than traditional tests. We
   demonstrate these advantages with applications to natural experiments.

   with respect to background features of the scenario. IE is often
   violated because subjects, when presented with information about one
   attribute, update their beliefs about others too. Labeling a country 'a
   democracy,' for example, affects subjects' beliefs about the country's
   geographic location. When IE is violated, the effect of the manipulation
   need not correspond to the quantity of interest (the effect of beliefs
   about the focal attribute). We formally define the IE assumption,
   relating it to the exclusion restriction in instrumental-variable
   analysis. We show how to predict IE violations ex ante and diagnose them
   ex post with placebo tests. We evaluate three strategies for achieving
   IE. Abstract encouragement is ineffective. Specifying background details
   reduces imbalance on the specified details and highly correlated
   details, but not others. Embedding a natural experiment in the scenario
   can reduce imbalance on all background beliefs, but raises other issues.
   We illustrate with four survey experiments, focusing on an extension of
   a prominent study of the democratic peace.

AB Instruments based on realizations of the endogenous variable in other
   units-for instance, regional or global weighted averages-are commonly
   used in political science. Such spatial instruments have proved
   attractive: they are convenient to obtain, typically have power, and are
   plausibly exogenous. We argue that the assumptions underlying spatial
   instruments remain poorly understood and challenge whether spatial
   instruments can satisfy the conditions required for valid instruments.
   First, when cross-unit dependence exists in the endogenous predictor,
   other cross-unit relationships-spillovers and interdependence-likely
   exist as well and risk violations of the exclusion restriction. Second,
   spatial instruments produce simultaneity in the first-stage equation, as
   left-hand side outcomes are included as right-hand side predictors.
   Because the instrument and the endogenous variable are simultaneously
   determined, the exclusion restriction is, necessarily and by
   construction, violated. Taken together, these concerns lead us to
   conclude that spatial instruments are rarely, if ever, valid.

AB Research on the division of paid and unpaid work at the transition to
   parenthood has rarely been able to separate the social construction of
   gender and motherhood/fatherhood identities from labour market and
   financial factors. By bringing in female same-sex couples (SSC) and
   comparing how the transition to parenthood influences the division of
   parental leave in SSC and different-sex couples (DSC), we can isolate
   parents' gender as a predictor of the division of care from
   physiological and identity-forming aspects linked to being a
   birth-mother (or her partner). Analysing Swedish register data for
   couples who had their first child in 2003-2011, results show that (i)
   the (birth) mother's leave uptake is higher than the partner's uptake
   for both SSC and DSC, providing support for identity formation and
   internalized norms linked to the child's need of its (birth) mother;
   (ii) birth-mothers in SSC on average take 7 weeks less parental leave
   than mothers in DSC, indicating that the partner's gender plays a role;
   and (iii) the (birth) mother's parental leave share is negatively
   related to her income but unrelated to her partner's income, suggesting
   that her labour market prospects are more important in the division of
   leave than any financial, family-utility maximization.

AB This study examines the risk of separation over union duration. Previous
   research reports a rising-falling pattern of divorce risk over marriage
   duration consistent with psychological notions of 'honeymoon' and
   'seven-year itch'. Little is known about the variation of the separation
   risk over cohabitation duration or over marriage duration when the
   length of partnership is measured from the beginning of coresidence. We
   include data on non-marital and marital unions and propose a novel way
   of treating cohabitation and marriage as episodes of the same union. We
   use Finnish large-scale register data and control for individuals'
   observed and unobserved characteristics. Our results show that in
   cohabitations, the separation rate is highest at the beginning of union.
   Entry into marriage is followed by a significant drop in separation
   levels and a modest rising-falling pattern, which is independent of the
   length of premarital cohabitation. Marriage entails permanence, with a
   short 'honeymoon' effect and a long-term 'effect', much of which
   probably reflects self-selection of committed and satisfied cohabiters
   to marriage.

AB On average, people who retire earlier die sooner, partly because poor
   health is an important reason for early retirement. Several theories
   also predict that retirement is detrimental to health and increases
   mortality, and that retirement should affect people in different
   occupations differently. Yet, there is apparently no consensus about the
   causal relationship between retirement and mortality. We treat a
   Norwegian pension reform that lowered retirement eligibility age by 3
   years in 1973 as a natural experiment. The reform affected virtually the
   entire elderly working population. We estimate the long-term effect of
   retirement age and the short-term effect of retirement eligibility using
   instrumental variables and difference-in-differences methods. The
   results show that neither earlier retirement nor retirement eligibility
   affect male mortality substantially. Analyses by educational level and
   occupational groups show no occupational or educational differences in
   the effect of retirement on mortality. We also argue that the 1973
   reform serves as a critical case, a situation where we should be able to
   identify an effect if there were one. In other words, this study
   provides strong evidence that retirement does not have a causal effect
   on male mortality.

AB This study analyses how the daily activities of children and adolescents
   differ by parents' work schedules, using data from the '2009-10 Spanish
   Time Use Survey' (N = 913). Spain is an interesting institutional
   context for its widespread evening-work culture, combined with
   inflexible and gendered work-family arrangements. Results imply that
   parents' time availability, family resources, and gender roles
   significantly influence children's daily activities. Multivariate linear
   regression models reveal that parental evening work is detrimental for
   children's developmental time use, but in ways that differ remarkably
   across parent's gender and social background. On a given weekday,
   children with evening-work mothers spend 35 minutes less on educational
   and social activities with parents and 26 minutes more on unsupervised
   screen-based activities (TV, mobile devices, computers), compared to
   children with standard-work mothers. Yet, such effects are confined to
   evening-work mothers with lower levels of education. By contrast,
   children with highly educated mothers actively engage in educational
   activities, reducing screen-based time. Fathers' work schedules do not
   affect children's time use, while their education levels produce mixed
   results. Analyses for weekends show a clear 'compensatory' behaviour: on
   weekends, children whose mothers work evening hours during weekdays
   substantially increase their time spent in educational activities and
   parent-child socializing.

AB Based on rational choice theory, the present study investigates whether
   changes in students' evaluation of benefits, costs, and probability of
   success related with higher education (HE) causally affect their
   enrolment plans. Moreover, the study aims to test if social inequality
   in access to HE would be reduced by counterbalancing students'
   evaluations of rational choice factors across social origins. For these
   purposes, we conducted a factorial survey, making it possible to
   experimentally vary benefits, costs, and probability of success
   associated with HE to draw causal inferences about students' intention
   to enrol in HE, and to validate findings by means of a traditional
   survey. Results of multilevel analyses provide support for rational
   choice theory and its predictions. While benefits and probability of
   success were found to be positive predictors, costs were negatively
   related to the intention to enrol in HE. Besides, we found empirical
   evidence for the interaction between students' probability of success
   and perceived benefits, and the investment risk expressed as ratio
   between costs and probability of success. Finally, results indicate that
   social inequality, as identified in the traditional survey, might be
   reduced if perceived benefits, costs, and probabilities of success were
   balanced among social origins.

AB Migration scholars often assume migrants are the most ambitious and
   motivated individuals of their home countries. Yet research on
   motivational selectivity is scant. We present the first systematic
   cross-national analysis of migrants' selectivity on achievement-related
   motivational orientations (ARMOs). We measure ARMOs using a validated
   scale that combines orientations towards socioeconomic success, risk,
   and money. Matching the European Social Survey and the World Value
   Survey cumulative data sets, we examine whether international migrants
   recently arrived in Europe are more achievement-oriented than those
   observational equivalents that do not migrate. We focus on migrants from
   nine different origins (France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland,
   Romania, Turkey, Morocco, Brazil, and Andean countries) sampled at
   different European destinations varying in gross domestic product, type
   of welfare state, and linguistic distance. Our findings seem to
   contradict the arguments about a common migrant personality put forward
   by social psychologists, as well as most of the predictions of standard
   economic models. We do find, however, some support for the welfare
   magnet hypothesis, as well as for the expectation that gender
   traditionalism favours negative selectivity of migrant women. We show
   that reported estimates are not driven by educational selectivity and
   are unlikely to be biased by destination effects.

AB Previous research from the United States suggests that volunteers' time

   have risen. Scholars have offered various possible explanations for this
   trend, including generational differences, socio-economic changes, and
   family life changes. In Europe, previous research has shown that
   participation rates have risen in most countries, but little work has
   addressed trends in volunteers' time contributions. In this article, we
   use survey data from Denmark merged with data from administrative
   registers covering the 2004-2012 period to show that, similar to the
   trend in the United States, Danish volunteers' time contributions have
   declined as participation rates have risen. Our results suggest that
   this decline is partially explained not by socio-economic or family life
   changes but by weakening organizational attachment measured by a decline
   in volunteers' propensities to be members of the organizations for which
   they volunteer. On these grounds, we argue that an important consequence
   of weakening organizational attachment is that volunteers' contributions
   of time decline.

AB Combining ethnographic and statistical methods, this study identifies
   interlocking mechanisms that help explain how disadvantaged
   neighborhoods influence their residents' political capacity. Support
   systems that arise in low-income neighborhoods promote social
   interaction that helps people make ends meet, but these systems also
   expose residents to heavy doses of adversity, which dampens perceptions
   of collective political capacity. For the poorest residents of these
   neighborhoods in particular, the expected positive effect of informal
   social support is suppressed by the negative effect of perceived trauma.
   These findings present a micro-level account of poverty, social
   interaction, and political capacity, one that holds implications for
   scholarship and public policy on participatory inequality.

AB Network models of diffusion predominantly think about cultural variation
   as a product of social contagion. But culture does not spread like a
   virus. We propose an alternative explanation we call associative
   diffusion. Drawing on two insights from research in cognition-that
   meaning inheres in cognitive associations between concepts, and that
   perceived associations constrain people's actions-we introduce a model
   in which, rather than beliefs or behaviors, the things being transmitted
   between individuals are perceptions about what beliefs or behaviors are
   compatible with one another. Conventional contagion models require the
   assumption that networks are segregated to explain cultural variation.
   We show, in contrast, that the endogenous emergence of cultural
   differentiation can be entirely attributable to social cognition and
   does not require a segregated network or a preexisting division into
   groups. Moreover, we show that prevailing assumptions about the effects
   of network topology do not hold when diffusion is associative.

AB Why might observers label one social actor's questionable act a norm
   violation even as they seem to excuse similar behavior by others? To
   answer this question, I use participant-observer data on Los Angeles
   stand-up comics to explore the phenomenon of joke theft. Informal,
   community-based systems govern the property rights pertaining to jokes.
   Most instances of possible joke theft are ambiguous owing to the
   potential for simultaneous and coincidental discovery. I find that
   accusations are not strongly coupled to jokes' similarity, and
   enforcement depends mainly on the extent to which insiders view the
   comic in question as being authentic to the community. Comics who are
   oriented toward external rewards, have a track record of anti-social
   behavior, and exhibit lackluster on-stage craft are vulnerable to joke
   theft accusations even in borderline cases because those inauthentic
   characteristics are typical of transgressors. Vulnerability is greatest
   for comics who enjoy commercial success despite low peer esteem.
   Authenticity protects comics because it reflects community-based status,
   which yields halo effects while encouraging relationships predicated on
   respect. In exploring accusations of joke theft and their outcomes, this
   study illustrates how norms function more as framing devices than as
   hard-and-fast rules, and how authenticity shapes their enforcement.

AB This study examines women's use of egg freezing as a tool to renegotiate
   the relationship between romantic and reproductive trajectories and
   temporalities. We interviewed 52 participants who were considering
   freezing their eggs, were in the process of freezing their eggs, had
   already frozen their eggs, or had considered freezing their eggs and
   chose not to do so. We find that most of our participants used egg
   freezing to disentangle the trajectory of finding a partner from the
   trajectory of having children, with the end goal of bundled marriage and
   childbearing. For some participants, this temporary disentangling is an
   intermediate step toward fully decoupling these trajectories through
   single parenthood. Using this critical case, we move beyond previous
   work on sequencing and timing in the life course by focusing on (1)
   individuals' subjective experiences of time and (2) the ways women
   manage and manipulate time in the life course. Finally, we show how
   these theoretical tools can be used to better understand other empirical
   cases in the life course.

AB Over the past decade, millions of refugees have fled their countries of
   origin and asked for asylum abroad. Some of these refugees do not
   receive asylum, but are not deported. Instead they are detained, or
   denied basic rights of residency, some forced into enclosed camps.
   Hoping to escape such conditions, they wish to return to unsafe
   countries, and ask for help from non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
   and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In such cases,
   should NGOs and the UN assist refugees to return? Drawing on original
   data gathered in South Sudan, and existing data from around the world, I
   argue that they should assist with return if certain conditions are met.
   First, the UN and NGOs must try to put an end to coercive conditions
   before helping with return. Secondly, helping with return must not
   encourage the government to expand the use of coercive policies to
   encourage more to return. Finally, NGOs and the UN must ensure that
   refugees are fully informed of the risks of returning. Organizations
   must either conduct research in countries of origin or lobby the
   government to allow refugees to visit their countries of origin before
   making a final decision.

AB Cascade models explain the roles of the intrepid few who initiate
   protest and the masses who join when the expected utility of dissent
   flips from negative to positive. Yet questions remain about what
   motivates participation between those points on the causal chain, or
   under any conditions of high risk. To explain these anomalies, this
   article employs theories of moral identity to explore the
   interdependence of a facet of decision making that rationalist models
   typically regard as fixed: individuals' awareness of and need to express
   values central to their sense of self. Three mechanisms describe ways
   that individuals' responses to early risers trigger moral identity-based
   motivations for protest. First, by conjuring normative ideals, first
   movers can activate bystanders' urge to follow their example in order to
   earn their own self-respect. Secondly, by demonstrating the joy of
   agency, early risers can inspire bystanders' desire to experience the
   same gratification. Thirdly, by absorbing punishments, early risers can
   activate onlookers' sense of moral obligation to contribute to
   collective efforts. These mechanisms redouble bystanders' sense of the
   inherent value of protest, apart from its instrumental utility, and
   intensify their acceptance of risks, independent of the actual risks
   anticipated. Original interviews with displaced Syrians about their
   participation in demonstrations illustrate these processes.

AB Conventional wisdom holds that languages, as ethnic markers, build
   communities with shared preferences and strong social networks.
   Consequently, ethnolinguistic homogeneity can facilitate growth. This
   article challenges this conception of language as a cultural marker. It
   argues that language is also a practical vehicle of communication;
   people can be multilingual, and second languages can be learned. Hence
   language boundaries are neither (1) congruent with ethnic boundaries nor
   (2) static. If true, the purported advantages of ethnolinguistic
   homogeneity should also be evident in countries with large populations
   of non-native speakers conversant in official languages. The study tests
   this hypothesis using an original cross-national and time-variant
   measure that captures both mother-tongue speakers and second-language
   learners. The empirical results are consistent with the understanding of
   language as an efficiency-enhancing instrument: countries with
   exogenously high levels of heterogeneity can avoid the growth tragedy'
   (1) by endogenously teaching the official language in schools.

AB In theory, states can gain security by acquiring internal arms or

   some studies find arms and allies to be substitutes, while others find
   them to be complements. This article contends that these conflicting
   findings are due to scholars failing to consider how regime type
   influences the choice between arms and allies. Since democracies are
   highly credible allies, states that form alliances with democracies can
   confidently reduce their internal arms. This is not the case when states
   form alliances with non-democracies. This study evaluates the argument
   using data on military expenditures and defense pacts from 1950 to 2001.
   Taking steps to account for the potentially endogenous relationship
   between arms and allies, it finds that democratic alliances are
   associated with lower levels of military spending.

   that peacekeepers are deployed on the frontline: they go where conflict

   peacekeepers tend to be deployed near major urban areas.

   economic well-being. Using data from the British Household Panel Study,
   this article finds that taller individuals are more likely to support
   the Conservative Party, support conservative policies and vote
   Conservative; a one-inch increase in height increases support for
   Conservatives by 0.6 per cent. As an extension, the study employs height
   as an instrumental variable for income, and finds that each additional
   thousand pounds of annual income translates into a 2-3 percentage point
   increase in the probability of supporting the Conservatives, and that
   income drives political beliefs and voting in the same direction.

AB Amid growing evidence of unequal democracy' in the United States, labor
   unions can play a potentially important role by ensuring that low-income
   citizens' opinions receive more equal consideration when elected
   officials make policy decisions. To investigate this possibility, this
   article evaluates the relationship between labor union strength and
   representational equality across states and finds evidence that states
   with higher levels of union membership weigh citizens' opinions more
   equally in the policy-making process. In contrast, there is no
   relationship between the volume of labor union contributions to
   political campaigns in a state and the equality of its political
   representation. These findings suggest that labor unions promote greater
   political equality primarily by mobilizing their working-class members
   to political action and, more broadly, underscore the important role
   that organized labor continues to play in shaping the distribution of
   political power across American society.

AB We propose a method for using instrumental variables (IV) to draw

   by the instrument at hand. Policy relevance and external validity turn
   on the ability to do this reliably. Our method exploits the insight that
   both the IV estimand and many treatment parameters can be expressed as
   weighted averages of the same underlying marginal treatment effects.
   Since the weights are identified, knowledge of the IV estimand generally
   places some restrictions on the unknown marginal treatment effects, and
   hence on the values of the treatment parameters of interest. We show how
   to extract information about the treatment parameter of interest from
   the IV estimand and, more generally, from a class of IV-like estimands
   that includes the two stage least squares and ordinary least squares
   estimands, among others. Our method has several applications. First, it
   can be used to construct nonparametric bounds on the average causal
   effect of a hypothetical policy change. Second, our method allows the
   researcher to flexibly incorporate shape restrictions and parametric
   assumptions, thereby enabling extrapolation of the average effects for
   compliers to the average effects for different or larger populations.
   Third, our method can be used to test model specification and hypotheses
   about behavior, such as no selection bias and/or no selection on gain.

AB In French parliamentary and local elections, candidates ranked first and
   second in the first round automatically qualify for the second round,
   while a third candidate qualifies only when selected by more than 12.5
   percent of registered citizens. Using a fuzzy RDD around this threshold,
   we find that the third candidate's presence substantially increases the
   share of registered citizens who vote for any candidate and reduces the
   vote share of the top two candidates. It disproportionately harms the
   candidate ideologically closest to the third and causes her defeat in
   one fifth of the races. Additional evidence suggests that these results
   are driven by voters who value voting expressively over voting
   strategically for the top-two candidate they dislike the least to ensure
   her victory; and by third candidates who, absent party-level agreements
   leading to their dropping out, value the benefits associated with
   competing in the second round more than influencing its outcome.

AB In the unconditional moment restriction model of Hansen (1982),
   specification tests and more efficient estimators are both available
   whenever the number of moment restrictions exceeds the number of
   parameters of interest. We show that a similar relationship between
   potential refutability of a model and existence of more efficient
   estimators is present in much broader settings. Specifically, a
   condition we name local overidentification is shown to be equivalent to
   both the existence of specification tests with nontrivial local power
   and the existence of more efficient estimators of some smooth parameters
   in general semi/nonparametric models. Under our notion of local
   overidentification, various locally nontrivial specification tests such
   as Hausman tests, incremental Sargan tests (or optimally weighted quasi
   likelihood ratio tests) naturally extend to general semi/nonparametric
   settings. We further obtain simple characterizations of local
   overidentification for general models of nonparametric conditional
   moment restrictions with possibly different conditioning sets. The
   results are applied to determining when semi/non-parametric models with
   endogeneity are locally testable, and when nonparametric plug-in and
   semiparametric two-step GMM estimators are semiparametrically efficient.
   Examples of empirically relevant semi/nonparametric structural models
   are presented.

AB More and more economists are finding both empirical and experimental
   evidence of economic behavior that is well beyond classical economics.
   In particular, empirical evidence (Jullien and Salanie (2000)) and
   experimental evidence (Kahneman and Tversky (1979)) supported the
   importance of risk loving, ambiguity loving, and related behavior in
   economics. However, these types of preferences have not been analyzed in
   the general equilibrium literature with a finite number of agents
   because non-convexity of preferences creates difficulty in proving
   existence of equilibrium. The main result in this paper provides a set
   of conditions under which equilibrium exists in such economies.
   We show that uncertainty of aggregate wealth, as well as some dominance
   of the endowment of the risk averters in the economy, play a role in the
   existence of Arrow-Debreu equilibria. This result can be extended to
   ambiguity in the sense of CEU, Smooth Ambiguity, and Variational
   Preference.

AB We study commodity taxation and characterize the Laffer curve, a
   trade-off between tax rates and revenue, in noncompetitive markets.
   Pricing in these markets leads to incomplete tax pass-through and agents
   re optimize their purchase and pricing decisions in response to any tax
   change. We use detailed data from Pennsylvania, a state that monopolizes
   retail sales of alcoholic beverages, to estimate a model of demand for
   horizontally differentiated products that ties consumers' demographic
   characteristics to heterogeneous preferences for spirits. We find that
   under the state's current tax policy, spirits are overpriced. Distillers
   respond to decreases in the tax rate by increasing wholesale prices,
   which limits the state's revenue gain to only 13% of the incremental tax
   revenue predicted under the common assumption of perfect competition.
   The strategic response of noncompetitive firms to changes in taxation
   therefore flattens the Laffer curve significantly.

AB We propose a model of trade in over-the-counter (OTC) markets in which
   each dealer with private information can engage in bilateral
   transactions with other dealers, as determined by her links in a
   network. Each dealer's strategy is represented as a quantity-price
   schedule. We analyze the effect of trade decentralization and adverse
   selection on information diffusion, expected profits, trading costs, and
   welfare. Information diffusion through prices is not affected by
   dealers' strategic trading motives, and there is an informational
   externality that constrains the informativeness of prices. Trade
   decentralization can both increase or decrease welfare. A dealer's
   trading cost is driven by both her own and her counterparties'
   centrality. Central dealers tend to learn more, trade more at lower
   costs, and earn higher expected profit.

AB This paper analyzes a general equilibrium economy featuring input-output
   connections, imperfect competition, and external economies of scale
   owing to entry and exit. The interaction of input-output networks with
   industry-level market structure affects the amplification of shocks and
   the pattern of diffusion in the model, generating cascades of firm entry
   and exit across the economy. In this model, sales provide a poor measure
   of the systemic importance of industries. Unlike the relevant notions of
   centrality in competitive constant-returns-to-scale models, systemic
   importance depends on the industry's role as both a supplier and a
   consumer of inputs, as well as the market structure of industries. A
   basic calibration of the model suggests that aggregate output is three
   times more volatile in response to labor productivity shocks when
   compared to a perfectly competitive model.

AB Measurements of ambiguity attitudes have so far focused on artificial
   events, where (subjective) beliefs can be derived from symmetry of
   events and can be then controlled for. For natural events as relevant in
   applications, such a symmetry and corresponding control are usually
   absent, precluding traditional measurement methods. This paper
   introduces two indexes of ambiguity attitudes, one for aversion and the
   other for insensitivity/perception, for which we can control for
   likelihood beliefs even if these are unknown. Hence, we can now measure
   ambiguity attitudes for natural events. Our indexes are valid under many
   ambiguity theories, do not require expected utility for risk, and are
   easy to elicit in practice. We use our indexes to investigate time
   pressure under ambiguity. People do not become more ambiguity averse
   under time pressure but become more insensitive (perceive more
   ambiguity). These findings are plausible and, hence, support the
   validity of our indexes.

AB This article argues that local minority groups are better able to
   initiate and sustain underground movements because members form isolated
   hubs of commitment that are able to overcome the clandestine collective
   action dilemma, that is, the dual challenge of secrecy and mobilization.
   The author substantiates this claim with a case study of resistance
   against the Holocaust. He combines a unique and underutilized collection
   of postwar testimonies gathered in light of an honorary pension program
   with postwar trials of pro-Nazi collaborators and literature on
   nonrescuers, to trace both successful and failed rescue attempts. In
   line with the theory, the analysis reveals that Catholic rescue groups
   were more successful in Protestant regions and vice versa because their
   minority position facilitated mobilization while reducing exposure.
   Statistical analyses of postwar testimonies and arrest records confirm
   this picture, demonstrating that it is the distinctive local position of
   groups that enables the production of underground movements.

   might also provoke new forms of repression. Using a longitudinal study
   of repression against AIDS activism in China between 1989 and 2013, the
   author proposes that transnational institutions' provision of material
   resources and reshaping of organizational rules can transform a domestic
   repressive apparatus in specific policy areas. The intervention of
   transnational AIDS institutions not only constrained traditional violent
   coercion but also generated new forms of diplomatic repression through
   (1) changing repressive motives by moving AIDS from the margin to the
   center of mainstream politics and (2) supplying resources, networks, and
   models of action that enabled government organizations to reformulate
   health social organizations as new repressive actors with innovative
   repertoires of strategies inside and outside China's territory.

AB In 1868, the state of Georgia began punishing convicts by leasing them
   to private companies. Georgia's transition from penitentiary confinement
   to convict leasing coincided with a shift in the composition of its
   inmates. Fifteen years after the Civil War, African-Americans in Georgia
   were imprisoned at a rate more than 12 times that of whites. This
   article finds that black men were most likely to be imprisoned in the
   convict lease system where they overcame whites' efforts to preserve
   their position as dependent agricultural laborers. Where elite white
   landowners were able to reconstitute a dependent agricultural labor
   force, they had little reason to use the convict lease system to punish
   their workers. But in urban counties and in counties where
   African-Americans had acquired considerable landholdings, black men
   faced comparatively high rates of imprisonment for property crimes.

   among heterogeneous subjective voices, both living and dead. Four social
   processes of memory assembly are involved: individual memories, changing
   perspectives, symmetry, and resonance. Iterated stories about characters
   in the past construct layered identities for narrators in the present by
   synchronizing them into multiple time registers: phenomenological time,
   episodic time, narrative time, epistemological time, projective time,
   and historical time. Different selves within the same person, Faulkner
   implies, emerge from these six ways of remembering, which brains and

AB Environmental justice and social movements scholarship demonstrates how
   not-in-my-backyard activism by more privileged communities leaves the
   disadvantaged with locally unwanted land uses. Yet it overlooks
   instances of local support for risky industries. Our ethnographic case
   shows how a rural, white, mixed-income Pennsylvania community adopted a
   please-in-my-backyard stance toward shale gas extraction (fracking).
   Residents invited development on their land and supported it through
   quiet mobilization. While landowners prioritized benefits over risks,
   economics cannot fully explain their enthusiasm. Consistent with public
   opinion research, partisan identities and community obligations
   undergirded industry support even when personal benefits were limited.
   Devotion to self-reliance and property rights led residents to defend
   landowners' freedom to lease their land. Cynicism toward government
   precluded endorsing environmental regulation, and the perception of
   antifracking activists as liberal outsiders linked support for fracking
   with community solidarity. This case illustrates why communities may
   champion risky industries and complicates theories of nonmobilization.

AB The unequal spatial distribution of crime is an enduring feature of
   cities. While research suggests that spatial diffusion processes
   heighten this concentration, the actual mechanisms of diffusion are not
   well understood as research rarely measures the ways in which people,
   groups, and behaviors connect neighborhoods. This study considers how a
   particular behavior, criminal co-offending, creates direct and indirect
   pathways between neighborhoods. Analyzing administrative records and
   survey data, the authors find that individual acts of co-offending link
   together to create a network of neighborhoods, facilitating the
   diffusion of crime over time and across space and, in so doing, create
   pathways between all Chicago neighborhoods. Statistical analyses
   demonstrate that these neighborhood networks are (1) stable over time;
   (2) generated by important structural characteristics, social processes,
   and endogenous network properties; and (3) a better predictor of the
   geographic distribution of crime than traditional spatial models.

AB How is global-North predominance in the making of organized knowledge
   affected by the rise of new domains of research? This question is
   examined empirically in three interdisciplinary areas - climate change,
   HIV-AIDS, and gender studies - through interviews with 70 researchers in
   Southern-tier countries Brazil, South Africa and Australia. The study
   found that the centrality of the North was reinstituted as these domains
   came into existence, through resource inequalities, workforce
   mechanisms, and intellectual framing. Yet there are tensions in the
   global economy of knowledge, around workforce formation, hierarchies of
   disciplines, neoliberal management strategies, and mismatches with
   social need. Intellectual workers in the Southern tier have built
   significant research centres, workforces and some distinctive knowledge
   projects. These create wider possibilities of change in the global
   structure of organized knowledge production.

   cognitive and educational attainment mediate the link between social
   origins and elite social class destinations in mid-life. Using the 1970
   British Cohort Study (BCS70), we assess the roles of a range of pathways
   through which educational advantage may lead to occupational attainment:
   cognitive development; private and selective secondary schools; school
   level qualifications; and higher education, including institution and
   field of study. Whereas past research has shown a residual direct effect
   of social origins on class destinations, we find that, once a
   sufficiently detailed picture of educational attainment is taken into
   account, education fully explains the link between social origins and
   top social class destinations. In contrast, the gap between men and
   women in achieving top social class positions is in no part accounted
   for by education.

AB Bilateral defense cooperation agreements, or DCAs, are now the most
   common form of institutionalized defense cooperation. These formal
   agreements establish broad defense-oriented legal frameworks between
   signatories, facilitating cooperation in such fundamental areas as
   defense policy coordination, research and development, joint military
   exercises, education and training, arms procurement, and exchange of
   classified information. Although nearly a thousand DCAs are currently in
   force, with potentially wide-ranging impacts on national and
   international security outcomes, DCAs have been largely ignored by
   scholars. Why have DCAs proliferated? I develop a theory that integrates
   cooperation theory with insights from social network analysis. Shifts in
   the global security environment since the 1980s have fueled demand for
   DCAs. States use DCAs to modernize their militaries, respond to shared
   security threats, and establish security umbrellas with like-minded
   states. Yet, demand alone cannot explain DCA proliferation; to
   cooperate, governments must also overcome dilemmas of mistrust and
   distributional conflicts. I show that network influences increase the
   supply of DCAs by providing governments with information about the
   trustworthiness of partners and the risk of asymmetric distributions of
   gains. DCAs become easier to sign as more states sign them. I identify
   two specific network influencespreferential attachment and triadic
   closureand show that these influences are largely responsible for the
   post-Cold War diffusion of DCAs. Novel empirical strategies further
   indicate that these influences derive from the proposed informational
   mechanism. States use the DCA ties of others to glean information about
   prospective defense partners, thus endogenously fueling further growth
   of the global DCA network.

AB We conceptualize immigrant incorporation as a categorically driven
   process and contrast the bright distinctions between first-generation
   immigrants and natives, with more blurry second-generation contrasts. We
   analyze linked employer-employee data of a sample of 5,097 employees in
   97 large German organizations and focus on first- and second-generation
   immigrants. We explore how generational status in the labor market and
   workplace contexts expands and contracts native-immigrant wage
   inequalities. We find a substantial average first-generation
   immigrant-native wage gap, which is not explained by individual human
   capital differences or most aspects of organizational context. In
   contrast, there is, on average, no second-generation wage gap, but there
   are substantial variations across workplaces. A series of results
   confirm predictions from relational inequality theory. For both first-
   and second-generation immigrants, working in a high-inequality workplace
   is associated with larger wage gaps. Second-generation immigrants
   perform better in workplaces where they have intersectional advantages
   over natives, and for first-generation immigrants collective bargaining
   protection narrows wage gaps with natives. Consistent with ethnic
   competition theory, in workplaces with very high shares of immigrant
   workers, the first-generation-native wage gap is larger. In contrast,
   increased contact between native Germans and second-generation immigrant
   coworkers reduces earnings gaps, but only up to a tipping point, after
   which competition processes reappear and earning gaps widen.

AB Gender-role attitudes capture individuals' degree of support for
   traditional divisions of paid and domestic work and have been linked to
   the production and reproduction of gender inequality in different social
   spheres. Previous research has established that life-course transitions
   are related to within-individual over-time change in gender-role
   attitudes. Most importantly, becoming a parent is associated with shifts
   toward more traditional viewpoints. Theories of attitude change suggest
   that the gender of children should influence the pattern of
   gender-attitude shifts that accompany parenthood, but very few studies
   have investigated this. We add to this literature using Australian panel
   data from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey
   (n = 29,918 observations) stretching over 15 years and fixed-effects
   panel regression models. We find that men's and women's gender-role
   attitudes become more traditional when they become parents, with
   evidence that this process is more pronounced among men, parents of
   daughters and, most of all, male parents of daughters.

AB "COIN," the counter-terrorism doctrine the United States used during the
   Iraq War, was in criminological terms overly reliant on militarized
   "incapacitationist" strategies. Based a on competing "societal
   reactions" or community-level labeling theory, we argue that COIN failed
   to anticipate but predictably produced state-based "legal cynicism" in
   Arab Sunni communities-increasing rather than decreasing politically
   defiant terrorist crimes. We test our hypotheses with nationally
   representative surveys and data on terrorist attacks collected before,
   during, and immediately after the 2007 Surge in US troops. The Surge
   increased perceptions of unnecessary US-led violence against Arab Sunni
   non-combatants, provoking cynical beliefs in Arab Sunni communities,
   creating local contexts in which terrorist attacks increased, and
   foreshadowing later advances by the Islamic State. Our findings show
   that oversimplified, incapacitation-oriented control tactics-in domestic
   policing, in COIN, or in the traditional warfare strategies that are
   replacing COIN-are likely to contribute to rather than reduce cycles of
   violence.

AB This 2017 British Journal of Sociology Lecture builds upon ideas
   developed in The Social Life of DNA: Race, Reparations, and
   Reconciliation after the Genome (Nelson 2016). I argue that one of the
   more significant developments of the postgenomic era is the circulation
   of DNA analysis outside of the life sciences, especially commercial
   applications such as direct-to-consumer genealogical testing. These
   tests are increasingly taken up in reconciliation projects' - endeavours
   in which DNA analysis is put to the use of repairing the past, including
   a recently launched attempt in the United States to locate descendants
   of enslaved persons sold by the Jesuit stewards of Georgetown College in
   order to bolster that institution's finances. With this reconciliation
   project, genetic genealogy has become a vehicle for a form of social
   repair, and most particularly, the reuniting of lost' kin. This use of
   genetic genealogy takes place against the backdrop of an expanding,
   national inquiry into ties between education and slavery. In the
   process, the legacy of racial slavery is rendered both contemporary and
   proximate, despite a colour-blind' racial project that aims to negate
   the significance of this history and its coeval development with US
   higher education. Elite educational institutions such as Georgetown that
   elect to excavate these histories are soon after faced with the choice
   of how to respond, on campus and beyond, to revelations of entanglements
   between edification and bondage. However imperfectly, colleges and
   universities are among the few institutional settings where the
   contested issue of structural racism (and remedies to it) may be aired.
   It is in these fraught debates that the exercise of institutional
   morality' can take shape; organizations engage in practices that
   articulate institutional values and are faced with a choice of symbolic
   and distributional responses.

AB The process of union formation and the context of childrearing have
   profoundly changed with the spread of cohabitation in the last few
   decades. It is only recently that some attention has been paid to the
   implications of these changes for family ties. This study considers,
   with reference to Italy, a specific relationship between individuals in
   couples and their family of origin - childcare by grandparents. The aim
   of the paper is twofold. First, we investigate whether children of
   cohabiting couples are cared for by their grandparents to a lower extent
   compared to children of married couples. Second, the current study
   examines whether potential differences decrease over time. The data used
   are from two rounds of cross-sectional and nationally representative
   survey conducted in Italy in 2003 and in 2009. Our results show that in
   2003 both in the provision and the intensity of grandparents' childcare,
   children of cohabiting parents were less likely to have their
   grandparents involved than children of married parents. However, the
   differences between marriages and cohabitations disappear in recent
   years.

AB Previous research has shown how institutional changes, such as
   educational expansion, have weakened parental influence on educational
   attainment. We extend this analysis to occupational attainment and put
   forth a parental compensation hypothesis: as the origin-education (OE)
   association weakens, parents act to compensate for this in order to
   maintain their influence on the child's occupational attainment. We
   should see this as a strengthened origin-destination association net of
   education (net OD). Further, we study whether these compensatory actions
   are triggered by changes in educational institutions and whether the
   institutional changes that reduce educational inequality are the same
   ones that prompt parental compensation. We have linked data from five
   waves of the European Social Survey (2002-10) with data on educational
   institutions matched to birth cohorts born 1941-80 in 25 countries. We
   find weakened OE and strengthened net OD associations, supporting our
   parental compensation hypothesis. Multilevel mixed effects regression
   analyses reveal that reforms lengthening compulsory education, and the
   increased access to and the attainment of higher education have had a
   positive influence on parental compensation. As a conclusion, a later
   school leaving age seems to secure increased parental influence on
   children's occupational attainment, while parents seem to have reacted
   to a lesser extent on the changes in higher education.

AB Drawing on an analysis of qualitative interview data from a study of
   formalized same-sex relationships (civil partnerships) this paper
   examines the enduring significance of marriage and family as social
   institutions. In doing so, it intervenes in current debates in the
   sociology of family and personal life about how such institutions are
   undermined by reflexivity or bolstered by convention. Against the
   backdrop of dominating sociological frames for understanding the links
   between the changing nature of marriage and family and same-sex
   relationship recognition, the paper analyses the diverse and overlapping
   ways (including the simple, relational, strategic, ambivalent and
   critical ways) in which same-sex partners reflexively constructed and
   engaged with marriage and family conventions. My analysis suggests that
   instead of viewing reflexivity and convention as mutually undermining,
   as some sociologists of family and personal life do, it is insightful to
   explore how diverse forms of reflexivity and convention interact in
   everyday life to reconfigure the social institutions of marriage and
   family, but do not undermine them as such. I argue the case for
   recognizing the ways in which reflexive convention', or reflexive
   investment in convention, contributes to the continuing significance of
   marriage and family as social institutions.

AB Non-confrontational engagement practices like ethical consumption are a
   popular form of everyday politics. Existing research into these
   practices offers positive evaluations (highlighting the value of
   everyday engagement in public life) and critical perspectives
   (questioning whether myriad small acts can address structural barriers
   to equity and sustainability). Meanwhile, less emphasis has been placed
   on understanding the underlying ideals and motivations for political
   action that seeks to avoid traditional politics. In order to advance
   such understanding, this case study uses participant observation and
   semi-structured interviews with 57 individuals whose daily paid or
   unpaid leadership roles shape eat-local initiatives. We find that in the
   local food realm, participants idealize pleasurable, convivial and
   pragmatic engagement and these ideals culminate in a particular form of
   everyday action we term small-p politics'. The paper offers a
   theoretically and empirically informed investigation of non-traditional
   political engagement in eat-local movements, concluding that it emerges
   from a site where: (a) cultural change is prioritized above contentious
   politics; (b) rejecting traditional political activity is linked with
   achieving tangible outcomes; and (c) consumers are deemed the ideal
   agents of change. Non-traditional politics play a prominent role in the
   landscape of contemporary civic engagement. This research advances our
   existing knowledge of such practices by providing a thick description of
   the political ideals that endorse consumption-based approaches to change
   in the realm of local food.

AB This article offers an interpretation of transitional justice policies -
   the efforts of post-conflict and post-dictatorship societies to address
   the legacy of past abuses - as a form of social control. While
   transitional justice is commonly conceptualized as responding to a core
   problem of impunity, this article argues that such formulation is too
   narrow and leads to lack of coherence in the analysis of the diverse
   array of transitional mechanisms, which include among others trials,
   truth commissions, reparations for victims and apologies. Building on
   the work of Stanley Cohen, the article contends that the core
   transitional problem is the denial of human rights violations, and
   consequently that the common purpose of all transitional justice
   mechanisms is to reclassify the past: redefining as deviant some acts
   and individuals which prior to the transition were considered normal'.
   The article identifies and analyses three themes in the application of a
   social control framework to transitional justice: (1) truth, memory and
   retroactive social control, pertains to the way truth-seeking
   transitional justice mechanisms reclassify past events by engaging in
   social control of and through memory; (2) censure, celebration and
   transitional social control refers to the reclassification of categories
   of individuals through expressions of both social disapproval and
   praise; and (3) civil society and social control from below concerns the
   role of social movements, organizations and groups as informal agents of
   social control during transitions. The concluding section recaps and
   briefly explores the concept of good moral panic' in the context of
   political transitions. While the concept of social control tends to have
   negative connotations for critical sociologists, this work suggests that
   efforts to categorize, punish and disapprove certain behaviours as
   deviant may not only be viewed as supporting a conservative status-quo,
   but also as promoting fledging human rights norms.

AB Recent trends suggest that young people in Britain are refraining from
   engaging in formal political processes. At the same time, they are
   increasingly expressing support for, and turning toward, a new and
   diverse range of non-institutionalized forms of political action in
   order to actualize their interests. Using Inglehart's ideas on
   postmaterialism, we consider whether this apparent rejection of
   mainstream politics in favour of less conventional - and sometimes
   radical - forms of political action is changing over time in Britain,
   reflecting fluctuating economic conditions witnessed over the last two
   decades. We do this by comparing results from surveys of British 18 year
   olds conducted in 2002 during an era of relative global prosperity, and
   then in 2011 at the height of the current global crisis. The findings
   suggest that British young postmaterialists are considerably more likely
   than materialists to participate in and support both institutionalized
   and non-institutionalized forms of political action.

AB What does it mean to attribute success to luck', but failure to personal
   deficiency? In 2015/16, more than 34 per cent of academic employees in
   UK higher education institutions were employed on temporary contracts,
   and the sector itself has undergone a substantial transformation in
   recent years in terms of expansion, measurement, and marketization.
   Based on two waves of interviews conducted with fixed-term academic
   employees at different career stages, the article explores the
   narrativization of success and failure amongst staff working at the
   sharp end' of the so-called neoliberal academy. Arguing that precarious
   employment situations precipitate the feeling of being out of control',
   the majority of the participants' narratives were characterized by a
   distinct lack of agency. The paper explores the recourse to notions of
   chance and the consolidation of luck' as an explanatory factor in
   accounting for why good things happen; however, in tandem with this
   inclination is the tendency to individualize failure when expectations
   have been thwarted. While accounts of fixed-term work are suffused with
   notions of chance and fortune, luck' remains an under-researched concept
   within sociology. The article thus concludes by considering what the
   analysis of luck' might offer for a fuller, politicized understanding of
   processes at work in the contemporary academy.

AB Debates on risk have largely assumed risk to be the outcome of
   calculative practices. There is a related assumption that risk objects
   come only in one form, and that the reason not everything can be
   transformed into a risk is because of the difficulties in calculating
   and creating universal quantitative comparisons. In this article,
   building on recent studies of preparedness that have broadened
   understandings of risk, we provide an analysis of how preparedness
   measures might themselves produce risk, in particular through risk's
   durable instantiation, or what we call concretization'. Our empirical
   focus is on how government agencies in two countries shifted their
   attention from the risk of nuclear attack during the Cold War to an all
   hazards approach to preparedness. Comparing the mid- to late-twentieth
   century histories of the UK and Switzerland, we show that both countries
   shifted from focusing from a single risk to plural risks. This shift
   cannot be explained by a change in prevailing calculative practices, or
   by the fact that the risks changed historically. Instead, it is driven
   by historically specific changes in how risks are produced and
   reproduced in relation to how materializations of risk operate over
   time.

AB There are growing debates about the appropriateness of offering money in
   exchange for the provision of bodily materials for clinical treatment
   and research. The bioethics literature and many practice guidelines have
   generally been opposed to such entanglement, depicting the use of money
   as contaminating, creating undue inducement, exploitation and
   commodification of the human body. However, two elements have been
   missing from these debates: (i) the perspectives of those people
   providing bodily materials when money is offered; and (ii) systematic
   empirical engagement with the notion of money' itself. This article
   seeks to fill those gaps in knowledge by providing detailed insights
   from a project investigating the views and experiences of women who
   volunteered to provide eggs for research in exchange for reduced fees
   for fertility treatment. Analysis of 29 semi-structured interviews
   reveals multiple ways in which volunteers reason through the involvement
   of money' in this domain and shows how their accounts diverge from
   pessimistic understandings of the role of monies in everyday life. When
   volunteers speak in detail about the monetary aspects of their
   participation they draw major, recurring, distinctions in five
   overlapping areas: their depiction of the monetized world of fertility
   treatment; their views of the different forms that money can take; a
   distancing of their actions from their understandings of how markets and
   commodities work; their location of the transactions within a particular
   clinic, and the ongoing importance of their eggs, post-transaction. This
   article: (i) responds to calls for concrete case studies to assist
   understandings of the inter-relationships of money and specific aspects
   of social life; (ii) adds to the sociology of money literature by
   providing empirical insights into how notions of money are deployed;
   (iii) presents much-needed perspectives from providers of bodily
   materials; and (iv) contributes to ongoing conversations between
   bioethics and sociology.

AB The article explores different ways to conceptualize the relationship
   between choice and culture. These two notions are often constructed as
   opposites: while sociologies of modernization (such as Giddens') portray
   a shift from cultural traditions to culturally disembedded choice,
   dispositional sociologies (such as Bourdieu's) uncover cultural
   determination as the hidden truth behind apparent choice. However,
   choice may be real and cultural simultaneously. Culture moulds choice
   not only by inculcating dispositions or shaping repertoires of
   alternatives, but also by offering culturally specific choice practices,
   ways of choosing embedded in meaning, normativity, and materiality; and
   by shaping attributions of choice in everyday life. By bringing together
   insights from rival schools, I portray an outline for a comparative
   cultural sociology of choice, and demonstrate its purchase while
   discussing the digitalization of choice; and cultural logics that shape
   choice attribution in ways opposing neoliberal trends.

AB How do institutions shape revisionist behavior in world politics?
   Applying a network-relational approach to revisionist states and
   challenges to institutional order, I conceive of institutions as
   networksas patterns of ongoing social transactions in which revisionists
   are embedded. Revisionist behavior is shaped by how a state is
   positioned within this existing network of institutions. A state's
   position significantly influences the material and cultural resources
   the state can deploy in pursuit of its aims, and thus the revisionist's
   strategy. Focusing on two measures of network positionaccess and
   brokerageI propose four ideal types of revisionists and their strategies
   in the international system: integrated revisionists, who are likely to
   pursue institutional engagement; bridging revisionists, who will seek
   rule-based revolution; isolated revisionists, who prefer to exit the
   institutional system; and rogue revisionists, who have few resources at
   hand, and thus ultimately must resort to hegemonic violence. I test
   these ideal types in four cases of revisionists and institutional
   orders: Russia in the 1820s; Prussia in the 1860s; the Soviet Union in
   the early Cold War; and Japan in the 1920s and 1930s.

AB Existing theories predict that the rise of China will trigger a
   hegemonic transition and the current debate centers on whether or not
   the transition will be violent or peaceful. This debate largely
   sidesteps two questions that are central to understanding the future of
   international order: how strong is the current Western hegemonic order
   and what is the likelihood that China can or will lead a successful
   counterhegemonic challenge? We argue that the future of international
   order is shaped not only by material power but also by the distribution
   of identity across the great powers. We develop a constructivist account
   of hegemonic transition and stability that theorizes the role of the
   distribution of identity in international order. In our account,
   hegemonic orders depend on a legitimating ideology that must be
   consistent with the distribution of identity at the level of both elites
   and masses. We map the distribution of identity across nine great powers
   and assess how this distribution supports the current Western neoliberal
   democratic hegemony. We conclude that China is unlikely to become the
   hegemon in the near term.

   game-theoretic network model to show why the structure of trusted
   communication networks among civilians where rebel groups formwhich
   carry credible rumors about the rebelscan influence whether incipient
   rebels become viable. We argue further that in rural Sub-Saharan Africa,
   kinship network structures favorable to nascent rebels often underlie
   ethnically homogeneous localities, but not heterogeneous ones. In doing
   so, we advance a new explanation for why ethnicity influences conflict
   onset, and show why ethnic grievances may not be a necessary condition

   new evidence from Uganda that provides a rare window into rebel group

AB Migration is likely to be a key factor linking climate change and
   conflict. However, our understanding of the factors behind and
   consequences of migration is surprisingly limited. We take this
   shortcoming as a motivation for our research and study the relationship
   between environmental migration and conflict at the micro level. In
   particular, we focus on environmental migrants' conflict perceptions. We
   contend that variation in migrants' conflict perception can be explained
   by the type of environmental event people experienced in their former
   home, whether gradual, and long-term or sudden-onset, short-term
   environmental changes. We develop this argument before quantitatively
   analyzing newly collected micro-level data on intra-state migration from
   five developing countries. The results emphasize that migrants who
   experienced gradual, long-term environmental events in their former
   homes are more likely to perceive conflict in their new location than
   those having experienced sudden, short-term environmental events. These
   findings are in line with our theoretical argument that environmental
   migrants who suffer from environmentally induced grievances are
   ultimately more likely to perceive conflict and challenges in their new
   locations.

   democratic countries prone to financial crises. Democracy is
   characterized by constraints on executive authority, accountability
   through free and fair elections, protections for civil liberties, and
   large winning coalitions. These characteristics bring important
   benefits, but they can also have unintended consequences that increase
   the likelihood of financial instability and crises. Using data covering
   the past two centuries, I demonstrate a strong relationship between
   democracy and financial crisis onset: on average, democracies are about
   twice as likely to experience a crisis as autocracies. This is an
   empirical regularity that is robust across a wide range of model
   specifications and time periods.

   We use original survey data from a poll fielded just one day before the
   2015 Greek bailout referenduma referendum in which the stakes for other
   countries were particularly highto investigate how expectations about
   the likely foreign response to a noncooperative referendum outcome
   influence voting behavior and to what extent foreign policymakers can
   influence those expectations. Our analysis of the Greek referendum shows
   that such expectations had a powerful effect on voting behavior: voters
   expecting that a noncooperative referendum outcome would force Greece to
   leave the eurozone were substantially more likely to vote cooperatively
   than those believing that it would result in renewed negotiations with
   the country's creditors. Leveraging the bank closure that took place
   right before the vote, we also show that costly signals by foreign
   actors made voters more pessimistic about the consequences of a
   noncooperative vote and substantially increased the share of cooperative
   votes.

AB Despite facing significant uncertainty about their lifespans and health
   care costs, most retirees do not buy annuities or long-term care
   insurance. In this paper, I find that retirees' saving and insurance
   choices are highly inconsistent with standard life-cycle models in which
   people care only about their own consumption but match well models in
   which bequests are luxury goods. Bequest motives tend to reduce the
   value of insurance by reducing the opportunity cost of precautionary
   saving. The results suggest that bequest motives significantly increase
   saving and significantly decrease purchases of long-term care insurance
   and annuities.

AB Using a set of user-generated data, we examine patterns in the careers
   of professional chefs. We argue that this is one of many cases in which
   careers must be understood as shaped by dual structures-the typical
   occupational structure within a firm, and the organization of firms in a
   larger field. We then demonstrate how career trajectories may be
   formalized as movement through a two-dimensional space defined by status
   in these structures. Building on previous ethnographic work finding that
   chefs understand the logic of their careers as involving repeated
   trade-offs between their occupational status (their rank within the
   kitchen) and organizational status (the status of the restaurant at
   which they work), we attempt to determine how different trajectories are
   associated with different outcomes. We find that, despite the somewhat
   random nature of entrance into the culinary profession, future top-tier
   chefs disproportionately begin their careers at high-status restaurants.
   Beyond their auspicious beginnings, these top-chefs-to-be also commonly
   devote their early careers to maximizing organizational status, forgoing
   promotions to higher kitchen ranks in favor of low-level jobs at more
   prestigious restaurants. By comparison, chefs destined to run
   lower-status restaurants tend to spend their early careers prioritizing
   rapid advancement within the kitchen, only pursuing jobs at more
   prestigious restaurants much later in their careers, with limited
   success.

AB In this article, we investigate the redistributive outcomes of the
   Finnish pension system. We hypothesize that a pension system does not
   straightforwardly diminish, maintain, or increase income differences
   after retirement, but it can have different outcomes for different
   groups. Our focus is on differences in changes in income between groups
   that vary in their timing and type of retirement. We make use of
   longitudinal register-based data from the Finnish Centre for Pensions
   and analyze income and retirement trajectories of Finnish employees born
   in 1948 from the age of 57 to 66 (N = 44,449). Our aim is to find out in
   what way trajectories of income from earnings and pensions are related
   to different types of retirement trajectories, while controlling for
   gender, sector of employment, and length of working life. Eight distinct
   retirement trajectories are identified using sequence analysis. The
   results of our multilevel regression models indicate that the pension
   system sustains inequalities related to gender and employment sector.
   Early old-age retirement and part-time retirement are associated with
   higher earnings and more generous pension entitlements, indicating
   cumulative advantage. Lower earnings are associated with higher risk of
   early exit through unemployment and disability pensions, while the
   pension system guarantees a minimum income level in retirement,
   resulting in status leveling. Those who retire later are relatively well
   off in work, but worse off in retirement, suggesting a status-leveling
   outcome. By disentangling these outcomes of the pension system, it is
   possible to learn social policy lessons for other national institutional
   contexts as well.

AB The impact of participation in extracurricular activities on academic
   success has long been studied in the social sciences. This article aims
   at improving the measurement and understanding of this impact. Based on
   panel data regression models applied to a panel of French middle school
   students, it first provides a robust estimation of the impact of
   extracurricular activities on school outcomes (marks in French and
   Mathematics) and on a set of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. It
   finds a positive and significant impact on marks in French and
   Mathematics and scores on non-cognitive skills tests. No impact is found
   on cognitive skills. The article then investigates the underlying
   mechanisms of this impact. Its findings do not reinforce the transfer
   paradigm, according to which extracurricular activities provide students
   who participate in them with skills that they can reinvest in school
   life. Neither does it support the notion that such an impact may
   primarily be the result of students' greater connivance with the
   cultural standards of teachers. Instead, it seems likely that what is
   mainly at stake in participation in extracurricular activities is
   families' unequal capacity for extending the time of school supervision
   in their children's free time. Therefore, insofar as the varying
   participation in these activities is strongly correlated to differences
   in students' social and cultural background, participation in
   extracurricular activities would in itself contribute to reinforcing
   social inequalities in school achievement.

AB Leisure time activity is often positioned as a key factor in child
   development, yet we know relatively little about the causal significance
   of various specific activities or the magnitude of their effects. Here,
   we couple individual fixed effects and instrumental variable approaches
   in trying to determine whether specific forms of leisure contribute to
   gains in test performance over time. We merge a restricted access
   version of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) Child Development
   Supplement (CDS), longitudinally collected from 1997 to 2007, with a
   database of over three million county-day observations of sunlight. We
   use this proxy for weather to instrument for the variation in physical,
   outdoor, sedentary, and screen-time behaviors based on CDS time diaries.
   We find evidence that physical and outdoor activity positively influence
   math performance, while sedentary behavior and screen time exhibit the
   opposite effect. Moreover, the effect sizes range from a fifth to more
   than half a standard deviation per additional daily hour of activity,
   rendering them meaningful in a real-world sense. Our stratified results
   indicate that children from less educated mothers and girls seem to be
   most sensitive to the effects of active and passive forms of leisure. We
   conclude with a descriptive examination of the trend lines between our
   data and the new 2014 CDS cohort, providing relevant contemporary
   context for our findings.

AB Individuals with disabilities experience lower education levels, lower
   employment rates, fewer household resources, and poorer health than
   people without disabilities. Yet, despite comprising more than
   one-eighth of the US population, people with disabilities are seldom
   integrated into sociological studies of inequality. This study uses time
   use as a lens through which to understand one type of inequality between
   working-aged people with and without disabilities: participation in
   daily activities. It also tests whether social disparities (as suggested
   by the social model of disability) or health disparities (as suggested
   by the medical model of disability) explain a larger percentage of
   participation differences. I first consider if disability predicts daily
   time in market work, nonmarket work, tertiary (health-related)
   activities, and leisure-net of health and sociodemographic
   characteristics. Next, I utilize Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to assess
   the relative contribution of these characteristics in explaining time
   differences. Results from the American Time Use Survey indicate that
   adults with disabilities spend less time than adults without
   disabilities in market work and more time in tertiary activities and
   leisure. There is no difference in nonmarket time. Health accounts for
   the largest percentage of the explained component of tertiary time
   differences, but depending on the choice of predictors, sociodemographic
   characteristics account for as much-or more-of the explained component
   of differences in market and leisure time. Results indicate the
   importance of disentangling disability from health in sociological
   studies of inequality. They also support a hybrid disability model in
   suggesting that both health and sociodemographic characteristics
   determine how disability shapes daily life.

AB It is well established that women have surpassed men in educational
   attainment. The potential effect of educational institutional structures
   on the "rise of women" has largely been overlooked. In particular, the
   age of first selection into distinct educational tracks seems important,
   as the female-favorable gap in educational performance has been shown to
   widen during the high school years. Using microdata from the European
   Social Survey and data on tracking age reforms for 21 European countries
   from 1929 to 2000, we find that reforms promoting later tracking have
   particularly benefited girls' years of education, net of other
   influential factors (gender-ideological climate and demand on the labor
   market). This finding shows that the rise of women is not homogeneous
   across institutional contexts: some educational systems are more
   supportive of the enhancement of women's education than others.

AB Prior studies of gender and family attitudes indicate that the arrival
   of a child, a major life-course event, may contribute to shifts in these
   attitudes. Virtually no research, however, examines attitudinal changes
   accompanying parenthood in non-Western contexts, where childrearing
   experiences are likely to differ. Using longitudinal data and
   fixed-effects models, we investigate how having a child, as well as
   having a daughter versus a son, is associated with changes in attitudes
   toward gender and family issues in Japan, a country known for its highly
   gendered distribution of child-related responsibilities within families.
   Contrary to previous findings that parenthood has a "traditionalizing"
   effect in the United States and other Western societies, we find that
   women in Japan generally become less supportive of traditional gender
   roles as their number of children increases. They also become more
   approving of divorce after having a daughter. Conversely, Japanese men
   experience fewer changes, although they do become less positive about
   the value of jobs for women with additional children and more negative
   about a child's impact on the couple after adding a son. We argue that
   the relatively high tolerance of dissonance between attitudes and
   behaviors in East Asian cultures weakens the psychological motivation
   for the Japanese to align their views with their increasingly gendered
   behaviors upon entering parenthood. At the same time, women's experience
   with greater gender inequality within the household provides them with
   more incentives to be critical of gendered practices and institutions,
   resulting in less traditional attitudes as they have more children.

AB Social disorganization theory is one of the most widely tested theories
   in criminology, yet few studies consider the temporal and spatial
   dynamics of neighborhood composition, neighborhood informal social
   control, and crime. To better understand these relationships, we use
   census data, police data, and three survey waves of data from a unique
   longitudinal dataset with over 4,000 respondents living across 148
   neighborhoods in an Australian city undergoing rapid population growth.
   We employ cross-lagged reciprocal feedback models to test the central
   tenets of social disorganization theory and its contemporary advances
   for three crime types: violent crime, property crime, and drug crime.
   Further, we examine the reciprocal relationship between neighborhood
   composition, three components of informal social control (neighborhood
   social ties, expectations for informal social control, and the exercise
   of informal social control), and crime and whether socio-demographic
   changes in nearby neighborhoods shape these relationships over time. We
   find that changes in the socio-demographic composition in both focal and
   nearby areas influence neighborhood informal social control; however, in
   contrast to cross-sectional studies of social disorganization theory,
   our results reveal little support that neighborhood informal social
   control significantly decreases crime over time.

AB Since the late 1990s, a growing body of literature has researched the
   cross-national diffusion of policies that affect lesbian, gay, bisexual,
   and transgender (LGBT) communities. Studies stemming from world society
   consider how state ties to newly emergent global norms regarding the
   treatment of LGBT communities are a driver of this process. A
   shortcoming of these studies, however, is that they do not adequately
   consider which type of ties to global norms are most meaningful for
   policy adoption. Considering the ever-increasing notion that LGBT rights
   are human rights, this study contrasts the role of human rights
   international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and LGBT INGOs on
   LGBT policy diffusion between 1991 and 2015. While previous studies
   assume a global norm exists, focus on a narrow band of policies, or
   restrict analyses to key geographic areas, this study develops a new
   measure of global LGBT norms and offers a comprehensive LGBT Policy
   Index for a global sample of 156 countries. Through pooled
   cross-sectional time series with fixed effects, the results demonstrate
   that human rights INGOs are not adequate vehicles for pressuring
   national adoption of LGBT policies. Instead, targeted advocacy efforts,
   embodied through LGBT INGOs, are required in order for policy adoption
   to transpire.

AB Groups often designate a leader to enforce their members' contributions
   to collective efforts. Prior work has demonstrated that allowing groups
   to democratically elect a leader is particularly effective at enhancing
   cooperation once the elected leader obtains the position. Here I go
   further by considering whether people vie to win elected leadership
   positions, contributing more to collective efforts even before the
   leader is elected. Specifically, I demonstrate that groups typically
   elect their more cooperative members to leadership. Individual members
   anticipate this and compete for leadership by increasing their
   contributions to collective efforts when they expect leaders will be
   elected by voters with knowledge of candidates' prior behaviors,
   compared to when cooperative behaviors are visible, but leaders will be
   appointed (Study 1), or when leaders will be elected, but not on the
   basis of candidates' cooperative behaviors (Study 2). Though prior work
   has centered on the beneficial effects of elected leadership after an
   election is held, I demonstrate a novel mechanism by which elections
   promote cooperation: before the election is held, via competition for
   leadership. More generally, the results suggest that the leader
   selection process is a critical factor in determining the success of
   groups facing collective action problems.

AB This research uses comparative survey data to examine the effects of
   labor union membership on individual political participation. We argue
   that national political institutions-specifically, democracy and
   corporatism-shape the ways that unions mobilize their members to engage
   in the political sphere. Democratic regimes provide structural
   opportunities and cultural repertoires that lead unions to focus on
   member mobilization, especially via contentious politics and political
   parties. Corporatism, which directly links unions to state structures,
   undercuts the logics and incentives for union mobilization. We draw upon
   historical cases of Germany, the United States, Chile, and Egypt to
   illustrate how democracy and corporatism shape unions' mobilization
   efforts. Multilevel models of World Values Survey data from roughly 60
   countries find that union members participate more than non-members
   across a range of electoral and extra-institutional political acts, such
   as demonstrating, occupying buildings, signing petitions, party work,
   and so forth. In democratic societies, such effects are stronger and
   participation shifts toward parties and contentious politics. In less
   democratic societies, union members are particularly likely to work with
   and through other political organizations. Corporatist arrangements
   generally dampen the political activities of union members.

AB Why do ethnic and racialized minorities have lower trust? While previous

   origins of ethnic groups, this paper draws attention to the ethnic
   majority-minority relationship. We argue that ethnic differences in
   trust are a function of the power dynamics underlying this relationship
   and that these dynamics are particularly salient in democratic political
   systems. To test this argument, we develop new measures of ethnic
   majority-minority status, which for the first time allows for global
   cross-national comparison of heterogeneous ethnic groups at the micro
   level. Using the World Values Survey, we test the majority-minority
   argument, showing that, while democracy increases generalized trust
   across the board, it also leads to a gap in trust that favors the
   majority group. This gap remains even after the inclusion of controls
   for country differences in factors such as ethnic diversity and GDP.

AB Sociologists interested in the effects of genes on complex social
   outcomes claim environmental conditions structure when and how genes
   matter, but they have only studied environmental moderation of genetic
   effects on single traits at a time (gene-by-environment interactions).
   In this article, we propose that the social environment can also
   transform the genetic link between two traits. Taking the relationship
   between educational attainment and smoking as an exemplary case, we use
   genome-wide methods to examine whether genetic variants linked to
   education are also linked to smoking, and whether the strength of this
   relationship varies across birth cohorts. Results suggest that the
   genetic relationship between education and smoking is stronger among
   U.S. adults born between 1974 and 1983 than among those born between
   1920 and 1959. These results are supported by replication in additional
   data from the United Kingdom. Environmental conditions that differ
   across birth cohorts may result in the bundling of genetic effects on
   multiple outcomes, as anticipated by classic cohort theory. We introduce
   genetic correlation-by-environment interaction [(rG)xE] as a
   sociologically-informed model that will become especially useful as data
   for more well-powered analyses become available.

AB Despite numerous legal interventions intended to mitigate racial
   discrimination in the United States, racial inequality persists in
   virtually every domain that matters for human well-being. To better
   understand the processes enabling this durable inequality, I undertake a
   case study of the housing market-a domain centrally linked to
   persistent, systemic disparity. I examine how racial stereotypes
   permeate the distinct but serially linked stages of the housing exchange
   process; the conditions under which stereotypes are deployed in each
   stage; and how such dynamics accumulate to affect ultimate processes of
   exclusion and inclusion. Drawing on one year of ethnographic fieldwork
   and more than 100 in-depth interviews in the Houston housing market, my
   findings demonstrate that widely shared, hierarchical stereotypes about
   race, supported by conditions such as network-necessitated
   rapport-building and discretion, compound discrimination across discrete
   stages of housing exchange. I argue that as this accumulation occurs,
   inequality between minorities and minority neighborhoods and whites and
   white neighborhoods is rendered durable.

AB We examine immigrants' earnings trajectories and measure the extent and
   speed with which they are able to reduce the earnings gap with natives,
   using a dataset that links respondents of the Survey of Income and
   Program Participation (SIPP) to their longitudinal earnings obtained
   from individual tax records. Our analysis addresses key debates
   regarding ethnoracial and cohort differences in immigrants' earnings
   trajectories. First, we find a racially differentiated pattern of
   earnings assimilation: black and Hispanic immigrants are less able to
   catch up with native whites' earnings compared to white and Asian
   immigrants, but they are almost able to reach earnings parity with
   natives of their same race and ethnicity. Second, we find no evidence of
   a declining quality of immigrant cohorts even after controlling for
   their ethnoracial composition and human capital. Immigrants arriving
   since 1994 actually experience similar or slightly higher earnings
   growth compared to immigrants from earlier eras. We identify a pattern
   of accelerated assimilation in which more educated immigrants experience
   much of their earnings growth during the first years after arriving.

AB This study reconsiders the phenomenon that married men earn more money
   than unmarried men, a key result of the research on marriage benefits.
   Many earlier studies have found such a male marital wage premium. Recent
   studies using panel data for the United States conclude that part of
   this premium is due to selection of high earners into marriage.
   Nevertheless, a substantial effect of marriage seems to remain. The
   current study investigates whether the remaining premium is really a
   causal effect. Using conventional fixed-effects models, previous studies
   statistically controlled for selection based on wage levels only. We
   suggest a more general fixed-effects model that allows for higher wage
   growth of to-be-married men. The empirical test draws on panel data from
   the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979 to 2012). We replicate
   the main finding of the literature: a wage premium remains after
   controlling for selection on individual wage levels. However, the
   remaining effect is not causal. The results show that married men earn
   more because selection into marriage operates not only on wage levels
   but also on wage growth. Hence, men on a steep career track are
   especially likely to marry. We conclude that arguments postulating a
   wage premium for married men should be discarded.

AB What is the worth of a college degree when higher education expands? The
   relative education hypothesis posits that when college degrees are rare,
   individuals with more education have less competition to enter
   highly-skilled occupations. When college degrees are more common, there
   may not be enough highly-skilled jobs to go around; some
   college-educated workers lose out to others and are pushed into
   less-skilled jobs. Using new measurements of occupation-level verbal,
   quantitative, and analytic skills, this study tests the changing effect
   of education on skill utilization across 70 years of birth cohorts from
   1971 to 2010, net of all other age, period, and cohort trends.
   Higher-education expansion erodes the value of a college degree, and
   college-educated workers are at greater risk for underemployment in less
   cognitively demanding occupations. This raises questions about the
   sources of rising income inequality, skill utilization across the
   working life course, occupational sex segregation, and how returns to
   education have changed across different life domains.

AB Mass media has long been discussed as an essential determinant of the
   threat perceptions leading to anti-immigration attitudes. The field of
   empirical research on such media effects is still comparatively young,
   however, and lacks studies examining precise measures of the media
   environment an individual is likely to be actually exposed to. We employ
   a nuanced research design which analyses individual differences in the
   yearly levels of both media salience and attitudes in panel data of
   25,000 persons, who were at least interviewed twice, and a time span
   over 15 years, from 2001 to 2015. We find a substantive and stable
   positive effect: comparing periods of vivid discussions with times where
   the issue was hardly discussed in the German media results in an
   increase in the predicted probability of being very concerned by about
   13 percentage points. Deeper investigations reveal that the media effect
   is most potent for individuals living in areas with lower share of
   ethnic minorities and for those with lower education or conservative
   ideology, stressing the importance of individual receptiveness. In sum,
   our findings strengthen the line of reasoning stressing the importance
   of discursive influences on public opinion and cast doubt on the
   argument that threat perceptions stem primarily from the size of ethnic
   out-groups.

AB We show that the neighborhoods in which children grow up shape their
   earnings, college attendance rates, and fertility and marriage patterns
   by studying more than 7 million families who move across commuting zones
   and counties in the United States. Exploiting variation in the age of
   children when families move, we find that neighborhoods have significant
   childhood exposure effects: the outcomes of children whose families move
   to a better neighborhood-as measured by the outcomes of children already
   living there-improve linearly in proportion to the amount of time they
   spend growing up in that area, at a rate of approximately 4% per year of
   exposure. We distinguish the causal effects of neighborhoods from
   confounding factors by comparing the outcomes of siblings within
   families, studying moves triggered by displacement shocks, and
   exploiting sharp variation in predicted place effects across birth
   cohorts, genders, and quantiles to implement overidentification tests.
   The findings show that neighborhoods affect intergenerational mobility
   primarily through childhood exposure, helping reconcile conflicting
   results in the prior literature.

   the central tendency of worker flows, which is closely related to the
   ranking of firms revealed by workers' choices. There is evidence for
   compensating differentials when workers systematically move to
   lower-paying firms in a way that cannot be accounted for by layoffs or

   Through a narrative analysis, we identify historical policy changes

   on those regulatory events that we classify as unrelated to short-run
   cyclical or credit market shocks, we find that an increase in mortgage
   purchases by the agencies boosts mortgage lending, in particular
   refinancing, and lowers mortgage rates. Agency purchases also influence

   expand homeownership. We compare these effects to those of conventional

   surplus as a function of quantities (rather than prices), we present
   simple formulas for optimal prices and show that Cournot equilibrium
   exists and corresponds to a Ramsey optimum. We then discuss a tractable
   class of preferences that involve a generalized form of homotheticity.
   Profit-maximizing quantities are proportional to efficient quantities.
   We discuss optimal monopoly regulation when the firm has private
   information about its cost vector and find situations in which optimal
   regulation leaves relative price decisions to the firm.

AB Experimental economists currently lack a convention for how to pay
   subjects in experiments with multiple tasks. We provide a theoretical
   framework for analyzing this question. Assuming statewise monotonicity
   and nothing else, we prove that paying for one randomly chosen
   problem-the random problem selection mechanism-is essentially the only
   incentive compatible mechanism. Paying for every period is similarly
   justified when we assume only a "no complementarities at the top"
   condition. To help experimenters decide which is appropriate for their
   particular experiment, we discuss empirical tests of these two
   assumptions.

AB No longer is it acceptable to rationalize racial hierarchy in explicit
   terms. Today's racism substitutes these views for seemingly nonracial
   ones that diminish structural discrimination and "blame the victim."
   Though recent studies uncover the subtle, implicit, and covert discourse
   of colorblindness, claims of ideological progression have been offered
   without empirical verification. Examining debate surrounding the
   three-fifths clause of the U.S. Constitution, I complete a historical
   ethnographic content analysis that transplants colorblind ideology into
   historical soil where some presume it does not belong. The data derive
   from A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation, which is an archival
   collection held by the Library of Congress. The data set consists of
   1,493 pages of congressional record. My findings reveal how
   colorblindness captured in phrases like "I'm not racist, but ...." have
   historical parallels in "I'm principled against slavery, but ..." This
   observation merits more theoretical attention because it shows how the
   very ideology some describe as novel today persisted in a previous era.
   In other words, colorblindness was not created out of whole cloth in
   post-1960s America.

   included five elements-distancing themselves from sexual minorities who
   conformed to stereotypes about the group, overlooking career sacrifices
   they had already made, anticipating that their future careers would be
   sexuality free, and maintaining a general sense of hope and optimism.
   Some respondents even anticipated positive career consequences, pointing
   to three advantages of sexual minority status, including a strong career
   motivation, unique skills and abilities, and favorable treatments from
   employers. We interpret these results by conceptualizing their career
   plans as a part of their life narratives and discuss the implications
   for the sexual minority population and for society.

AB In this article, I propose a framework for analyzing context-specific
   relationships between neoliberal restructuring and simultaneous efforts
   to reorganize racial and colonial domination. To do so, I explore the
   articulation between colonization and neoliberalization in the West Bank
   with a focus on the Bethlehem region. Drawing on qualitative interviews
   and ethnographic research, the article begins by examining the
   territorial fragmentation of the Bethlehem region into a series of
   isolated Palestinian enclosures. These neoliberal enclosures attempt to
   contain a colonized population that has become increasingly disposable
   with the restructuring of Israel's economy. As sites of concentrated
   inequality and intense marginalization, however, they offer only a
   precarious form of containment. The article then turns to the
   Palestinian villages, which have become front lines of the struggle over
   colonization in the West Bank. In the hills west of Bethlehem,
   Palestinian villagers confront colonial violence by Israeli settlers and
   the state. They also confront a crisis of unemployment and rapid
   urbanization due to neoliberal restructuring. These dynamics have
   combined to create an indirect form of displacement and a market-based
   strategy of colonization. Overall, therefore, Palestinians in the West
   Bank today confront a unique form of neoliberal colonization.

AB In the United States, more than 1 in 5 households with children are
   unable to access and provide adequate food for a healthy, active
   lifestyle. We argue that the contribution of local context for food
   insecurity risk has largely been overlooked in favor of focusing on
   individual family characteristics, and that this is problematic given
   that mitigating food insecurity may be a communal process. We examine
   the relevance of neighborhood contributors to food insecurity among
   children, utilizing geocoded and nationally-representative data from the
   ECLS-K: 2010-2011 kindergarten cohort. We find little evidence that
   neighborhood socioeconomic, food retail, or social services
   characteristics directly impact food insecurity risk. However, our
   results reveal that family and neighborhood socioeconomic
   characteristics combine to impact food insecurity in ways consistent
   with a disadvantage paradox. As neighborhood concentrated disadvantage
   increases, higher-SES families' risk of food insecurity increases, but
   lower-SES families' risk decreases. This paradox is not explained by a
   higher concentration of social service organizations in more
   disadvantaged neighborhoods, and we theorize that impoverished families
   with children may share information and resources in disadvantaged
   communities to avoid food insecurity.

   suffering," a participant-derived concept describing a novel modality of
   suffering. Genetic suffering is detailed in relation to four themes: 1)

   and genetic testing, 3) Ambiguity and genetic onset, and 4) Fatalism and
   genetic prognosis. After describing the intersections between the

   making processes that affect the use of condoms in adult films. Drawing
   on in-depth interviews with people in the adult film industry, I argue
   that those within the gay and straight adult film industries utilize
   condoms and HIV testing as strategic actions motivated by two separate
   institutional logics. Within the straight industry, I find that a logic
   of profit maximization motivates HIV testing with the effect of
   identifying and quarantining HIV positive performers. Those within the
   straight industry then strategically justify non-condom use stating
   condoms are painful and condom use is an issue of performer's choice.
   Within the gay adult film industry, I find that a logic of civil rights
   and solidarity motivates condom use by implicitly avoiding identifying
   and stigmatizing HIV positive performers through mandated HIV tests.
   Ironically, performers in the gay adult film industry also strategically
   use condoms to manage their reputations and stigma by signaling to
   consumers that they are not HIV positive. In sum, these findings
   highlight the important ways people strategically rationalize and
   justify organizational health policies and practices while motivated by
   shared cultural schemas.

AB Over the past 40 years, the scale of environmental problems has
   increased to monumental proportions, while environmental politics has
   shrunk to the micro level. Injunctions for each individual to "do their
   part" by modifying their lifestyle and consumption habits multiplied,
   while collective action and policies targeting environmental degradation
   at the point of production diminished. This "individualization" of
   environmental politics has been described and critiqued, but no
   convincing explanation for it presented. In this article, I explore its
   origins through an historical case study of the paradigmatic example of
   individualized environmentalism: recycling. I wield original empirical
   material to both challenge and sharpen prevailing accounts of
   recycling's institutionalization and to theorize the broader trend of
   individualization. Drawing on Antonio Gramsci's theory of hegemony, I
   advance the thesis that the individualization of environmental politics
   is due to their skillful management by key corporate interests. In order
   to deter costly legislation, producers have created and implemented
   solutions that appeal to environmentalists' concerns, yet in a way that
   defines individual consumers, not producers, as the source of
   environmental degradation. The lack of a mass environmental movement
   enabled producers to organize these solutions on the fertile grounds of
   civil society.

   century in France. We use pooled data from the French Labour Force
   surveys for the period 1982-2014 and undertake an analysis of 11 birth
   cohorts born between 1918 and 1984. We demonstrate that social
   background inequality in terms of access to higher education has
   diminished across cohorts, even within the highest and most selective
   educational levels, such as the grandes ecoles. However, we also
   document, as Torche did in the United States, the existence in France of

   across levels of education. Thus, contrary to previous assertions made
   by Hout, the influence of social background on social destination does
   not necessarily decline linearly with educational level. Altogether,
   these findings question the greater meritocratic nature of the labour
   market among the highly educated and call for more research to be
   undertaken on the influence of non-meritocratic assets related to social

   development.

   grandparents' and aunts and uncles' resources in Finland and the United
   States using longitudinal panel data (Finnish Census Panel and the Panel
   Study for Income Dynamics (PSID)). Our results suggest that aunts and
   uncles' resources contribute more than those of grandparents. Moreover,
   we find evidence for extended family compensation in completing upper
   secondary education and the avoidance of low pay in both countries. The
   results suggest that compensation by aunts and uncles takes place for
   the avoidance of marginalization and is particularly likely when both
   parents and grandparents have low resources.

AB Until recently, research on intergenerational processes of social
   mobility has focused on two generational processes and paid little
   attention to the role of the grand-parental generation. An increasing
   number of studies have started to address this shortfall, but they
   report inconsistent findings. This may be due to design and measurement
   differences across studies and to substantive heterogeneity in the
   association. We use data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and
   Retirement in Europe (SHARE) to explore these two issues. First, as we
   have information on all four grandparents, and both parents, we were
   able to evaluate the different ways to model grand-parental
   associations. We found that including information on both grandfathers
   provided the best fit, once controlling for parental education. Second,
   we investigated the moderating effects of parental education, family
   size, and the grandparents' being alive during the grandchild's early
   life and school years. Having higher educated grandfathers is associated
   with higher educational outcomes for grandchildren, net of parental
   education and wealth. Moreover, having two highly educated grandfathers
   shows a stronger association than just one. We found no evidence for the
   interactions we tested making it unclear what the mechanisms underlying
   the association are. Future work to identify the mechanisms may be able
   to shed light on the actual role that grandparents play.

   ethnicity, this study suggests that ethnic discrimination is strongly
   moderated by gender: minority males are consistently subject to a much
   larger degree of discrimination than minority females across different
   types of occupations. Second, this study addresses a key critique of
   previous correspondence experiments by examining the potential
   confounding effect of socio-economic status related to the names used to
   represent distinct ethnic groups. The results support the notion that
   differences in callbacks are caused exclusively by the ethnic traits.

AB Analysing mobility decisions has been on the research agenda of various
   disciplines for many years, resulting in a diversity of conceptual and
   statistical approaches. However, previous empirical studies typically
   model regional mobility from an actor-centred perspective which lacks to
   take the contextual embeddedness of individuals in regions and
   partnerships into account. Against this background, this study proposes
   a multilevel dyadic approach with which different aspects of mobility
   decisions can be incorporated in a joint modelling framework.
   Specifically, this approach allows to specify actor, partner, and
   contextual effects in a dyadic model structure which covers two stages
   of the migration process. Linking the intentional decision stage and
   actual moving behaviour enables to study indirect effects of individual
   characteristics on regional mobility through actor-specific mobility
   dispositions. Formally, the model is implemented using multilevel probit
   structural equation models and applied to data on labour market-related
   mobility from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP and SOEP
   Geocodes). The results support both the dyadic and the multilevel
   component of the proposed model, indicating significant partner and
   contextual effects in the decision-making process of couples.

   representative descriptive information on the types and degrees of
   family complexity that contemporary adult generations in The Netherlands
   (adults born between 1971 and 1991) have experienced when they were
   growing up. Unique features of the OKiN data are (i) the oversample of
   persons who grew up with separated and/or widowed parents, and persons
   who grew up with a step-parent; (ii) the double multi-actor design (i.e.
   primary respondents (anchors) report about multiple parent figures and
   parent figures (alters) report about multiple children); and (iii) the
   systematic probing of relations to and characteristics of all parent
   figures in the respondent's life. The brief provides the first

   generous benefits. We show that advantageous selection into MA cannot

AB How do investors enter and navigate markets where there is a general
   lack of access to information and where the law is open to
   interpretation? Drawing on interview data with 100 research subjects in
   Vietnam's real estate market, this article makes contributions to the
   literatures of economic sociology and development. First, looking at a
   diverse set of local, regional, and global investors, I theorize how
   market actors pursue different strategies to manage risky investments
   based on their proximity to state officials. Investors' proximity
   depends on four processes: legal/regulatory, social ties, cultural
   matching, and stage of investment. Second, I highlight how multiple
   state-market relations can coexist within the same state. Investors'
   varying levels of proximity to government officials shape their
   relationship with the state as one of patronage (predatory), mutual
   destruction (mutual hostage), or transparency (developmental).
   Heterogeneous state-market relations help account for the persistence of
   foreign direct investment in markets that display both a great deal of
   corruption and a great deal of legality and transparency.

AB Foster children are at disproportionate risk of adverse outcomes
   throughout the life course. Public policy prioritizes permanency
   (exiting foster care through reunification with birth parents, adoption,
   or legal guardianship) to promote foster youths' healthy development and
   well-being, but little empirical evidence indicates that permanency,
   including its most preferred formreunificationpromotes positive
   outcomes. Using multi-system, statewide longitudinal administrative
   data, we employed logistic and mixed-effects regression to examine
   educational attainment and earnings among former foster youth in early
   adulthood. We found that youth who aged out of care had significantly
   higher odds of graduating high school and enrolling in college than did
   reunified youth and youth who exited to guardianship, and they had
   similar odds as adopted youth. Earnings were similar across groups.
   Among aged-out (but not reunified) youth, odds of high school graduation
   and average earnings were higher for youth who spent more time in foster
   care prior to age 18. Overall, results suggest that permanency alone is
   insufficient to promote foster youths' educational and economic
   attainment.

   rate. OCMT is easy to interpret, relates to classical statistical

   illustrated by an empirical application to forecasting U.S. output

AB Marketplaces are often small parts of large markets, and both markets
   and marketplaces come in many varieties. Market design seeks to
   understand what marketplaces must accomplish to enable different kinds
   of markets. Marketplaces can have varying degrees of success, and there
   can be marketplace failures. I'll discuss labor markets like the market
   for new economists, and also markets for new lawyers and doctors that
   have suffered from the unraveling of appointment dates to well before
   employment begins. Markets work best if they enjoy social support, but
   some markets are repugnant in the sense that some people think they
   should be banned, even though others want to participate in them. Laws
   banning such markets often contribute to the design of illegal black
   markets, and this raises new issues for market designers. I'll briefly
   discuss markets and black markets for narcotics, marijuana, sex, and
   surrogacy, and the design of markets for kidney transplants, in the face
   of widespread laws against (and broader repugnance for) compensating
   organ donors. I conclude with open questions and engineering challenges.

AB Prominent studies of electoral accountability and economic voting
   suggest that government constraints and international financial
   structures decrease the economic vote. The proposed mechanism is often
   labeled as the "room to maneuver," and it posits that because elected
   officials have limited space to propose and implement economic policy,
   politicians can shirk responsibility, and thus voters are less likely to
   place voting weights on the economy. However, results from elections
   that took place in Europe during the Great Recession and scholarly
   research on economic voting in these elections cast serious doubts on
   the causal mechanism. This article directly tests this mechanism with a
   survey experiment using data from Greece (the country most affected by
   the debt crisis). The results suggest that although the economic vote is
   strong and substantive, its size does not vary across the room to
   maneuver treatments. This finding informs the literature on economic
   voting and carries out important implications for party strategies with
   respect to exogenous policy impositions and their electoral effects.

   to predict multiple forms of conflict. Our results indicate the specific

AB In developing a theory of the first appropriation of natural resources
   from the state of nature, John Locke tells us that persons must leave
   enough and as good for others. Detailing exactly what this restriction
   requires divides right and left libertarians. Briefly, right
   libertarians interpret enough and as good as requiring no or very
   minimal restrictions on the first appropriation of natural resources,
   whereas left libertarians interpret enough and as good as requiring
   everyone to be entitled to an equal share of unappropriated resources,
   able to claim no more beyond this equal share. This article approaches
   the right versus left libertarian debate by developing a formal model
   that examines the welfare properties of different interpretations of the
   Lockean proviso. The model shows that underlying philosophical
   justifications for left libertarianism, when plausible assumptions hold,
   will actually be better served by a right libertarian proviso rather

AB Under what conditions does the global economy serve as a means for the

   among internationally engaged firms in their propensity to improve labor
   standards. Upgrading is most likely when a firm's products exhibit
   significant cross-market differences in markups, making accessing
   high-standards overseas markets particularly profitable. Additionally,
   upgrading is more likely when lead firms attach a high salience to labor
   standards. Therefore, while participation in global production induces
   trading up behaviors among firms overall, the effect strength varies
   across industries. We test our expectations via a survey experiment,
   which queries foreign firms operating in Vietnam about their willingness
   to invest in labor-related upgrading. We find strong evidence for the
   effect of markups on upgrading choices and suggestive evidence for the
   saliency mechanism.

   analyzes the debt of imprisonment, or the material costs of paternal
   incarceration; on the other, she examines the imprisonment of debt, or
   the punitive costs of child support debt. She then brings these two
   entanglements together to analyze their effects on men's lives as
   fathers. Instead of piling up in men's lives, these entanglements work
   in circular ways to form feedback loops of disadvantage that create
   serious obstacles for men as parents and complicate precisely those
   relationships proven essential for reintegration after prison: familial

   companies affected publication rates and provide systematic evidence of
   the impact of companies and state representation with a time-series

   analysis with data on author biographies and the changing contents of

AB At the turn of the twenty-first century, an important pair of studies
   established that greater female representation in government is
   associated with lower levels of perceived corruption in that government.
   But recent research finds that this relationship is not universal and
   questions why it exists. This article presents a new theory explaining
   why women's representation is only sometimes related to lower corruption
   levels and provides evidence in support of that theory. The study finds
   that the women's representation-corruption link is strongest when the
   risk of corruption being detected and punished by voters is high - in
   other words, when officials can be held electorally accountable. Two
   primary mechanisms underlie this theory: prior evidence shows that (1)
   women are more risk-averse than men and (2) voters hold women to a
   higher standard at the polls. This suggests that gender differences in
   corrupt behavior are proportional to the strength of electoral
   accountability. Consequently, the hypotheses predict that the empirical
   relationship between greater women's representation and lower perceived
   corruption will be strongest in democracies with high electoral
   accountability, specifically: (1) where corruption is not the norm, (2)
   where press freedom is respected, (3) in parliamentary systems and (4)
   under personalistic electoral rules. The article presents observational
   evidence that electoral accountability moderates the link between
   women's representation and corruption in a time-series, cross-sectional
   dataset of seventy-six democratic-leaning countries.

AB An emerging literature points to the heterogeneous effects of violence
   on social norms and preferences in conflict-ridden societies. This
   article considers how responses to violence could be affected by
   in-group/out-group divisions. The research uses lab-in-the-field
   experiments to gauge norms for pro-social behavior in the aftermath of
   ethnic violence in post-war Kosovo. The study finds that one set of
   treatments (ethnicity) captures a negative legacy of violence on
   parochialism, while another (local/non-local) shows stronger evidence of
   pro-sociality and norm recovery. Examining individual variation in
   conflict exposure, it finds that victims of violence are more biased
   against ethnic out-groups and less pro-social to others outside of their
   local community. Balancing and matching on observables helps alleviate

AB The criticism that ordinary voters lack the necessary competence to make
   policy decisions persists despite the growth, popularity and
   implementation of direct democratic instruments throughout the
   democratic world. This article presents a novel measure of voters'
   levels of justification as a possible, policy-specific,
   conceptualization of citizen competence in direct democracy. Using a
   unique dataset based on thirty-four ballot decisions in Switzerland, the
   study analyses the levels and correlates of citizen competence. The main
   findings are, first, that most voters do understand arguments about
   policies. Secondly, the political context as well as individual
   resources are important in determining voters' competence. Finally, with
   regard to individual resources, motivation is strongly associated with
   justification levels, while the effect of ability is smaller than
   expected.

AB We study trading behavior and the properties of prices in
   informationally complex markets. Our model is based on the single-period
   version of the linear-normal framework of Kyle (1985). We allow for
   essentially arbitrary correlations among the random variables involved
   in the model: the value of the traded asset, the signals of strategic
   traders and competitive market makers, and the demand from liquidity
   traders. We show that there always exists a unique linear equilibrium,
   characterize it analytically, and illustrate its properties with a
   number of applications. We then use this characterization to study the
   informational efficiency of prices as the number of strategic traders
   becomes large. If liquidity demand is positively correlated (or
   uncorrelated) with the asset value, then prices in large markets
   aggregate all available information. If liquidity demand is negatively
   correlated with the asset value, then prices in large markets aggregate
   all information except that contained in liquidity demand.

AB In regression discontinuity (RD), a running variable (or "score")
   crossing a cutoff determines a treatment that affects the
   mean-regression function. This paper generalizes this usual "one-score
   mean RD" in three ways: (i) considering multiple scores, (ii) allowing
   partial effects due to each score crossing its own cutoff, not just the
   full effect with all scores crossing all cutoffs, and (iii)
   accommodating quantile/mode regressions. This generalization is
   motivated by (i) many multiple-score RD cases, (ii) the full-effect
   identification needing the partial effects to be separated, and (iii)
   informative quantile/mode regression functions. We establish
   identification for multiple-score RD (MRD), and propose simple
   estimators that become "local difference in differences" in case of
   double scores. We also provide an empirical illustration where partial
   effects exist.

AB We explore the learning process and behavior of an individual with
   unrealistically high expectations (overconfidence) when outcomes also
   depend on an external fundamental that affects the optimal action.
   Moving beyond existing results in the literature, we show that the
   agent's beliefs regarding the fundamental converge under weak
   conditions. Furthermore, we identify a broad class of situations in
   which learning about the fundamental is self-defeating: it leads the
   individual systematically away from the correct belief and toward lower
   performance. Due to his overconfidence, the agenteven if initially
   correctbecomes too pessimistic about the fundamental. As he adjusts his
   behavior in response, he lowers outcomes and hence becomes even more
   pessimistic about the fundamental, perpetuating the misdirected
   learning. The greater is the loss from choosing a suboptimal action, the
   further the agent's action ends up from optimal. We partially
   characterize environments in which self-defeating learning occurs, and
   show that the decisionmaker learns to take the optimal action if, and in
   a sense only if, a specific non-identifiability condition is satisfied.
   In contrast to an overconfident agent, an underconfident agent's
   misdirected learning is self-limiting and therefore not very harmful. We
   argue that the decision situations in question are common in economic
   settings, including delegation, organizational, effort, and
   public-policy choices.

AB Which equilibria will arise in signaling games depends on how the

   micro-foundation for these off-path beliefs, and an associated
   equilibrium refinement, in a model where equilibrium arises through
   non-equilibrium learning by populations of patient and long-lived
   senders and receivers. In our model, young senders are uncertain about
   the prevailing distribution of play, so they rationally send
   out-of-equilibrium signals as experiments to learn about the behavior of
   the population of receivers. Differences in the payoff functions of the
   types of senders generate different incentives for these experiments.
   Using the Gittins index (Gittins (1979)), we characterize which sender
   types use each signal more often, leading to a constraint on the
   receiver's off-path beliefs based on type compatibility and hence a
   learning-based equilibrium selection.

   the sum of the weights differs from 1. We show that when we restrict the

   quasilinearity, a more abstract duality relationship, known as a Galois

   weaker, this duality relationship still induces substantial structure.
   We show that this structure can be used to extend existing results for,

AB To study intertemporal decisions under risk, we develop a new recursive
   model of non-expected-utility preferences. The main axiom of our
   analysis is called mixture aversion, as it captures a dislike of
   probabilistic mixtures of lotteries. Our representation for
   mixture-averse preferences can be interpreted as if an individual
   optimally selects her risk attitude from some feasible set. We describe
   some useful parametric examples of our representation and provide
   comparative statics that tightly link decreases in risk aversion to
   larger sets of feasible risk attitudes. We then present several
   applications of the model. In an insurance problem, mixture-averse
   preferences can produce a marginal willingness to pay for insurance
   coverage that increases in the level of existing coverage. In investment
   decisions, our model can generate endogenous heterogeneity in
   equilibrium stock market participation, even when consumers have
   identical preferences. Finally, we demonstrate that our model can
   address the Rabin paradox even in the presence of reasonable levels of
   background risk.

AB The popularity of online surveys has increased the prominence of using
   sampling weights to enhance claims of representativeness. Yet, much
   uncertainty remains regarding how these weights should be employed in
   survey experiment analysis: should they be used? If so, which estimators
   are preferred? We offer practical advice, rooted in the Neyman-Rubin
   model, for researchers working with survey experimental data. We examine
   simple, efficient estimators, and give formulas for their biases and
   variances. We provide simulations that examine these estimators as well
   as real examples from experiments administered online through YouGov. We
   find that for examining the existence of population treatment effects
   using high-quality, broadly representative samples recruited by top
   online survey firms, sample quantities, which do not rely on weights,
   are often sufficient. We found that sample average treatment effect
   (SATE) estimates did not appear to differ substantially from their
   weighted counterparts, and they avoided the substantial loss of
   statistical power that accompanies weighting. When precise estimates of
   population average treatment effects (PATE) are essential, we
   analytically show poststratifying on survey weights and/or covariates
   highly correlated with outcomes to be a conservative choice. While we
   show substantial gains in simulations, we find limited evidence of them
   in practice.

AB Accumulated evidence identifies discernible gender gaps across many
   dimensions of professional academic careers including salaries,
   publication rates, journal placement, career progress, and academic
   service. Recent work in political science also reveals gender gaps in
   citations, with articles written by men citing work by other male
   scholars more often than work by female scholars. This study estimates
   the gender gap in citations across political science subfields and
   across methodological subfields within political science, sociology, and
   economics. The research design captures variance across research areas
   in terms of the underlying distribution of female scholars. We expect
   that subfields within political science and social science disciplines
   with more women will have smaller gender citation gaps, a reduction of
   the "Matthew effect" where men's research is viewed as the most central
   and important in a field. However, gender citation gaps may persist if a
   "Matilda effect" occurs whereby women's research is viewed as less
   important or their ideas are attributed to male scholars, even as a
   field becomes more diverse. Analysing all articles published from
   2007-2016 in several journals, we find that female scholars are
   significantly more likely than mixed gender or male author teams to cite
   research by their female peers, but that these citation rates vary
   depending on the overall distribution of women in their field. More
   gender diverse subfields and disciplines produce smaller gender citation
   gaps, consistent with a reduction in the "Matthew effect". However, we
   also observe undercitation of work by women, even in journals that
   publish mostly female authors. While improvements in gender diversity in
   academia increase the visibility and impact of scholarly work by women,
   implicit biases in citation practices in the social sciences persist.

AB In this comment on Dion, Sumner, and Mitchell's article "Gendered
   Citation Patterns across Political Science and Social Science
   Methodology Fields," I explore the role of changes in the disparities of
   citations to work written by women over time. Breaking down their
   citation data by era, I find that some of the patterns in citations are
   the result of the legacy of disparity in the field. Citations to more
   recent work come closer to matching the distribution of the gender of
   authors of published work. Although the need for more equitable
   practices of citation remains, the overall patterns are not quite as bad
   as Dion, Sumner, and Mitchell conclude.

   signal strength across space. Such data are useful to social scientists
   interested in identifying the effects of mass media broadcasts when (i)
   individual-level data on media exposure do not exist or when (ii) media
   exposure, while observed, is not exogenous. We illustrate the use of

AB We use plausibly exogenous variation in the availability of the Russian
   analog television signal in Ukraine to study how a media source with a
   conspicuous political agenda impacts political behavior and attitudes.
   Using highly disaggregated election data and an original survey, we
   estimate that Russian television substantially increased average
   electoral support for parties and candidates with a "pro-Russian" agenda
   in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. Evidence suggests
   that this effect is attributable to persuasion rather than differential
   mobilization. The effectiveness of biased media varied in a politically
   consequential way: Its impact was largest on voters with strong
   pro-Russian priors but was less effective, and to some degree even
   counter-effective, in persuading those with strong pro-Western priors.
   Our finding suggests that exposing an already polarized society to a
   biased media source can result in even deeper polarization.

   religious and secular orientations are endogenous to political
   orientations. In other words, religion and secularism are a consequence
   as well as a cause of politics. In showing this, we make three major
   contributions. First, we conceptualize and measure secular orientations
   in a new way-not just as the absence of religion, but also as an
   affirmative secular identity and positive commitment to secular
   principles. Second, our panel and experimental data allow for the most
   definitive test to date of whether political orientations exert a causal
   effect on religious and secular orientations. Third, we isolate the
   conditions under which politics affects religious-secular perspectives,
   thus identifying the mechanism that underlies political orientations.

   evolution of interstate disputes by using an infinitely repeated and
   dynamic game of crisis escalation. Unlike past efforts, our approach
   estimates country-specific audience cost parameters without relying on
   proxy variables, such as democracy measures. Contrary to intuition,
   increases in a country's audience costs encourage it to initiate
   disputes in equilibrium because the costs serve as a commitment device
   during the subsequent crisis, incentivizing the country to stand firm
   and coercing its opponent to back down. Nonetheless, the results
   demonstrate that larger audience costs would result in more peace
   worldwide, as they also discourage potential opponents from initiating
   disputes. Beyond regime type, we find that a free press, provisions for
   executive appointment or removal, and historical rivalries are also
   important determinants of audience costs.

   organizations need to win over crucial parts of society to generate the
   necessary support that allows them to attain favorable civil conflict
   outcomes. We find empirical support for the argument that low-income
   individuals who initially fight the government (rebel organizations)
   have to convince middle-class individuals to turn out against the
   government to gain government concessions. Empirically, we demonstrate
   that government concessions in the form of peace agreements and the

   the education of their children on their propensity to directly voice
   their preferences with the education policy through government citizen
   surveys and their tendency to vote in elections. Among these normally
   underrepresented citizens, coproduction increased their propensity to
   voice their preferences to politicians through citizen surveys but not
   their tendency to vote. The effect on voicing in government citizen

   model depends, I argue that opposing partisans who share the
   superordinate identity of being a woman will not reduce their intergroup
   biases. Instead, I predict that raising the salience of their gender
   will increase cross-party biases. I support my hypotheses with a
   nationally representative survey of 3,000 adult women and two survey
   experiments, each with over 1,000 adult women. These findings have
   direct implications for how women evaluate one another in contentious

AB Legislatures differ in their institutional capacity to draft and enact

   outcomes to the electorate's preferences, they can also inject
   uncertainty into markets with their ability to alter the political
   economic landscape. We argue that this uncertainty will manifest in a
   state's ability to borrow and hypothesize a negative relationship
   between legislative capacity and creditworthiness. Using ratings of
   general obligation bonds issued by the American states over nearly two
   decades and data on the institutional capacity of state legislative
   assemblies, we find support for the claim that having a legislature that
   is better equipped to affect policy change increases credit risk
   evaluations. The results we present broaden our understanding of the
   importance of legislative institutions, the determinants of credit risk,
   and the economic implications of democratic responsiveness.

   composition in terms of partisanship, ideology, and the numerical
   strength of powerful interest groups. But, in contrast to prominent
   theories of election timing, these effects are modest in terms of their
   likely impact on election outcomes. Instead, timing has the most
   significant impact on voter age, with the elderly being the most
   overrepresented group in low-turnout special elections. The electoral

   offer one explanation for this variation.

AB A recurring challenge in politics is to convince actors to take
   cooperative actions against their self-interest. This is especially
   challenging for executives conducting covert activities, as infractions
   are unobservable and institutional reforms often require the executive's
   consent. We develop a model based in the auditing literature to
   investigate when executives agree to reforms that credibly constrain
   their behaviors. If the revelation cost falls in a high range, the risk
   of whistleblowing convinces executives to restrain themselves.
   Executives cannot credibly commit to this when the costs are low,
   resulting in inefficient investigations from watchdog groups that tax
   executive resources. We show that executives are sometimes better off in
   the first case than the second, which results in executives endogenously
   reforming institutions to achieve this outcome. We illustrate the
   mechanism with a case study of Gerald Ford's executive reforms to the
   intelligence community in the 1970s.

   Contrary to the race to the bottom hypothesis, it finds that retail
   importers reward exporters for complying with social standards. In
   difference-in-differences estimates from over 2,000 manufacturing
   establishments in 36 countries, achieving compliance is associated with
   a 4% [1%, 7%] average increase in annual purchasing. The effect is

   introduce a family of tree-based nonparametric techniques that may, in
   some circumstances, be more appropriate than traditional methods for
   confronting these data challenges. In particular, tree models are very
   effective for detecting nonlinearities and interactions, even in data
   sets with many (potentially irrelevant) covariates. We introduce the
   basic logic of tree-based models, provide an overview of the most
   prominent methods in the literature, and conduct three analyses that
   illustrate how the methods can be implemented while highlighting both

AB Computational models have been underutilized as tools for formal theory

   generally do not employ the language or modes of analysis common to

   types of insights typically derived from game-theoretic models and
   discuss analogues in computational modeling. Second, there are not
   widely established procedures for analysis of deductive computational
   models. I present a regularized method for deriving comparative statics
   from computational models that provides insights comparable to those
   arising from game-theoretic analyses. It also serves as a framework for
   building theoretically tractable computational models. Together, these
   contributions should enhance communication between models of social
   science and open up the tool kit of deductive computational modeling for

AB In principle, experiments offer a straightforward method for social
   scientists to accurately estimate causal effects. However, scholars
   often unwittingly distort treatment effect estimates by conditioning on
   variables that could be affected by their experimental manipulation.
   Typical examples include controlling for posttreatment variables in
   statistical models, eliminating observations based on posttreatment
   criteria, or subsetting the data based on posttreatment variables.
   Though these modeling choices are intended to address common problems
   encountered when conducting experiments, they can bias estimates of
   causal effects. Moreover, problems associated with conditioning on
   posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in the field, which
   we show frequently publishes experimental studies using these practices
   in our discipline's most prestigious journals. We demonstrate the
   severity of experimental posttreatment bias analytically and document
   the magnitude of the potential distortions it induces using
   visualizations and reanalyses of real-world data. We conclude by
   providing applied researchers with recommendations for best practice.

   through the heightened risk of subsequent imprisonment. Negative

   Drawing on 100 qualitative interviews with white, black,
   Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and Native Americans, the authors develop the
   genetic options theory to account for how genetic ancestry tests
   influence consumers' ethnic and racial identities. The theory maintains
   that consumers do not accept the tests' results as given but choose
   selectively from the estimates according to two mechanisms: their
   identity aspirations and social appraisals. Yet consumers' prior
   racialization also influences their identity aspirations; white
   respondents aspired to new identities more readily and in substantively
   different ways. The authors' findings suggest that genetic ancestry
   testing can reinforce race privilege among those who already experience

   after a decline in the 1990s, there was an increase in 2000-2010 that
   reinforced concerns about the overall growth in U.S. income inequality
   since the 1970s. Yet the evidence may be systematically biased to
   exacerbate the upward trend because the effective sample for the
   American Community Survey (ACS) is much smaller than it was for the 2000
   census to which it is being compared. Apparent changes in disparities
   across census tracts may result partly from a higher level of sampling
   variation and bias due to the smaller sample. This study uses 100%
   microdata from the 1940 census to simulate the impact of different
   sampling rates and applies those approaches to publicly available data
   for 2000 and 2007-11. The reduction in sample sizes associated with the

AB Usually pictured in relations of opposition, political parties are
   sometimes inclined to make alliances. This article examines the ethical
   questions such arrangements give rise to. It considers first the formal
   characteristics of an alliance as a distinctive form of association,
   moving on to examine what reasons for alliance are good reasons.
   Intrinsic arguments that invoke epistemic or democratic criteria, and
   instrumental arguments that cite areas of shared programme or imperfect
   institutions, are weighed in turn, with the latter judged to be more
   consistent with the partisan ethos. The final section examines the
   normative standards to which alliances should be held once formed.

AB Policies designed to increase women's representation in Africa are often
   motivated by the assumption that men and women have different policy
   preferences. This article finds that gender differences in policy
   priorities are actually quite small on average, but vary significantly
   across policy domains and countries. The study leverages this variation
   to show that the economic and social empowerment of women influences the
   size of gender gaps in the prioritization of two important domains. In
   particular, women's participation in the labor force - an indicator of
   economic empowerment - narrows the gender gap in the prioritization of
   infrastructure investment and access to clean water, while social
   vulnerability widens the gap on prioritizing infrastructure investment.
   Finally, the article shows that the places where women and men have the
   most divergent policy preferences - and thus where formal representation
   is most important - are precisely the places where women are currently
   the most poorly represented and least active in formal politics.

AB Recent research on political discussion has focused on whether aspects
   of interaction create a 'democratic dilemma' for the mass public in
   which people face a choice between political participation and political
   tolerance. This article argues that there are important variations in
   how people react to their immediate social contacts. It explores this
   idea by studying how social disagreement and expertise interact with
   gender to explain variance in political participation. First, it shows
   that there are conflicting expectations in the literature about how such
   dynamics should manifest, despite agreement that men and women should
   experience different kinds and degrees of social influence. Secondly, it
   examines these expectations by revisiting prominent, network-based
   explanations of political participation; it finds that these
   relationships do not display consistency across sex differences. The
   results point to the existence of varied 'social logics' for men and
   women, and suggest the need to reconsider how to think about the
   efficacy of discussion and disagreement in a democratic society.

AB Governments face different incentives when they reorganize many
   administrative agencies at one time rather than making infrequent,
   case-by-case changes. This article develops a theory of mass
   administrative reorganizations, which posits that the politics of
   reorganization is focused on government accountability. Viewing mass
   reorganization as a structured decision, it argues that choices about
   independence, agency organization and functional disposition have
   different impacts on the political costs of administrative policy
   making. Analyzing novel data from a recent British reorganization with
   sequential logistic statistical models provides substantial support for
   these claims. The study challenges the focus on organizational survival
   in the existing literature. By eschewing more fundamental political
   questions of democratic accountability, the prevailing approach masks
   essential politics, and in the context of this study, all influence of
   conflict due to party and agency policy positions.

AB How do crises affect trade policy? This article reconciles starkly
   diverging accounts in the literature by showing that economic adversity
   generates endogenous incentives not only for protection, but also for
   liberalization. It first formally develops the mechanisms by which two
   features of shocks - intensity and duration - influence the resources
   and political strategies of distressed firms. The central insight is
   that policy adjustments to resuscitate afflicted industries typically
   generate 'knock-on' effects on the profitability and political
   maneuverings of other firms in the economy. The study incorporates these
   countervailing pressures in its analysis of trade policy competition. In
   the wake of crises, protection initially increases when affected firms
   lobby for assistance, but then decreases as industries run low on
   resources to expend on lobbying and as firms in other industries
   mobilize to counter-lobby. The theoretical predictions are tested using
   sub-national and cross-national data, and real-world illustrations are
   presented to highlight the mechanisms driving the results.

AB Does the attention of human rights organizations limit exports from
   rights-abusing states? This article examines how naming and shaming by
   human rights organizations (HROs) conditions the influence of human
   rights abuse on exports, and argues that human rights abuse alone is
   insufficient to damage a state's exports. However, as attention to abuse
   via HRO shaming increases, abuse has an increasingly negative impact on
   exports. Importantly, this relationship is also conditional on the
   respect for human rights among importing states; human rights abuse,
   even if it is shamed, has no effect when importers are similarly
   abusive. Empirical tests utilizing gravity models of trade incorporating
   data on physical integrity rights abuse and HRO shaming in 1990-2008
   yield strong support for our expectations.

AB Previous research shows that the household context is a crucial source
   of influence on turnout. This article sets out a relational theory of
   voting in which turnout is dependent on the existence of relational
   selective consumption benefits. The study provides empirical tests of
   key elements of the proposed model using household survey data from
   Great Britain. First, building on expressive theories of voting, it
   examines the extent to which shared partisan identification enhances
   turnout. Secondly, extending theories of voting as a social norm, it
   tests whether the civic norms of citizens' families or households affect
   turnout over and above the social norms of the individual. In accordance
   with expectations of expressive theories of voting, it finds that having
   a shared party identification with other members of the household
   increases turnout. It also finds that the civic duty of other household
   members is important in explaining turnout, even when allowing for
   respondent's civic duty.
