AB The absence of a trend in hours worked in the postwar United States is
   an exception: across countries and historically, hours fall steadily by
   a little below 0.5% per year. Are steadily falling hours consistent with
   a stable utility function over consumption and leisure under balanced
   growth of the macroeconomic aggregates? Yes. We fully characterize the
   class of such functions and thus generalize the well-known
   "balanced-growth preferences" that demand constant (as opposed to
   falling) long-run hours. Key to falling hours is an income effect (of
   steady productivity growth on hours) that slightly outweighs the
   substitution effect.

AB Exploiting admission thresholds to the Bologna day care system, we show
   using a regression discontinuity (RD) design that one additional day
   care month at age 0-2 reduces intelligence quotient by 0.5% (4.7% of a
   standard deviation) at age 8-14 in a relatively affluent population. The
   magnitude of this negative effect increases with family income. Similar
   negative impacts are found for personality traits. These findings are
   consistent with the hypothesis from psychology that children in day care
   experience fewer one-to-one interactions with adults, with negative
   effects in families where such interactions are of higher quality. We
   embed this hypothesis in a model that lends structure to our RD design.

   homothetic recursive preferences. Agents with more incorrect beliefs
   dominate, or agents with different accuracy of their beliefs coexist in
   the long run, for broad ranges of plausible parameterizations when risk
   aversion is greater than the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of

   sharing, speculative behavior and consumption-saving choice of agents
   with heterogeneous beliefs, and the role of equilibrium prices in

AB Social insurance is often linked to marriage. Existing evidence suggests
   small marital responses to financial incentives and stems from settings
   where benefits are realized in the near future. I analyze how linking
   survivors insurance to marriage affects the marriage market. Exploiting
   Sweden's elimination of survivors insurance, I demonstrate that severing
   this link (1) affected entry into marriage up to 50 years before
   expected payout, (2) raised the divorce rate by 10%, and (3) raised the
   assortativeness of matching. This suggests that marital behavior is a
   key component of couples' strategies to plan for financial security in

AB Income inequality is fundamentally relational in nature, but research on
   the American public's response to it tends to examine individuals in
   isolation, concluding that support for redistribution is unresponsive to
   inequality. We focus instead on perceptions of relative socioeconomic
   position, which we manipulate experimentally through imagined social
   interactions with high- or low-status others. We find that subjects who
   make social comparisons between themselves and someone who is
   socioeconomically advantaged perceive their own status as lower, assess
   their own socioeconomic status more accurately, and become more
   supportive of social welfare spending, even though we provide no factual
   information about the income distribution to subjects in the experiment.
   Our findings demonstrate that Americans respond with support for
   redistribution when conditions facilitate upward social comparison. We
   argue for a shift in scholarly attention to the structural factors that
   keep rising upper-tail inequality socially invisible.

AB Using detailed panel data from the Pale of Settlement area between 1800
   and 1927, we document that anti-Jewish pogroms-mob violence against the
   Jewish minority-broke out when economic shocks coincided with political
   turmoil. When this happened, pogroms primarily occurred in places where
   Jews dominated middleman occupations, i.e., moneylending and grain
   trading. This evidence is inconsistent with the scapegoating hypothesis,
   according to which Jews were blamed for all misfortunes of the majority.
   Instead, the evidence is consistent with the politico-economic
   mechanism, in which Jewish middlemen served as providers of insurance
   against economic shocks to peasants and urban grain buyers in a
   relationship based on repeated interactions. When economic shocks
   occurred in times of political stability, rolling over or forgiving
   debts was an equilibrium outcome because both sides valued their future
   relationship. In contrast, during political turmoil, debtors could not
   commit to paying in the future, and consequently, moneylenders and grain
   traders had to demand immediate (re)payment. This led to ethnic
   violence, in which the break in the relationship between the majority
   and Jewish middlemen was the igniting factor.

AB This paper joins the debate on the formation of territorial stigma by
   uncovering the existence of a form of "foundational stigma" that
   preceded place-based stigma of the era of advanced marginality. I show
   that not only were the traces of stigma present prior to the era of
   advanced marginality but that these early traces facilitate later forms
   of stigma by providing the necessary foundations upon which adhesive and
   detrimental stigma was operationalized. Following a critical discourse
   analysis approach, this paper examines coverage in the British press of
   Toxteth, Liverpool between 1900 and 1981 as a paradigmatic case study to
   show that this primitive stigma existed in three key ways: relating to
   inter-community strife, to crime, and to substandard housing conditions.
   These traces of stigma laid the foundations for later forms of stigma
   based on the presence of the poor, violent, deviant other that would be
   operationalized by dominant voices during the era of advanced
   marginality.

AB Spatial econometric models become increasingly popular in various
   subfields of political science. However, the necessity to specify the
   underlying network of dependencies, denoted by \boldsymbol{W} , prior to
   estimation is a prevalent source of criticism since the true dependence
   structure is rarely known and theories mostly provide insufficient
   guidance. The present study investigates the effects of this network
   uncertainty which is a special case of model uncertainty that arises
   from uncertainty about the correct specification of boldsymbol{W} . It
   advocates Bayesian model averaging (BMA) as a superior approach to this
   problem, located at the intersection of theory and empirics. Conducting
   Monte Carlo experiments, I demonstrate that, while the effect estimates
   are robust toward a misspecification in the functional form of
   \boldsymbol{W} , uncertainty in the neighborhood definition can bias the
   effect estimates derived from spatial autoregressive models. In contrast
   to alternative techniques, BMA directly addresses network uncertainty,
   correctly identifies the true network structure in the set of feasible
   alternatives, and provides unbiased effect estimates. Two replication
   studies from different subfields of the discipline illustrate the
   benefits of this approach for applied research.

AB Classical generalized linear models assume that marginal effects are
   homogeneous in the population given the observed covariates. Researchers
   can never be sure a priori if that assumption is adequate. Recent
   literature in statistics and political science have proposed models that
   use Dirichlet process priors to deal with the possibility of latent
   heterogeneity in the covariate effects. In this paper, we extend and
   generalize those approaches and propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process
   of generalized linear models in which the latent heterogeneity can
   depend on context-level features. Such a model is important in
   comparative analyses when the data comes from different countries and
   the latent heterogeneity can be a function of country-level features. We
   provide a Gibbs sampler for the general model, a special Gibbs sampler
   for gaussian outcome variables, and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo within
   Gibbs to handle discrete outcome variables. We demonstrate the
   importance of accounting for latent heterogeneity with a Monte Carlo
   exercise and with two applications that replicate recent scholarly work.
   We show how Simpson's paradox can emerge in the empirical analysis if
   latent heterogeneity is ignored and how the proposed model can be used
   to estimate heterogeneity in the effect of covariates.

   allocation, we utilize the terms that comprise the topics, together with
   a gradient descent solver, to assess the classifier's predictive
   accuracy. Using 10,597 documents from the official websites of radical
   right and ethnic political parties in Slovakia (2004-2014), the analysis
   predicts which political issues will elicit partisan reactions, and
   which will be ignored, with an accuracy of 83% (F-measure) and
   outperforms both Random Forest and Naive Bayes classifiers. Subject
   matter experts validate the approach and interpret the results.

AB Ecological inference (EI) is the process of learning about individual

   "linear contextual effects," which previous works have regarded as
   plausible but avoided due to nonidentification, a problem we sidestep by
   deriving bounds instead of point estimates. In this way, we offer a
   conceptual framework to improve on the Duncan-Davis bound, derived more
   than 65 years ago. To study the effectiveness of our approach, we
   collect and analyze 8,430 2\times 2 EI datasets with known ground truth
   from several sources-thus bringing considerably more data to bear on the
   problem than the existing dozen or so datasets available in the
   literature for evaluating EI estimators. For the 88% of real data sets
   in our collection that fit a proposed rule, our approach reduces the
   width of the Duncan-Davis bound, on average, by about 44%, while still
   capturing the true district-level parameter about 99% of the time. The
   remaining 12% revert to the Duncan-Davis bound.

AB Word vectorization is an emerging text-as-data method that shows great
   promise for automating the analysis of semantics-here, the cultural
   meanings of words-in large volumes of text. Yet successes with this
   method have largely been confined to massive corpora where the meanings
   of words are presumed to be fixed. In political science applications,
   however, many corpora are comparatively small and many interesting
   questions hinge on the recognition that meaning changes over time.
   Together, these two facts raise vexing methodological challenges. Can
   word vectors trace the changing cultural meanings of words in typical
   small corpora use cases? I test four time-sensitive implementations of
   word vectors (word2vec) against a gold standard developed from a modest
   data set of 161 years of newspaper coverage. I find that one
   implementation method clearly outperforms the others in matching human
   assessments of how public dialogues around equality in America have
   changed over time. In addition, I suggest best practices for using
   word2vec to study small corpora for time series questions, including
   bootstrap resampling of documents and pretraining of vectors. I close by
   showing that word2vec allows granular analysis of the changing meaning
   of words, an advance over other common text-as-data methods for semantic
   research questions.

   our results against indicators from the Comparative Manifestos Project,
   surveys of experts, and measures based on roll-call votes. Our findings
   suggest that party embeddings are successful at capturing latent

AB Power law distributions have a certain appeal to researchers, not least
   because they often insinuate a general empirical law. Hence, searching
   for them in data generated by social and political processes has become
   popular. In the political science literature, however, power law
   behavior has rarely been assessed rigorously. Relying mainly on
   qualitative appraisals of log-log plots, merely a necessary, but no
   sufficient, condition of power law behavior is tested. This letter
   therefore seconds the note of caution expressed recently. Moreover, it
   showcases the use of a principled statistical framework to test power
   law behavior in a quantitative manner. Applying this method to a seminal
   case in political science, the results of the analysis invite an
   empirical as well as theoretical refinement of the claim that changes in
   public budgets follow a power law. In a more general sense, the letter
   wishes to contribute to a more thorough practice of stochastic process

AB This letter deals with a very simple question: if we have grouped data
   with a binary-dependent variable and want to include fixed effects in
   the specification, can we meaningfully compare results using a linear
   model to those estimated with a logit? The reason to doubt such a
   comparison is that the linear specification appears to keep all
   observations, whereas the logit drops the groups where the dependent
   variable is either all zeros or all ones. This letter demonstrates that
   a linear specification averages the estimates for all the homogeneous
   outcome groups (which, by definition, all have slope coefficients of
   zero) with the slope coefficients for the groups with a mix of zeros and
   ones. The correct comparison of the linear to logit form is to only look
   at groups with some variation in the dependent variable. Researchers
   using the linear specification are urged to report results for all
   groups and for the subset of groups where the dependent variable varies.
   The interpretation of the difference between these two results depends
   upon assumptions which cannot be empirically assessed.

   morally valuable practices. The status of such goods is examined, and
   distinctions are drawn between their manifest and latent, and
   transposable and situationally specific, characteristics. We integrate
   this refined idea of internal goods into a developed conception of
   habitus that is both morally informed and situationally embedded. The
   sociological approach of strong structuration theory (SST) is employed
   to demonstrate how this conception of habitus can guide the critique of
   decision-making that damages internal goods. We identify the most
   pervasive and invidious forms of damaging decision-making in
   contemporary societies as those involving excessive forms of
   instrumental reasoning. We argue that our developed conception of
   habitus, anchored in the collectively valued practices of specific
   worlds, can be a powerful focus for resistance. Accounts of scholarship
   in higher education and of the white working class in America illustrate
   the specificities of singular, particular, social worlds and illuminate
   critical challenges raised by the perspective we advocate.

AB Does more media censorship imply more regime stability? We argue that
   censorship may cause mass disapproval for censoring regimes. In
   particular, we expect that censorship backfires when citizens can
   falsify media content through alternative sources of information. We
   empirically test our theoretical argument in an autocratic regime-the
   German Democratic Republic (GDR). Results demonstrate how exposed state
   censorship on the country's emigration crisis fueled outrage in the
   weeks before the 1989 revolution. Combining original weekly approval
   surveys on GDR state television and daily content data of West German
   news programs with a quasi-experimental research design, we show that
   recipients disapproved of censorship if they were able to detect
   misinformation through conflicting reports on Western television. Our
   findings have important implications for the study of censoring systems
   in contemporary autocracies, external democracy promotion, and campaigns
   aimed at undermining trust in traditional journalism.

AB Governments' attempts to manage immigration increasingly restrict
   immigrants' eligibility to healthcare, education, and welfare benefits.
   This article examines the operation of these restrictions in the United
   Kingdom. It draws on qualitative research with civil servants and NGO
   expert advisors, and applies sociological theories on bureaucracy as a
   lens to interpret these data. Conceptually, the paper employs a
   generative synthesis of Ritzer's notion of "irrational rationality" and
   Foucault's perspective on "governmentality" to explain observed
   outcomes. Findings show that public service workers struggle with
   complex and opaque regulations, which grant different entitlements to
   different categories of migrants. The confusion results in mistakes,
   arbitrary decisions, and hypercorrection, but also a system-wide
   indifference to irrational outcomes, supported by human factors in
   contexts of austerity. I consider this a form of
   governmentality-effected neglect, where power operates as much through
   inaction as well as through intention, but which results in exclusions
   of legal migrants that are harsher in practice than in law.

AB Understanding and addressing the consequences of partisan animosity
   requires knowledge of its foundations. To what extent is animosity
   between partisan groups motivated by dislike for partisan outgroups per
   se, policy disagreement, or other social group conflicts? In many
   circumstances, including extant experimental research, these patterns
   are observationally equivalent. In a series of vignette evaluation
   experiments, we estimate effects of shared partisanship when additional
   information is or is not present, and we benchmark these effects against
   shared policy preference effects. Partisanship effects are about 71% as
   large as shared policy preference effects when each is presented in
   isolation. When an independently randomized party and policy position
   are presented together, partisanship effects decrease substantially, by
   about 52%, whereas policy effects remain large, decreasing by about 10%.
   These results suggest that common measures of partisan animosity may
   capture programmatic conflict more so than social identity-based
   partisan hostility.

AB Political science generally treats identities such as ethnicity,
   religion, and sexuality as "unmoved movers" in the chain of causality. I
   hypothesize that the growing salience of partisanship and ideology as
   social identities in the United States, combined with the increasing
   demographic distinctiveness of the nation's two political coalitions, is
   leading some Americans to engage in a self-categorization and
   depersonalization process in which they shift their identities toward
   the demographic prototypes of their political groups. Analyses of a
   representative panel data set that tracks identities and political
   affiliations over a 4-year span confirm that small but significant
   shares of Americans engage in identity switching regarding ethnicity,
   religion, sexual orientation, and class that is predicted by
   partisanship and ideology in their pasts, bringing their identities into
   alignment with their politics. These findings enrich and complicate our
   understanding of the relationship between identity and politics and
   suggest caution in treating identities as unchanging phenomena.

AB How do Norwegian migration and diversity researchers experience and
   maneuver participation in public debate? And do their experiences and
   strategies fit with Michael Burawoy's image of Norwegian social science
   and with his model of public sociology? In this article, the concept of
   public sociology is expanded to public social science, encompassing
   communication of research not just from sociology but social science in
   general. Semi-structured interviews with 31 Norwegian migration and
   diversity scholars from 10 academic institutions about their experiences
   of, and views on, public research communication constitute the empirical
   material. The article concludes that Burawoy is right about the
   relatively high participation in public debate among social scientists
   in Norway. And his ideal-typical distinction between four types of
   sociology is helpful in analyzing how researchers relate differently to
   the science-public interface. Yet the results indicate that his
   perspective on public sociology is overly optimistic and not
   sufficiently attuned to the normativity already attached to highly
   politicized issues in public debate.

AB This article reports on an ethnography of architectural projects for
   later life social care in the UK. Informed by recent debates in material
   studies and "materialities of care" we offer an analysis of a care home
   project that is sensitive to architectural materials that are not
   normally associated with care and well-being. Although the care home
   design project we focus on in this article was never built, we found
   that design discussions relating to a curved brick wall and bricks more
   generally were significant to its architectural "making". The curved
   wall and the bricks were used by the architects to encode quality and
   values of care into their design. This was explicit in the design
   narrative that was core to a successful tender submitted by a consortium
   comprising architects, developers, contractors, and a care provider to a
   local authority who commissioned the care home. However, as the project
   developed, initial consensus for the design features fractured. Using a
   materialized analysis, we document the tussles generated by the curved
   wall and the bricks and argue that mundane building materials can be
   important to, and yet marginalized within, the relations inherent to an
   "architectural care assemblage." During the design process we saw how
   decisions about materials are contentious and they act as a catalyst of
   negotiations that compromise "materialities of care."

AB The use of prototypes as testing instruments has become a common
   strategy in the innovation of services and products and increasingly in
   the implementation of "smart" urban policies through living labs or
   pilots. As a technique for validating hypotheses about the future
   performance of products or policies, prototyping is based on the idea of
   generating original knowledge through the failures produced during the
   testing process. Through the study of an experimentation and prototyping
   project developed in Santiago de Chile called "Shared Streets for a
   Low-Carbon District," I analyse the technique of prototyping as a
   political device that can make visible (or invisible) certain entities
   and issues, determining what the experimental entities can do and say. I
   will show how the technique of prototyping defines modes of
   participation, what is visible and thinkable, what can be spoken and
   what is unspeakable. In this sense, I examine two ambivalent capacities
   of prototyping: as a mechanism of management and enrolment that seeks to
   prescribe normativities (problem-validating prototype) and as an event
   that can make frictions tangible, articulating matters of concern and
   ways to open up alternative scenarios (problem-making prototype).

AB In this article, we extend the classical notion of online tallies to
   shed light on the psychology underlying the rapid emergence of dominant
   political leaders. Predicated on two population-based panel surveys with
   embedded experiments, we demonstrate that citizens (1) store extremely
   durable tallies of candidate personalities in their long-term memory and
   (2) retrieve different tallies depending on the context. In particular,
   we predict and demonstrate that when contexts become more
   conflict-ridden, candidate evaluations rapidly shift from being
   negatively to positively associated with online impressions of candidate
   dominance. Although the notion of online tallies was originally proposed
   as an explanation of why citizens are able to vote for candidates on the
   basis of policy agreement, we demonstrate how the existence of
   context-sensitive online tallies can favor dominant candidates, even if
   the candidate is otherwise unappealing or does not share policy views
   with citizens on key issues.

AB Universities are accused of being left-wing bastions, unwelcoming to
   conservative and right-wing professors. However, we know little about
   the political orientation of professors in comparison to other
   professionals, which would be the right comparison group if we want to
   know whether universities are potentially hostile environments to
   conservatives. Examining culturally and economically oriented political
   orientations in Europe, it is demonstrated that professors are more
   liberal and left-leaning than other professionals. However, there is no
   greater homogeneity of political orientations among the professoriate
   relative to other specific professions, suggesting that there is a
   diversity of opinions which is similar to what professionals would find
   in other occupations. One exception concerns attitudes towards
   immigration, on which professors have more liberal orientations and
   comparatively low residual variance around that more liberal mean.
   Importantly, the difference between professors and other professionals
   is not so clear within graduates from the social sciences, but emerges
   more clearly among graduates with a medical, STEM, economics or law
   degree. An important political cleavage exists between professionals and
   managers, a group of similar social standing.

   Trump's Mexico-related policy tweets and the U.S. dollar/Mexican peso

   peso volatility while his policy views were unknown as well as

AB Marriage rights were extended to same-sex couples in the United States
   in 2015. However, anecdotes of bureaucratic noncompliance (in the form
   of bias or denial of license issuance) raise the possibility that de
   jure marriage equality has not led to equality in practice. We
   investigate this by conducting a nationwide audit experiment of
   local-level marriage license-granting officials in the United States.
   These officials vary in the constituencies they serve, as well as how
   they are selected, allowing us to evaluate long-standing hypotheses
   about bureaucratic responsiveness. Overall, we find no evidence of
   systematic discrimination against same-sex couples-regardless of
   responsiveness measure, institutions, ideology, or prior state legal
   history. We find, however, that among same-sex couples, officials tended
   to be more responsive to lesbian couples. In contrast to evidence in
   other areas of service provision, such as policing and federal
   assistance programs, we find bureaucrats tasked with provision of
   marriage services show little evidence of discrimination.

AB The atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 is one of the most
   powerful global memories. While the literature on global memories has
   greatly expanded in recent decades, Hiroshima remains surprisingly
   understudied. In addressing this lacuna, this paper develops a new
   theoretical prism for the study of global memories. It argues that the
   Hiroshima memory cannot be understood in isolation, but rather as the
   hub in a broader memory complex. This complex is the result of symbolic
   dialogues that connect Hiroshima with such different events, situations,
   and memories as Nanjing, Pearl Harbor, the Cold War, and so on. The
   paper demonstrates how these dialogues have been forged, often in the
   context of substantial controversy. While distinctly sociological in
   orientation, the paper takes its main theoretical inspiration from
   cultural, literary, and history scholars such as Jan and Aleida Assmann,
   Sebastian Conrad, Astrid Erll, Ann Rigney, Michael Rothberg, Aby Warburg

AB This article demonstrates that public opinion on migration "at home" is
   systematically driven by terrorism in other countries. Although there is
   little substantive evidence linking refugees or migrants to most recent
   terror attacks in Europe, news about terrorist attacks can trigger more
   negative views of immigrants. However, the spatial dynamics of this
   process are neglected in existing research. We argue that feelings of
   imminent danger and a more salient perception of migration threats do
   not stop at national borders. The empirical results based on spatial
   econometrics and data on all terrorist attacks in Europe for the
   post-9/11 period support these claims. The effect of terrorism on
   migration concern is strongly present within a country but also diffuses
   across states in Europe. This finding improves our understanding of
   public opinion on migration, as well as the spillover effects of
   terrorism, and it highlights crucial lessons for scholars interested in
   the security implications of population movements.

AB Our knowledge of social trust's drivers in the MENA region is limited
   and there are good reasons to expect that theories based on Western
   countries cannot be copied to the MENA one-to-one. Arguing for a broader
   and at the same time context-sensitive comparative approach, I translate
   the 'societal winners', social capital, and religious beliefs mechanisms
   explaining trust to the MENA context. Moreover, I acknowledge
   intraregional diversity and test how the impact of these factors also
   differs among MENA countries. Empirically, I synchronize 47 surveys from
   15 MENA countries, which provides the broadest and most systematic
   assessment of trust in the MENA to date. The results show that the
   societal-winner mechanism does not hold: employed, higher education and
   wealthier citizens are not more trusting. However, higher-educated
   citizens distrust other citizens more, particularly in the strongest
   autocracies. Religiosity seems pivotal too. Among others,
   service-attending citizens are more trusting, mainly where regimes
   regulate religious affairs. Overall, this study provides insight into
   what shapes generalized social trust in the Middle East and North Africa
   and it underscores that at a comparative level we need to consider
   inter-regional and intra-regional forms of context-dependency were we to
   formulate a broadly applicable theoretical framework of trust's drivers.

AB Despite women's uneven entrances into male-dominated occupations,
   limited scholarship has examined whether and how employers in different
   occupational classes unevenly discriminate against women during early
   hiring practices. This article argues that intersecting gendered and
   classed features of occupations simultaneously shape hiring-related
   practices and generate uneven patterns of inequality. Using data derived
   from comparative white-collar (N = 3,044 resumes) and working-class (N =
   3,258 resumes) correspondence audits and content-coded analyses of more
   than 3,000 job advertisements, the author analyzes early hiring
   practices among employers across two gendered occupational dimensions:
   (1) sex composition (male- or female-dominated jobs) and (2) gender
   stereotyping (masculinized or feminized jobs, based on the attributes
   that employers emphasize in job advertisements). Broadly, findings
   suggest a polarization of early sorting mechanisms in which
   discrimination against female applicants is concentrated in
   male-dominated and masculinized working-class jobs, whereas
   discrimination against male applicants at early job-access points is
   more widespread, occurring in female-dominated and feminized jobs in
   both white-collar and working-class contexts. Interestingly,
   discrimination further compounds for male and female applicants
   depending on the classed context when these occupational dimensions
   align in the same gendered direction (e.g., male-dominated jobs that
   also have masculinized job advertisements). These findings have
   implications for the study of gender and work inequality and indicate
   the importance of a multidimensional approach to hiring-related
   inequality.

AB In academia, women trail men in nearly every major professional reward,
   such as earnings, publications, and funding. Bibliometric studies,
   however, suggest that citations are unique with regard to gender
   inequality: female penalties have been reported, but gender parity or
   even female premiums are routinely documented as well. Two questions
   follow from this puzzle. First, does gender matter for citations in
   sociology and neighboring social science disciplines? No theoretically
   informed study of gender and citations exists for the social science
   core. We begin to fill this gap by analyzing roughly 10,000 publications
   in economics, political science, and sociology. In contrast to many big
   data studies, we estimate the effect of author gender on citations
   alongside other author-, article-, journal-, and (sub)field-level
   predictors. Our results strongly suggest that when male and female
   authors publish articles that are comparably positioned to receive
   citations, their publications do in fact accrue citations at the same
   rate. This finding raises a second question: Why would gender matter
   "everywhere but here"? We hypothesize that the answer is related to the
   mechanisms (e.g., self-selection, biased assessments of commitment) that
   are activated in the context of some professional rewards but not
   citations. We discuss why a null gender finding should not be discarded
   as an anomaly but rather approached as an analytical opportunity.

AB This paper develops and evaluates a theory of status belief transfer,
   the process by which gender status beliefs differentially affect the
   evaluations of products made by men and women. We conduct three online
   experiments to evaluate this theory. In Study 1, we gathered 50 product
   categories from a large online retailer and had participants rate each
   product's association with femininity and masculinity. We find evidence
   of the pervasiveness of gender-typing in product markets. In Studies 2
   and 3, we simulate male-typed and female-typed product markets (craft
   beer and cupcakes, respectively). In the male-typed product market, a
   craft beer described as produced by a woman is evaluated more negatively
   than the same product described as produced by a man. Consistent with
   our predictions, we further find that if the beer is conferred external
   status via an award, the evaluation of the beer made by a woman improves
   by a greater magnitude than the same beer made by a man. In the
   female-typed product market of cupcakes, the producer's gender does not
   affect ratings. Together, the two studies provide evidence of an
   asymmetric negative bias: products made by women are disadvantaged in
   male-typed markets, but products made by men are not disadvantaged in
   female-typed markets. These studies also provide compelling evidence of
   status belief transfer from producers to their products. We draw out the
   implications of these findings and suggest ways that gender biases in
   product markets can be reduced.

AB This study connects two lines of research trend studies on social change
   in housework time and life-course studies on individual- and
   couple-level change in housework time. This novel approach allowed us to
   link the macro-level trend of gender convergence in housework time to
   the micro-level mechanisms underlying it. Using long-running panel data
   (SOEP), we implemented a cohort-sequence design that followed two birth
   cohorts (1960 and 1975) of West German men and women from age 25 until
   age 40. Regression and decomposition methods yielded four central
   findings. First, the gender gap in housework time narrowed by 40 percent
   from the 1960 cohort to the 1975 cohort. Second, women's cohort declines
   in housework time unfolded with age, as the steep life-course increase
   found in the 1960 cohort leveled off in the 1975 cohort. Men's increases
   in housework time were constant across the age range studied. Third, an
   extensive set of time-varying indicators for absolute and relative
   resources, union formation, fertility, and household conditions
   accounted for 77 percent of cohort changes in women's housework time but
   only for 12 percent of changes in men's housework time. In total, the
   covariates considered in our models explained 55 percent of gender
   convergence from the 1960 cohort to the 1975 cohort. Fourth, individual
   age trajectories underlying this trend remained mostly unexplained,
   notably women's shift from a steep rise to a flat line. We conclude that
   life-course factors driving change in housework time may still hold
   potential for further gender convergence.

AB After more than a century of convergence, the economic fortunes of rich
   and poor regions of the United States have diverged dramatically over
   the last 40 years. Roughly a third of the US population now lives in
   metropolitan areas that are substantially richer or poorer than the
   nation as a whole, almost three times the proportion that did in 1980.
   In this paper I use counterfactual simulations based on Census microdata
   to understand the dynamics of regional divergence. I first show that
   regional divergence has primarily resulted from the richest people and
   places pulling away from the rest of the country. I then estimate the
   relative contributions to regional divergence of two major socioeconomic
   trends of recent decades: the sorting of people across metro areas by
   income level and the national rise in income inequality. I show that the
   national rise in income inequality is sufficient on its own to account
   for more than half of the observed divergence across regions, while
   income sorting on its own accounts for less than a quarter. The major
   driver of regional economic divergence is national-level income
   dispersion that has exacerbated preexisting spatial inequalities.

AB Classical and recent accounts of education posit that education
   legitimately, and authoritatively, classifies individuals to positions
   of lower or higher status. However, despite these general theoretical
   claims, empirical evidence that provides an in-depth picture of the
   relationship between educational attainment and social status remains
   scarce. In this paper, based on a dataset of 31 countries (International
   Social Survey Programme), we investigate the extent to which education
   is related to subjective social status, the degree to which this is seen
   as legitimate, and how this relationship varies between countries. We
   contextualize this relationship with the influence of the centrality of
   education in countries (operationalized as the share of higher
   educated). Results showed that education is an important source of
   subjective social status for individuals across all countries, and is
   seen as relatively legitimate and uncontroversial among all educational
   groups. Moreover, among those who perceive education to be more
   important for status, subjective status differences between educational
   groups are larger. Additionally, in countries with larger shares of
   higher educated, educational differences in subjective social status
   correlate more strongly with whether or not people obtained a degree of
   higher (tertiary) education. Lastly, the relationship between education
   and subjective social status in these countries is more independent from
   other sources of status, such as income and gender. It therefore seems
   to be that as higher education becomes more central and widely shared in
   a society, rather than leveling social differences, ironically it also
   becomes more distinctive and diagnostic in distinguishing people along
   group lines.

AB Despite the emerging literature on multigenerational stratification
   beyond two generation models, our understanding of how disadvantages are
   transmitted over multiple generations at the bottom of the socioeconomic
   hierarchy is limited, with the lack of data on the extremely
   disadvantaged. We fill this research gap by investigating the legacy of
   the nobi system, a system by which individuals were treated as property
   and owned by the government or private individuals, upon social mobility
   across four generations. The formal abolition of the nobi system in 1801
   provides an opportunity to assess the extent to which nobi
   great-grandfathers still mattered for great-grandsons' upward mobility,
   more than six decades after the dismantling of the system. Korean
   household registers, which were compiled every three years during
   1765-1894 in two villages on Jeju Island and incorporated a variety of
   individual demographic and social status information, allow us to link
   families across generations. We identify the social status of adult
   males recorded in 1864-94 registers as well as that of their fathers,
   grandfathers, and great-grandfathers. Logistic regression results show
   that the odds of attaining high status were substantially lower for
   adult males whose great-grandfathers were nobis than for those whose
   great-grandfathers held high- or middle-status positions, even after
   controlling for the social statuses of fathers and grandfathers. Despite
   the abolition of the nobi system and the rapid expansion of high-status
   positions throughout the nineteenth century, the upward mobility of
   descendants of nobi great-grandfathers was considerably restricted,
   revealing the continuity of disadvantages over multiple generations.

AB We studied the impact of an individual's family and community background
   on their voting propensity in the 2015 Finnish parliamentary elections
   by employing a sibling design on an individual-level register-based
   dataset. The results showed that a quarter of the total variance in
   voter turnout was shared between siblings. Considering the dichotomous
   nature of the turnout variable, this implies that background has a
   strong effect which is almost comparable to sibling similarity in
   education. Parental socioeconomic position and voting, in turn, are
   equally important factors by explaining one-third of this shared part of
   the likelihood of voting. Mothers and fathers make roughly equal
   contributions. The results suggest that future studies of
   inter-generational effects in political participation, whenever
   possible, should use information from both maternal and paternal
   characteristics and multiple indicators of parental socioeconomic
   position simultaneously. We conclude by underlining that as people
   cannot choose their background, voting propensity is strongly influenced
   by factors beyond an individual's own control, which is problematic for
   the functioning of inclusive democracy and equality of opportunity.

AB Social networks of family and friends are key resources that individuals
   turn to in times of need. When family and friends can provide
   assistance, they constitute a form of social capital that individuals
   may draw on for social support. Although a large body of research has
   examined the use of social support in its own right and as a predictor
   or moderator of other outcomes, few studies have explored differentials
   in access to social support for the general population or how these
   access levels have changed over time. There are many open questions. Is
   access to social support broadly distributed in the population or does
   it differ by demographic subgroups? Have levels of access remained
   constant? We compare levels of access to social support through both
   family and friends across population subgroups and describe the changing
   contours of access to it in the general population. Using repeated
   cross-sectional measurements that we compile from nearly two decades of
   surveys conducted as part of the Survey of Income and Program
   Participation, we expand on a literature that has, to date, focused
   almost exclusively on the use of social support as a predictor of other
   outcomes using non-representative data. This article presents, to our
   knowledge, the first nationally representative study of stratification
   and trends in access to social support for individuals in the United

AB Although family and friends can drain a household's finances by
   requesting personal loans, lenders have proven savvy in how they respond
   to such requests. Beyond identifying the importance of sincerity tests
   for curtailing the pressure to help others in one's social circle, the
   studies of negative social capital do not address why the pressure to
   lend varies according to the dramaturgical performance strategies of the
   benefactors. In other words, how do potential lenders manage to say no
   without saying no? Using interview evidence from clients at the Mission
   Asset Fund in California, we show how individuals engage in obfuscatory
   relational work, performing a self that evades the taboo of greedy
   callousness, while sometimes telling half-truths about not being able to
   help in the way borrowers would like. Unlike the concept of obfuscatory
   relational work, however, we focus on expected transfers that do not
   happen and on unreciprocated gifts that are disguised as loans. The
   lender and recipient are engaged in face-saving obfuscation; but in the
   first case, the lender presents a generous self that is emotionally
   close to the borrower; in the second, the lender helps the recipient of
   the gift maintain face by avoiding an awkward ask, pretending the "loan"
   is expected to be repaid. This paper outlines different strategies of
   obfuscation among adults trying to improve their financial lives and the
   contingencies at play as a ruse is abandoned in favor of a direct
   refusal to lend.

AB This paper proposes that CEO dismissal is a form of penalty that CEOs
   incur for their record of deviation from historically prevailing norms
   of appropriate behavior during performance downturns. To verify this
   argument, I examine CEO dismissal and post-dismissal strategic change in
   large U.S. companies between 1984 and 2007, when the field in which
   these firms were embedded was characterized by the prominence of the
   norms of corporate restructuring for shareholders. My findings are
   three-fold. First, the effect of performance declines on CEO dismissal
   was intensified by the extent to which CEOs held a record of deviation
   from the norms of restructuring i.e., that of increasing assets,
   employees, and unrelated diversification. Second, new CEOs were more
   inclined to engage in restructuring when they took office following the
   dismissal of predecessors with a record of deviation. Finally, those
   patterns of CEO dismissal and post-dismissal restructuring became more
   evident over time as the norms developed. Meanwhile, the findings did
   not apply prior to the shareholder value era. Consequently, this paper
   suggests that institutional norms act as interpretive frameworks that
   enable a board of directors to make sense of performance problems and
   evaluate managerial competence to resolve those problems. Implications
   for the literatures on institutional theory and upper echelon research
   are discussed.

AB payday lenders, check cashers, and other "alternative" financial
   services (AFS) have garnered attention from policymakers and advocates
   for the poor because they are more expensive than traditional banking
   constituting what some call a "Ghetto Tax." This is the first study to
   explore neighborhood-level AFS geography on the national scale.
   Leveraging a dataset comprising the universe of AFS in 2015, I show that
   not only are there substantial differences in AFS presence between white
   and non-white neighborhoods, but that these disparities are largest in
   the most segregated metropolitan areas. This finding supports theories
   that racial segregation creates easily identifiable markets for
   institutions to avoid, target, and exploit. I further show that while
   AFS presence declines with neighborhood income, the gap between black
   and white neighborhoods is widest among high-income neighborhoods,
   reflecting the unique vulnerability of even affluent blacks to
   institutional marginalization. This work documents how the overlapping
   geographies of racial isolation and AFS prevalence shape the very cost
   of money for different racial groups, illustrating the importance of
   institutions transmitting the effects of racial isolation.

AB Legal status is a growing dimension of inequality among immigrants in
   the U.S. Scholars have suggested that the legal status with which
   immigrants enter the country stratifies their short- and long-term
   opportunities for labor market integration. However, much quantitative
   immigration scholarship modeling the relationship between legal status
   and labor market integration treats legal status as static. In reality,
   immigrants change statuses dynamically throughout their lives. This
   article uses a dynamic conceptualization of legal status, as well as
   nationally representative data and regression and propensity score
   weighting techniques, to examine whether five initial legal statuses are
   associated with divergent labor market trajectories even after those
   statuses change. I find that initial legal statuses which I refer to as
   starting points are associated with ordered differences in immigrants'
   occupational positions immediately after immigrants change status to
   lawful permanent residence. These differences persist over time. Five
   years after all immigrants share lawful permanent residence, employment
   visa holders maintain more prestigious jobs; immigrants with family
   reunification and diversity status are in the middle; and immigrants
   with refugee status and undocumented experience have less prestigious
   jobs. This article demonstrates aggregate, longitudinal patterns of
   stratification among a nationally representative sample of permanent
   residents. The findings suggest the importance of modeling legal status
   as a dynamic rather than static category to reflect the continued
   influence of legal status starting points on immigrants' labor market
   integration.

AB The transition to adulthood is increasingly characterized by complex
   paths into the world of work and family, especially for young women. Yet
   how work and family combine to influence stress among young adult women
   is not well understood. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study
   of Adolescent to Adult Health, we leverage new extensions to latent
   class analysis (LCA) to identify common combinations of work and family
   circumstances among young adult women, their earlier life and
   contemporaneous correlates, and associations with two stress measures: a
   multi-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Epstein Barr Viral (EBV)
   antibody titers, a well-validated biomarker of stress-related immunity
   impairments. We identify seven different common combinations of latent
   work family combinations among young adult women ranging from
   well-compensated professional workers with and without children, mothers
   without paid employment, and delayed transitions to work and family.
   Completing a college degree was associated with a higher likelihood of
   membership in classes marked by professional work irrespective of
   motherhood, while being raised in a community with greater female labor
   opportunities was generally associated with membership in child-free
   classes. Mothers and child-free women in "pink-collar" work with low
   wages and decision-marking freedom reported higher stress compared to
   women in "white-collar" work with higher wages and decision-making
   freedom. These differences are mostly attenuated following adjustments
   for poverty-related stressors and work family conflict. While prior work
   has emphasized the health benefits for women of combining work and
   family, our research suggests these benefits may be limited to women of
   higher socioeconomic status with flexible, well-compensated jobs.

AB Public support for environmental protection has evinced declines in
   recent years that are widely attributed to growing antipathy among
   self-identified Republicans. Fractures in what was long considered broad
   and enduring support for the environment in the United States have
   called attention to the broader socio-political context in which
   individual opinion on the environment is formed, and especially the role
   of political parties and their leaders in shaping opinion. Empirical
   analyses of environmental support, however, remain strongly focused on
   individual-level correlates of support. We apply recent methodological
   advances in age-period-cohort models to scrutinize changes in Americans'
   willingness to pay more for environmental protection between 1973 and
   2014. Analyses distinguish the importance of individual traits, such as
   political identification, from cohort and especially period-based
   fluctuations that result from changing economic and political
   conditions. Individual-level covariate results are reflective of
   previous research on environmental opinion (e.g., age is negatively and
   education positively associated with environmental support). We further
   find that political context across time periods matters as much as, and
   interacts with, individual political affiliation to influence support
   for the environment. Americans of all political stripes demonstrate
   decreases in support for environmental spending during Democratic
   presidential administrations and during difficult economic times.
   Declines during Democratic presidencies are especially pronounced among
   Republicans. Analyses also highlight parallels between the high levels
   of political polarization in environmental support found at the end of
   the Obama Presidency and the end of the Carter era.

AB Grandparents are often considered as providing important resources in
   times of family crisis. Little is known, however, about the influence of
   grandparents on the well-being of grandchildren after parental divorce.
   This article investigates the association between the quality of
   relationships with grandparents and grandchildren's subjective
   well-being. Using data from the study 'Divorce in Flanders', the authors
   compare 567 grandchildren with divorced and 238 with married parents
   regarding four indicators of subjective well-being (life satisfaction,
   self-esteem, mastery, and depressive feelings) and also examine
   variation within the group with divorced parents. Results show that the
   strength of grandchild-grandparent relationships is positively
   associated with grandchildren's subjective well-being and that having a
   very good relationship with a grandparent matters even more for
   grandchildren whose parents have divorced. Moreover, grandchildren who
   experience frequent conflicts between divorced parents seem to benefit
   most from close grandparent relationships.

AB Most elderly care continues to be delivered informally within families.
   Yet we still lack a thorough understanding of how care responsibilities
   are shared across both family ties and generations. We explore the
   gender dimension of caregiving in the distribution of elderly care
   between couple members (care provided to parents and parents-in-law and
   to children or grandchildren) and its associations with siblings' sex
   composition in a range of European countries. Using SHARE data and
   multinomial multilevel models, we test how responsibility for elderly
   care is shared across children and mediated by their partners and their
   siblings' sex composition as well as how it is combined with other
   downward care responsibilities, towards children and grandchildren.
   Results confirm the very gendered nature of elderly care. But who do men
   shift elderly care responsibilities to? We find that elderly care is
   more likely shifted to sisters than brothers, especially when caregiving
   becomes intense. We also find that the lower contribution by sons does
   not seem to prompt transfers of care responsibilities to their female
   partners within couples. Finally, although upward and downward caring
   responsibilities might compete, we find that individuals who are more
   inclined to provide care tend to do so in both directions.

AB The interdependence between partners raises considerable interest in the
   sociology of life course, work, and families. Partner influences play a
   particularly important role in the work domain, because each partner's
   work decisions have profound effects on the couple as a whole. In
   contrast to previous research, this article pays detailed attention to
   the role a partner plays in workers' labour market decisions by
   analysing the case of early retirement decisions. We hypothesized that
   partners' preferences for older workers' retirement originate from
   altruism and self-interest. Moreover, we expected that partners
   influence older workers' early retirement behaviour via persuasion and
   pressure. To adequately estimate partners' and workers' preferences for
   the worker's retirement, we used an instrumental variable approach. This
   was possible because we collected multi-actor longitudinal data from a
   large representative sample of older workers and their partners in the
   Netherlands. The results support that spousal preferences originate in
   altruism and self-interest and that partners influence workers through
   persuasion and pressure. Gender differences in origins and mechanisms of
   partner influence are also discussed.

AB This paper analyses how and when men and women devote their extra time
   to childcare and housework by exploiting an exogenous shock in
   scheduling: the partial implementation of the 35-hour work-week reform
   in France. Using propensity score matching and the most recent time use
   survey (INSEE, 2010), we show that time reallocations differ by gender
   and day of the week. While men dedicate their extra time to performing
   more housework on weekdays in the form of mainly time-flexible tasks
   such as repairs or shopping, they do less on weekends. This shift from
   weekends to weekdays is not observed for women who perform day-to-day
   tasks that are less transferable. Women spend more time on childcare and
   reduce multitasking. Overall, task specialization by gender is more
   pronounced, and this gendered use of similar extra time illustrates that
   time allocation is not only a question of time availability. In
   particular, men and women 'do gender' at weekends, when performing tasks
   is more visible to others.

AB While existing research highlights the feminized and devalued nature of
   care work, the relationship between care work and job satisfaction has
   not yet been tested cross-nationally. England (2005) outlines two
   theoretical frameworks that guide our thinking about this potential
   relationship: the Prisoner of Love framework suggests that,
   notwithstanding the explicit and implicit costs of care work, the
   intrinsic benefits of caring provide 'psychic income' and lead to
   greater job satisfaction; while the Commodification of Emotion framework
   suggests, instead, that care work generates additional stress and/or
   alienation for the worker, thereby resulting in lower job satisfaction.
   This article empirically tests this relationship in 18 countries using
   European Social Survey data and incorporating national-level factors.
   The results provide support for the Prisoner of Love framework, with
   variation based on the degree of professionalization. Although we find
   broad evidence of a care work-job satisfaction bonus, non-professional
   care workers experience a substantively larger bonus than their
   paraprofessional and professional counterparts. However, national-level
   economic inequality is also found to play a role in this relationship,
   with higher inequality amplifying the care work bonus at all levels of
   professionalization.

AB This study contributes to the research on motherhood penalties by
   investigating based on German longitudinal register data whether mothers
   take longer to search for a job than childless women. We develop a
   unique research design to test the theory of statistical discrimination
   as well as the theory of status-based discrimination. We use
   establishment closures as a starting point that creates equal conditions
   for all previously employed women. Following a subsequent coarsened
   exact matching approach, we investigate the job search length of almost
   3,000 comparable full-time working childless women and mothers from
   almost 700 establishments by applying event history techniques. Even
   after extensive robustness checks that back up the main findings, we can
   show that mothers have lower transition rates to re-employment than
   childless women. When including additional information, such as higher
   age of the youngest child or shorter parental leave durations, both of
   which serve as indicators of higher labour market attachment, we find
   reduced differences and buffering effects on the motherhood penalty.

AB A considerable portion of European citizens are in favour of limited or
   conditional access for migrants to welfare provisions. Previous studies
   found that this welfare chauvinism is stronger among citizens with less
   favourable economic positions. This study seeks to explain the
   relationship between economic risk, both objective and subjective, and
   welfare chauvinism by looking at two distinct mechanisms: the
   traditional economic explanation of economic egalitarianism and the
   cultural explanation of ethnic threat. Given the lack of longitudinal
   studies, we also examine whether changes in economic risk, economic
   egalitarianism and threat can explain changes in welfare chauvinism over
   time. Using a four-wave panel-study (2013-2015) collected in Great
   Britain and the Netherlands, these relationships were studied both
   cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The longitudinal mediation model
   was tested by making use of parallel process latent growth curve
   modelling. In both Great Britain and the Netherlands, economic
   egalitarianism and ethnic threat explained the link between economic
   risk and welfare chauvinism. Furthermore, in both countries, an increase
   over time in perceptions of ethnic threat was found to be the driving
   force behind an increase in welfare chauvinism, irrespective of changes
   in economic egalitarianism.

AB The purpose of our study is to investigate the role of wealth in broader
   stratification processes. Based on unique data from Norwegian tax
   registers, we address questions about the association between class
   origin, wealth transfers, and wealth accumulation among young adults. We
   show that is more common to receive transfers in the higher than in the
   lower social classes, and that those originating in the economic upper
   class, i.e. large proprietors, owners, of single enterprises as well as
   investors with diversified portfolios, and top managers and directors,
   are especially likely to receive transfers, as well as especially large
   inter vivos gifts. As young adults, those with upper-class origins, and
   especially origins in the economic upper class, accumulate more wealth
   than those with origins in classes lower in the social hierarchy. In all
   social classes, those who have received wealth transfers accumulate most
   wealth. We argue that transferring wealth indeed appears as robust and
   efficient mobility or reproduction strategy.

   parental transfers by government programs is sizable and cannot be

   that the value of flexibility can be measured as deriving from time
   variation in the drivers' reservation wage. Measuring time variation in
   drivers' reservation wages allows us to estimate the surplus and labor
   supply implications of Uber relative to alternative, less-flexible work

   United States to document the degree of educational assortative mating,
   how it evolves over time, and the extent to which it differs between
   countries. This descriptive analysis motivates and guides a
   decomposition analysis in which we quantify the contribution of various
   factors to the distribution of household income. We find that
   assortative mating accounts for a nonnegligible part of the
   cross-sectional inequality in household income in each country. However,
   changes in assortative mating over time barely move the time trends in
   household income inequality.

AB We develop frameworks for welfare analysis of Medicaid and apply them to
   the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment. Across different approaches, we
   estimate low-income uninsured adults' willingness to pay for Medicaid
   between $0.5 and $1.2 per dollar of the resource cost of providing
   Medicaid; estimates of the expected transfer Medicaid provides to
   recipients are relatively stable across approaches, but estimates of its
   additional value from risk protection are more variable. We also
   estimate that the resource cost of providing Medicaid to an additional
   recipient is only 40 percent of Medicaid's total cost; 60 percent of
   Medicaid spending is a transfer to providers of uncompensated care for
   the low-income uninsured.

   Our framework allows us to characterize matching equilibrium in a
   flexible way that includes as special cases fully and nontransferable
   utility models, collective models, and settings with taxes on transfers.
   We allow for the introduction of a general class of additive unobserved
   heterogeneity on agents' preferences. We show existence and uniqueness
   of an equilibrium under minimal assumptions. We provide two algorithms
   to compute the equilibrium in our model. We then show that the
   associated log likelihood has a simple expression and compute its

AB We analyze the competitive effects of mergers in markets with buyer
   power. Using mechanism design arguments, we show that without cost
   synergies, mergers harm buyers, regardless of buyer power. However,
   buyer power mitigates the harm to a buyer from a merger of symmetric
   suppliers. With buyer power, a merger increases incentives for entry,
   increases investment incentives for rivals, and can increase investment
   incentives for merging parties. Because buyer power reduces the
   profitability of a merger, it increases the profitability of perfect
   collusion relative to a merger. Cost synergies can eliminate merger harm
   but also render otherwise profitable mergers unprofitable.

   multiple-marginalization problem, but unlike mergers, they do not stifle
   price competition in case of substitutes or facilitate foreclosure in
   case of complements. The paper first demonstrates this for nonrepeated
   interaction and general demand and cost functions. It then shows that
   allowing price caps has no impact on investment and entry in case of
   substitutes. Under more restrictive assumptions, the paper finally
   generalizes the insights to repeated price interaction, analyzing

   the original MTE, the redefined MTE can be used as a building block for
   constructing standard causal estimands. The weights associated with the

   Moreover, the redefined MTE immediately reveals treatment effect
   heterogeneity among individuals at the margin of treatment, enabling us
   to evaluate a wide range of policy effects.

AB Women's opportunities have been profoundly altered over the past century
   by reductions in the social and structural constraints that limit
   women's educational attainment. Do social constraints manifest as a
   suppressing influence on genetic indicators of potential, and if so, did
   equalizing opportunity mean equalizing the role of genetics? We address
   this with three cohort studies: the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS;
   birth years 1939 to 1940), the Health and Retirement Study, and the
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health; birth
   years 1975 to 1982). These studies include a "polygenic score" for
   educational attainment, providing a novel opportunity to explore this
   question. We find that within the WLS cohort, the relationship between
   genetics and educational outcomes is weaker for women than for men.
   However, as opportunities changed in the 1970s and 1980s, and many
   middle-aged women went back to school, the relationship between genetic
   factors and education strengthened for women as they aged. Furthermore,
   utilizing the HRS and Add Health, we find that as constraints limiting
   women's educational attainment declined, gender differences in the
   relationship between genetics and educational outcomes weakened. We
   demonstrate that genetic influence must be understood through the lens
   of historical change, the life course, and social structures like
   gender.

AB Perception of Western governments' hostility to Islam is one of the
   indicating features of Islamic fundamentalism and, in some cases, is
   serving as a pull to join extremist groups. In this paper, using data
   from two waves of a cross-national survey, we investigate what affects
   European Muslims' opinions about Western governments. We find that
   residential segregation is associated with perceived hostility of
   Western governments to Islam. Further, we find that Muslims living in
   segregated neighbourhoods and enclaves have a higher probability of
   believing that Western governments are hostile to Islam. National
   origins of Muslim immigrants have a significant impact, with people from
   African countries measuring less perceived hostility than others. We
   also find that education is associated with perceived hostility of
   Western governments to Islam in a non-linear way. People with the
   highest and lowest levels of education tend to be less likely to believe
   that Western governments are hostile to Islam, relative to people with
   mid-level education. This non-linear effect is best explained by
   education's differential effects on perceptions of key world events.
   During the time between 2011 - before ISIS's announcement of its
   Caliphate in Iraq and Syria - and 2013, subsequent to that announcement,
   we see a sharp decrease in perception of Western governments' hostility
   to Islam, particularly among more educated European Muslims. We make the
   case that this decrease can be attributed, in some ways, to the
   emergence of ISIS. We discuss our findings in terms of theoretical and
   policy implications.

   sexual stigma and makes an important contribution to critiques of the
   individualized frameworks that have dominated much of the literature on
   stigma to date, through a critical analysis of sexual stigma as a
   collective process at different scales and locations. Second, using
   empirical data from a qualitative study of post-trafficking experiences
   of women in Nepal as a case study to develop theoretical understandings
   of the production of stigma, it explores modalities of sexualized stigma
   encountered on return from trafficking situations. Within the
   trafficking literature there has been very little attention to what
   happens after trafficking. This article addresses this gap in focusing
   on lives post-trafficking and, in addition, contributes to the limited
   research on trafficking in Nepal.

AB Foreign investment in Africa's mineral resources has increased
   dramatically. This paper addresses three questions raised by this trend:
   do commercial mining investments increase the likelihood of social or
   armed conflict? If so, when are these disputes most prevalent? And,
   finally, what mechanisms help explain these conflicts? I show, first,
   that mining has contrasting effects on social and armed conflict: while
   the probability of protests or riots increases (roughly doubling) after
   mining starts, there is no increase in rebel activity. Second, I show
   that the probability of social conflict rises with plausibly exogenous
   increases in world commodity prices. Finally, I compile additional
   geo-spatial and survey data to explore potential mechanisms, including
   reporting bias, environmental harm, in-migration, inequality, and
   governance. Finding little evidence consistent with these accounts, I
   develop an explanation related to incomplete informationa common cause
   of conflict in industrial and international relations. This mechanism
   rationalizes why mining induces protest, why these conflicts are
   exacerbated by rising prices, and why transparency dampens the
   relationship between prices and protest.

AB Field experiments represent the gold standard for determining whether
   discrimination occurs. Britain has a long and distinguished history of
   field experiments of racial discrimination in the labour market, with
   pioneering studies dating back to 1967 and 1969. This article reviews
   all the published reports of these and subsequent British field
   experiments of racial discrimination in the labour market, including new
   results from a 2016/17 field experiment. The article finds enduring
   contours of racial discrimination in Britain. Firstly, there is an
   enduring pattern of modest discrimination against white minorities of
   European heritage in contrast to much greater risks of discrimination
   faced by the main non-white groups, suggesting a strong racial component
   to discrimination. Secondly, while there is some uncertainty about the
   magnitude of the risks facing applicants with Chinese and Indian names,
   the black Caribbean, black African and Pakistani groups all face
   substantial and very similar risks of discrimination. Thirdly, there is
   no significant diminution in risks of discrimination over time either
   for Caribbeans or for South Asians as a whole. These results are broadly
   in line with those from the ethnic penalties literature, suggesting that
   discrimination is likely to be a major factor explaining the
   disproportionately and enduringly high unemployment rates of ethnic
   minorities.

AB This article uses ethnographic data to engage a critical reflection on
   the tension between individual responsibility for the environment and
   inequality. While research has shown that the majority of sustainable
   consumers are middle and upper class, educated and white individuals,
   the study explores how the ethical injunction to ecological
   sustainability is being introduced to lower-income neighbourhoods in
   France. It draws on the observation of a national programme which aims
   at supporting inhabitants of public housing estates in the process of
   greening their lifestyle in order to fight climate change and fuel
   poverty. The paper analyses how environmental responsibilization is
   specific in that it calls upon a responsibility towards others, towards
   the common good. Using the Foucauldian concept of 'subjectivation', it
   describes and analyses the moral work implied by such behaviour change
   programmes. It demonstrates that a negative representation of poor
   households and a moral framing of the responsibility for the environment
   lead to a moralization of their lifestyle under the heading of
   'eco-friendly behaviours'. A paradoxical result of such endeavours is
   that the social group with the least impactful lifestyle on the
   environment is the one which is moralized in the most intrusive and
   resolute manner. The article shows, however, that the tenants manage to
   resist the normalizing discourse on sustainable living, for reasons
   which are not anti-environmentalist. This piece thus provides
   interesting results for sustainability studies as well as for the
   sociology of the regulation of underprivileged neighbourhoods.

AB In recent times there has been a proliferation of scholarship exploring
   'mixedness' and mixed-race people. This is evidenced by the emergence of
   Critical Mixed Race Studies (CMRS) as a distinct field of academic
   inquiry. However, despite the growth of CMRS, there remains a scarcity
   of scholarship that considers mixed-race experiences from a
   disaggregated, intersectional perspective. Where CMRS has been attentive
   to the intersection of gender, the focus has largely been on women and
   femininity. By way of a response, in this article I draw upon data from
   semi-structured interviews with Black mixed-race men in the UK and the
   US in order to explore how Black mixed-race men negotiate their raced
   and gendered identities, particularly in the context of schooling.
   Drawing upon George Yancy's (2017) theorizations of the Black monster, I
   argue that a sense of double consciousness (and even multiple
   consciousness) means Black mixed-race men are acutely aware of how the
   white gaze threatens to fragment and erase them. Yet rather than being
   passive victims of racism, I show that, through hybridity, the
   imposition of the Black monster stereotype is something that Black
   mixed-race men are able to resist, modify and manipulate for their own
   ends.

   how parent's social class, religion, religiosity, race and ethnicity,
   and education are related to the qualities they would like their
   children to have. Our rank-ordered regression models show that parents
   in service class occupations place significantly more importance on
   'thinking for self' than 'obey parents' compared to those in routine

   strong. Parenting values also differ by parental racial and ethnic

AB In this paper, we intend to deconstruct the term 'tribalism' as a
   colonial category, which figures as a prominent concept in social
   studies on Kurds as well as the Middle East at large. Blithely used,
   tribalism has occupied a central place, especially in the existing
   scholarship on Kurdistan. Some earlier anthropological works have gone
   so far as to regard tribalism as the 'DNA' of Middle Eastern people.
   Drawing on recent studies on Latin America, Africa and Central Asia, we
   argue that the use of tribalism as if it is the natural constitution of
   Kurdish society has caused a significant misrepresentation and
   oversimplification of socio-political life in Kurdistan as well as the
   broader Middle East. In a way, the existing body of scholarship on this
   region has reproduced statist-nationalist discourses at the expense of
   dominated communities (e.g., Kurds). The historical context of both
   colonial powers and nation-states 'combating tribes and tribalism'
   coincided with the emergence of the discourse of racial biopolitics.
   Thus, the use of the term tribalism to define certain nations or ethnic
   groups should not be viewed as merely an application of
   socio-anthropological categories. Hence, we argue that the ethical
   aspects and implications of the use of tribalism by both colonial powers
   and later by nation-states to define certain ethnic groups must not be
   overlooked.

AB Lighting is increasingly recognized as a significant social intervention
   by both lighting professionals and academic social scientists. However,
   what counts as 'the social' is diverse and contested, with consequences
   for what kind of 'social' is performed or invented. Based on a long-term
   research programme, we argue that collaboration between sociologists and
   lighting professionals requires negotiating discourses and practices of
   'the social'. This paper explores the quality and kinds of spaces made
   for 'the social' in professional practices and academic collaborations,
   focusing on two case studies of urban lighting that demonstrate how the
   space of 'the social' is constrained and impoverished by an
   institutionalized division between technical and aesthetic lighting. We
   consider the potential role of sociologists in making more productive
   spaces for 'the social' in urban design, as part of the central
   sociological task of 'inventing the social' (Marres, Guggenheim and
   Wilkie 2018) in the process of studying it.

AB In this article, I draw on data derived from an ethnographic field study
   of covert policing in the United Kingdom to demonstrate that the
   deployment of covert surveillance has become normalized, both in
   policing thought and operational practice. In a break with earlier
   patterns, the methods of covert surveillance are used extensively and
   are no longer regarded as a tactic of last resort. Covert policing is
   well anchored within organizational arrangements, empowered by a series
   of internal rationales mobilized to justify the expansion of covert
   tactics over and above more traditional, overt forms. The building of
   intrusive and exceptional policing practices within mundane contexts, I
   argue, is one of the ways the police have adapted to a broader policing
   environment characterized by public scepticism and distrust. Policing
   relies on the invisibility and low profile that comes with covert work,
   in order to govern contemporary concerns of crime and insecurity without
   the conflicts which can accompany - and trouble - overt policing
   practices. As mainstream policing becomes an increasingly extroverted
   enterprise, introverted forms of policing have come to the fore.

AB Social networking is a digital phenomenon embraced by billions
   worldwide. Use of online social platforms has the potential to generate
   a number of benefits including to well-being from enhanced social
   connectedness and social capital accumulation, but is also associated
   with several negative behaviours and impacts. Employing a life-course
   perspective, this paper explores social networking use and its
   relationship with measures of subjective well-being. Large-scale UK
   panel data from wave 3 (2011-12) and 6 (2014-15) of Understanding
   Society reveals that social network users are on average younger, aged
   under 25, but that rising use is reported across the life-course
   including into old age. Probit, multinomial logistic, and ANCOVA and
   change-score estimations reveal that membership, and greater use, of
   social networks is associated with higher levels of overall life
   satisfaction. However, heavy use of social networking sites has negative
   impacts, reflected in reductions in subjective well-being.
   Socio-economic disadvantage may drive these impacts among young (in
   education), unemployed and economically inactive heavy SNS users.

AB States with large markets routinely compete with one another to shield
   domestic regulatory policies from global pressure, export their rules to
   other jurisdictions, and provide their firms with competitive
   advantages. Most arguments about market power tend to operationalize the
   concept in economic terms. In this paper, we argue that a state's
   ability to leverage or block these adjustment pressures is not only
   conditioned by their relative economic position but also by the
   political institutions that govern their markets. Specifically, we
   expect that where a state chooses to draw jurisdictional boundaries over
   markets directly shapes its global influence. When a state expands its
   jurisdiction, harmonizing rules across otherwise distinct subnational or
   national markets, for example, it can curtail a rival's authority. We
   test the theory by assessing how changes in internal governance within
   the European Union altered firm behavior in response to US
   extraterritorial pressure. Empirically, we examine foreign firm
   delisting decisions from US stock markets after the adoption of the
   Sarbanes-Oxley accounting legislation. The act, which included an
   exogenous compliance shock, follows the harmonization of stock market
   governance across various European jurisdictions. Econometric analysis
   of firm-level data illustrates that EU-based companies, which benefited
   from jurisdictional expansion, were substantially more likely to leave
   the American market and avoid adjustment pressures. Our findings
   contribute to debates on the role of political institutions in economic
   statecraft and suggest the conditions under which future regulatory
   conflicts will arise between status quo and rising economic powers.

AB A large literature has established that the International Monetary Fund
   (IMF) is heavily politicized. We argue that this politicization has
   important consequences for international reserve accumulation and
   financial crises. The IMF generates moral hazard asymmetrically,
   reducing the expected costs of risky lending and policies for states
   that are politically influential vis-a-vis the institution. Using a
   panel data set covering 1980 to 2010, we show that proxies for political
   influence over the IMF are associated with outcomes indicative of moral
   hazard: lower international reserves and more frequent financial crises.
   We support our causal claims by applying the synthetic control method to
   Taiwan, which was expelled from the IMF in 1980. Consistent with our
   predictions, Taiwan's expulsion led to a sharp increase in precautionary
   international reserves and exceptionally conservative financial
   policies.

AB Are UN peacekeepers effective in protecting civilians from violence?
   Existing studies examine this issue at the country level, thereby making
   it difficult to isolate the effect of peacekeepers and to assess the
   actual mechanism at work. We provide the first comprehensive evaluation
   of UN peacekeeping success in protecting civilians at the subnational
   level. We argue that peacekeepers through their sizable local presence
   can increase the political and military costs for warring actors to
   engage in civilian targeting. Since peacekeepers' access to civilian
   populations rests on government consent, peacekeepers will primarily be
   effective in imposing these costs on rebel groups, but less so for
   government actors. To test these conjectures we combine new monthly data
   on the location of peacekeepers with data on the location and timing of
   civilian killings in Africa. Our findings suggest that local
   peacekeeping presence enhances the effectiveness of civilian protection
   against rebel abuse, but that UN peacekeeping struggles to protect
   civilians from government forces.

AB Why do armies sometimes surrender to the enemy and sometimes fight to
   the bitter end? Existing research has highlighted the importance of
   battlefield resolve for the onset, conduct, and outcome of war, but has
   left these life-and-death decisions mostly unexplained. We know little
   about why battle-level surrender occurs, and why it stops. In this
   paper, we argue that surrender emerges from a collective-action problem:
   success in battle requires that soldiers choose to fight as a unit
   rather than flee, but individual decisions to fight depend on whether
   soldiers expect their comrades to do the same. Surrender becomes
   contagious across battles because soldiers take cues from what other
   soldiers did when they were in a similar position. Where no recent
   precedent exists, mass surrender is unlikely. We find empirical support
   for this claim using a new data set of conventional battles in all
   interstate wars from 1939 to 2011. These findings advance our
   understanding of battlefield resolve, with broader implications for the
   design of political-military institutions and decisions to initiate,
   continue, and terminate war.

AB y Bureaucracies with field operations that cannot be easily supervised
   and monitored by managers are caught between two sources of dysfunction
   that may harm performance. The first source of dysfunction is
   straightforward: field workers can use operating slack and asymmetric
   information to their own advantage, thwarting an organization's
   objectives. The second source of dysfunction is often overlooked:
   attempts to limit workers' autonomy may have deleterious effects,
   curbing agents' ability to respond efficaciously to the environment. I
   find that the parliaments and executive boards to whom International
   Development Organizations (IDOs) are accountable differentially
   constrain IDO organizational autonomy, which in turn affects
   management's control of field agents. Tight management control of field
   agents has negative effects, particularly in more unpredictable
   environments. Attempts by politicians to constrain organizations in an
   effort to improve performance can sometimes be self-undermining, having
   net effects opposite those intended.

AB In the past few years the Western world has witnessed a rise in the
   popularity of right-wing political discourse promoting nationalistic and
   exclusionary world views. While in many countries such rhetoric has
   surfaced in mainstream politics only recently, in Israel, right-wing
   ideology has been popular for almost two decades. Explanations for this
   phenomenon focus on Israeli citizens' attitudinal change in the face of
   exposure to terrorism but largely do not account for why such ideas
   remain popular over the long term, even after violence subsides. In this
   study I examine whether the long-lasting prominence of right-wing
   nationalistic politics in Israel is linked to the perpetuation of
   right-wing ideology in popular media. Analyzing the content of more than
   70,000 published books, I find that content related to the political
   right has increased in Israeli books after periods of terrorism, a
   change that has become more pronounced over the years.

AB We present a two-stage approach to civil conflict analysis. Unlike
   conventional approaches that focus only on armed conflict and treat all
   other cases as at peace, we first distinguish cases with and without
   contested incompatibilities (Stage 1) and then whether or not contested
   incompatibilities escalate to armed conflict (Stage 2). This allows us
   to analyze factors that relate to conflict origination (onset of
   incompatibilities) and factors that predict conflict militarization
   (onset of armed violence). Using new data on incompatibilities and armed
   conflict, we replicate and extend three prior studies of violent civil
   conflict, reformulated as a two-stage process, considering different
   estimation procedures and potential selection problems. We find that the
   group-based horizontal political inequalities highlighted in research on
   violent civil conflict clearly relate to conflict origination but have
   no clear association with militarization, whereas other features
   emphasized as shaping the risk of civil war, such as refugee flows and
   soft state power, predict militarization but not incompatibilities. A
   two-stage approach to conflict analysis can help advance theories of
   civil conflict, assess alternative mechanisms through which explanatory
   variables are thought to influence conflict, and guide new
   data-collection efforts.

AB This article seeks to develop our understanding of the agency of
   vulnerable groups who at first sight may not seem to have much agency in
   their lives. It explores the co-constructed nature of agency in three
   Danish homeless shelters. Unlike earlier interview-based studies, our
   research is based on naturalistic data drawn from 23 video-recorded
   placement meetings. Using concepts from Goffman, we examine how versions
   of the neediness and worthiness of homeless people are negotiated
   verbally and bodily between staff and clients. We find that homeless
   people have to juggle two partly contradictory roles when they are given
   or take the roles of either a (active) citizen or a (passive) client.
   Clientship is actively negotiated by both parties and demonstrates the
   agency of homeless people: they can collaborate with (as clients) or
   challenge (as citizens) the staff's attempts to formulate solutions to
   their troubles. We further examine how the professional ideology of
   client centredness affects the meeting between the two parties. However,
   we show that, like any discourse, client centredness has no intrinsic
   meaning and is played out by actors in very different ways. In work with
   the homeless, the discourse of client centredness is related to
   discourses of 'neediness', 'worthiness' and 'value for money' that
   define agency in different ways and make three different client
   positions available: the resolute client, the acquiescent client and the
   passive client.

AB The current paper examines terrorism as a special form of moralistic
   violence, with several key features that distinguish such behaviour from
   other types of violence. The theory of lethal moralism highlights the
   importance of social polarization, characterized by vast differences in
   social space and inequality between adversaries as crucial to explaining
   deadly terrorist attacks. Where the differences are more permanent or
   chronic - and the groups in question define and justify their existence
   specifically in contradistinction to 'other' groups - then the
   polarization intensifies and attacks tend to be more lethal. In
   contrast, groups that appeal to broader audiences or the general public
   as potential allies more often use non-lethal terrorism to their
   strategic advantage. The study examines the United States and the United
   Kingdom to classify each of more than 8,000 attacks between 1970 and
   2017 in terms of their ideological orientations. The evidence highlights
   the arc of terrorism in relation to different types of groups, as well
   as confirms the more lethal nature of terrorism linked especially to
   radical Islam, right-wing religious extremists, hate groups,
   ethno-nationalist sectarian violence, and anti-government anarchists.
   Yet apart from the extensive use of terrorism associated with 'The
   Troubles' in Northern Ireland, the majority of terrorist attacks in the
   US and the UK have not produced deaths. Most terrorism instead has been
   perpetrated by groups aiming to rally support for a general cause and
   has been far less deadly on balance. The implications of these findings
   are discussed with a view toward developing more powerful explanatory
   models that focus on the socio-cultural contexts and justification
   frameworks that inspire extremism and the use of lethal moralism to
   settle disputes.

AB While description is a valuable aspect of meaningful sociological work,
   this paper takes issue with Mike Savage's argument that the social
   sciences, and sociology in particular, should seek to prioritize
   description over practices of explanation and analysis, and attention to
   questions of causality. The aim of this paper is not to take issue with
   descriptive forms of sociology in themselves, but to argue that the
   answer to the problems identified by Savage and Burrows in their
   landmark paper "The Coming Crisis of Empirical Sociology" is not to
   follow commercial forms of research by prioritizing practices of
   description and classification at the cost of asking fundamental
   questions about the "why?" and the "how?" of social life and politics.
   Rather, this paper argues that it is imperative that sociology does not
   simply describe inequalities of different types, but questions,
   explains, and analyses the structures and mechanisms through which they
   are created, reproduced, and sustained. The argument will be developed
   in three stages. First, this paper will restate the main points of
   Savage's call for descriptive sociology; second, it will address his
   critique of "epochalist thinking" and subsequent opposition to the idea
   of neoliberalism; and third, it will respond to his use of Thomas
   Piketty's work as a model for developing sociological descriptions of
   class and inequality.

   from mass surveys of the electorate in the postwar period or from
   aggregate electoral data. Using individual elector-level panel data from
   nineteenth-century United Kingdom poll books, we reassess the
   development of a party centered electorate. We show that (a) the
   electorate was party-centered by the time of the extension of the
   franchise in 1867, (b) a decline in candidate-centered voting is largely
   attributable to changes in the behavior of the working class, and (c)
   the enfranchised working class aligned with the Liberal left. This early
   alignment of the working class with the left cannot entirely be
   explained by a decrease in vote buying. The evidence suggests instead
   that the alignment was based on the programmatic appeal of the Liberals.

   party missed the 5% threshold in a German state by a mere vote in 2007,
   but the Constitutional Court ordered a revote in a single precinct over
   potential election fraud. After a one-sided campaign focusing on law and
   order, the party's vote share increased more than sixfold. By comparing
   the precinct with its direct surroundings, the study shows that the
   revote campaign had long-lasting effects on vote choice and broader
   security-sensitive behavior. Residents in the revote precinct installed
   more warning signs on their property to deter burglars. They were not
   more supportive of right-wing attitudes but were more likely to believe
   that election fraud reoccurred. Based on habitual-voting and social-norm
   theories, the study suggests that persuasion could be durable if
   candidates provide an unchallenged interpretation of political events.

   compromise, more realistic about what can be achieved, and less prone to
   simplistic solutions. The results of conjoint experiments with party
   profiles show that while an ideological leaning carries no cost, any
   appreciably left- or right-wing position eroded a party's perceived
   competence among a representative sample of around 2,000 British
   citizens. This effect holds when controlling for respondents'
   ideological proximity to the party in question, and it looks to operate

AB This article describes how issue specialization through deliberative
   institutions called "issue publics" can improve the quality of
   democratic decision making. Issue specialization improves decisions by
   instantiating a cognitive division of labor among the mass public, which
   creates efficiencies in decision making and grants large groups of
   average citizens a scalable advantage over small groups of even the
   smartest and most capable individuals. Issue specialization further
   improves decisions by capturing issue-specific information,
   concentrating it within the specialized deliberative enclaves of issue
   publics, and refining citizens' issue preferences. These advantages are
   brought to bear in wider democratic politics and policy through
   information shortcuts and through the specialized electoral incentives
   of representatives. The article responds to concerns about political
   ignorance, polarization/partisanship, rent seeking, and socioeconomic
   bias and argues that issue specialization can provide a valuable brake
   to polarization yet needs institutional supplementation to engage

   effectiveness using a single metric-whether the bills a member sponsors
   progress through the legislative process. We investigate a less orthodox
   form of effectiveness-bill proposals that become law as provisions of
   other bills. Counting these "hitchhiker" bills as additional cases of
   bill sponsorship success reveals a more productive, less hierarchical,
   and less partisan lawmaking process. We argue that agenda and procedural
   constraints are central to understanding why lawmakers pursue hitchhiker
   strategies. We also investigate the legislative vehicles that attract
   hitchhikers and find, among other things, that more Senate bills are
   enacted as hitchhikers on House laws than become law on their own.

AB Sibling violence is an under-researched field, and the impact of
   adolescent family violence (AFV) in particular on siblings is not yet
   well understood. The Australian study Investigating Adolescent Family
   Violence in Victoria elicited responses from siblings who had
   experienced AFV from their brothers or sisters, as well as reflections
   from parents and practitioners on the difficulties of addressing AFV
   directed towards siblings. This article explores characteristics of
   sibling violence identified in this study, impacts of the violence on
   siblings, parents, and families, and responses to sibling violence in
   Victoria, Australia. Siblings described experiencing severe physical,
   psychological, and emotional violence, and beyond this recounted a range
   of difficulties such as not being believed by the adults in their lives;
   the violence being dismissed as normal sibling behavior; an inability to
   access support services without the help of parents or other adults;
   sadness and distress at the loss of the sibling relationship; and
   resentment towards parents for their perceived inaction against the
   violence. Practitioners highlighted the dearth of services and resources
   available for siblings affected by AFV, and the inadequacies of current
   Child Protection responses. This research sheds light on the hidden
   issue of sibling violence and highlights the need for nuanced responses
   rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

AB We study the relationship between inter-class inequality and
   intergenerational class mobility across 39 countries. Previous research
   on the relationship between economic inequality and class mobility
   remains inconclusive, as studies have confounded intra- with
   between-class economic inequalities. We propose that between-class
   inequality across multiple dimensions accounts for the inverse
   relationship between inequality and mobility: the larger the resource
   distance between classes, the less likely it is that mobility from one
   to the other will occur. We consider inequality in terms of
   between-class differences in three areas-education, wages, and
   income-and in a composite measure. Building on sociological mobility
   theory, we argue that cross-country variation in mobility results, in
   part, from families adapting to different levels of between-class
   inequality. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find a negative
   correlation between inter-class inequality and social fluidity, with
   between-class inequality being a better predictor of mobility chances
   than conventional distributional measures. We also find that the
   resource distance between classes is negatively related to the strength
   of their intergenerational association for some off-diagonal origin and
   destination (OD) class combinations.

AB ''Revolving-door" lobbyists are individuals who transition from
   governmental positions into lobbying for private entities. Such
   lobbyists thrive on the insider connections and political knowledge that
   they developed while in government. These assets afford former lawmakers
   more access to and influence over incumbent lawmakers. The value of
   their connections and knowledge, however, is contingent on former
   colleagues remaining within the legislature. As new legislators enter
   the assembly, the connections and knowledge of former members expire and
   lose value. Whereas increases in turnover or assembly size generate more
   former lawmakers who might lobby, such increases negatively affect
   former members' value as lobbyists. Interest groups accordingly hire
   fewer former legislators to lobby. Other factors, such as longer
   cooling-off periods or increased legislative staff resources, produce
   slight or no substantive effects on rates of revolving. Legislative
   characteristics mostly determine rates of revolving for former
   lawmakers.

AB Racial disparities persist throughout the employment process, with
   African Americans experiencing significant barriers compared to whites.
   This article advances the understanding of racial labor market
   stratification by bringing new theoretical insights and original data to
   bear on the ways social networks shape racial disparities in employment
   opportunities. We develop and articulate two pathways through which
   networks may perpetuate racial inequality in the labor market: network
   access and network returns. In the first case, African American job
   seekers may receive fewer job leads through their social networks than
   white job seekers, limiting their access to employment opportunities. In
   the second case, black and white job seekers may utilize their social
   networks at similar rates, but their networks may differ in
   effectiveness. Our data, with detailed information about both job
   applications and job offers, provide the unique ability to adjudicate
   between these processes. We find evidence that black and white job
   seekers utilize their networks at similar rates, but network-based
   methods are less likely to lead to job offers for African Americans. We
   then theoretically develop and empirically test two mechanisms that may
   explain these differential returns: network placement and network
   mobilization. We conclude by discussing the implications of these
   findings for scholarship on racial stratification and social networks in
   the job search process.

AB Racial stratification is well documented in many spheres of social life.
   Much stratification research assumes that implicit or explicit bias on
   the part of institutional gatekeepers produces disparate racial
   outcomes. Research on status-based expectations provides a good starting
   point for theoretically understanding racial inequalities. In this
   context it is understood that race results in differential expectations
   for performance, producing disparate outcomes. But even here, the
   mechanism (i.e., status-based expectations) is often assumed due to the
   lack of tools to measure status-based expectations. In this article, we
   put forth a new way to measure implicit racial status beliefs and
   theorize how they are related to consensual beliefs about what "most
   people" think. This enables us to assess the mechanisms in the
   relationship between race and disparate outcomes. We conducted two
   studies to assess our arguments. Study 1 demonstrates the measurement
   properties of the implicit status measure. Study 2 shows how implicit
   status beliefs and perceptions of what "most people" think combine to
   shape social influence. We conclude with the implications of this work
   for social psychological research, and for racial stratification more
   generally.

AB Most intergenerational mobility studies rely on either snapshot or
   time-averaged measures of earnings, but have yet to examine resemblance
   of earnings trajectories over the life course of successive generations.
   We propose a linked trajectory mobility approach that decomposes the
   progression of economic status over two generations into associations in
   four life-cycle dimensions: initial position, growth rate, growth
   deceleration, and volatility. Using father-son dyad data from the Panel
   Study of Income Dynamics, we show that men resemble their fathers not
   only in the overall level of earnings but also in the pattern by which
   their earnings develop over time. The intergenerational persistence of
   earnings varies substantially across life stages of both generations; it
   is strongest for fathers' early-career and sons' mid-career, with an
   intergenerational elasticity (IGE) as high as .6. This result can be
   explained by the concurrence of the parent's early career and the
   offspring's early childhood. Our findings suggest the intergenerational
   economic association between parents and offspring is not age-constant
   but is contingent on the respective life stages of both generations and,
   most importantly, the period during which they overlap.

AB Corporations gather massive amounts of personal data to predict how
   individuals will behave so that they can profitably price goods and
   allocate resources. This article investigates the moral foundations of
   such increasingly prevalent market practices. I leverage the case of
   credit scores in car insurance pricing-an early and controversial use of
   algorithmic prediction in the U.S. consumer economy-to unpack the
   premise that predictive data are fair to use and to understand the
   conditions under which people are likely to challenge that moral logic.
   Policymaker resistance to credit-based insurance scores reveals that
   contention arises when predictions depend on mathematical distinctions
   that do not align with broader understandings of good and bad behavior,
   and when theories about why predictions work point to the market holding
   people accountable for actions that are not really their fault. Via a
   de-commensuration process, policymakers realign the market with their
   own notions of moral deservingness. This article thus demonstrates the
   importance of causal understanding and moral categorization for people
   accepting markets as fair. As data and analytics permeate markets of all
   sorts, as well as other domains of social life, these findings have
   implications for how social scientists understand the novel forms of
   stratification that result.

DI 10.1111/1468-4446.12706
EA NOV 2019
PY 2019
AB It is becoming increasingly common to hear life scientists say that high
   quality life science research relies upon high quality laboratory animal
   care. However, the idea that animal care is a crucial part of scientific
   knowledge production is at odds with previous social science and
   historical scholarship regarding laboratory animals. How are we to
   understand this discrepancy? To begin to address this question, this
   paper seeks to disentangle the values of scientists in identifying
   animal care as important to the production of high quality scientific
   research. To do this, we conducted a survey of scientists working in the
   United Kingdom who use animals in their research. The survey found that
   being British is associated with thinking that animal care is a crucial
   part of conducting high quality science. To understand this finding, we
   draw upon the concept of 'civic epistemologies' (Jasanoff 2005;
   Prainsack 2006) and argue that 'animals' and 'care' in Britain may
   converge in taken-for-granted assumptions about what constitutes good
   scientific knowledge. These ideas travel through things like state
   regulations or the editorial policies of science journals, but do not
   necessarily carry the embodied civic epistemology of 'animals' and
   'science' from which such modes of regulating laboratory animal welfare
   comes.

AB Focusing on police chiefs in three states, this study revisits the
   Weberian presumption of the state's monopoly on legitimate violence.
   Seventy-nine interviews with police chiefs in Arizona, Michigan, and
   California allow for an examination of their understanding of gun
   policy. Analysis reveals that they selectively embrace two frames of the
   state's relationship with legitimate violence: gun militarism for
   criminal gun activity associated with black and brown communities and
   drug- and gang-related crime and gun populism with respect to lawfully
   gun-owning Americans, often marked as white and middle class. Sensitive
   to state-level sociolegal regimes, gun populism takes the form of
   antielitism in gun-restrictive California, crime-fighting by proxy in
   gun-permissive Michigan, and co-policing in gun-lax Arizona. The racial
   politics of legitimate violence intersect with state-level gun policies
   selectively to erode police chiefs' investment in the state's monopoly
   on violence, demonstrating that gun politics is pertinent not only for
   understanding violence in the United States but also for understanding
   the racial complexity of U.S. policing.

AB This article integrates literature on social movements and migration to
   examine how migration shapes both the cognitive and social foundations
   of collective action in origin communities. Using longitudinal data and
   in-depth interviews from rural China, the author finds that outward
   migration spurs collective resistance in origin communities and shapes
   the form and scale of collective action. Migration fosters
   noninstitutionalized rather than institutionalized collective action,
   because it induces relational diffusion that empowers peasants to
   mobilize and employ more effective resistance strategies. This holds
   more for small- and medium-size collective action than for large-scale
   mobilizations, mainly because out-migration can also trigger community
   disintegration that inhibits larger-scale action. Furthermore, local
   social institutions condition the role of migration: migration has a
   stronger positive impact in close-knit villages embedded in strong
   lineage networks than in less cohesive villages. The author
   contextualizes the findings against the distinct institutional
   arrangements in China, which were originally engineered to
   disenfranchise rural-origin people but which instead have inadvertently
   politicized migrants and peasants alike.

AB Colorism research often suffers from endogeneity issues related to human
   capital outcomes and researchers' inability to compare the effects of
   skin tone to those of racial classification. Furthermore, colorism
   research focuses on intraracial differences in skin tone inequality
   while insufficiently considering skin tone inequality across racial
   groups. Using data from video broadcasts of the National Collegiate
   Athletic Association's annual, single-elimination Men's Division I
   Basketball Tournament for the years 2000-2010, we quantitatively examine
   comments made by announcers about the performance, physical
   characteristics, and mental characteristics of players across various
   skin tones. Controlling for objective measures of performance, we find
   that announcers are more likely to discuss the performance and mental
   abilities of lighter-skinned players and the physical characteristics of
   darker-skinned players. We argue that, although the two concepts are
   related, skin tone is not simply a proxy for racial classification.
   Rather, skin tone inequality transcends traditional racial boundaries.

AB Whereas research has demonstrated how social cues appearing as
   disinterested social validation can skew valuation processes, interested
   promotion may be at least as important. This factor is examined here via
   the premature death of 720 elite life scientists. Especially when
   scientists are young and their articles have received little attention,
   their deaths stimulate a long-lasting, positive increase in citation
   rates, relative to trajectories for equivalent articles authored by
   counterfactual (i.e., still-living) scientists. These patterns seem
   largely explained by a spike in posthumous recognition efforts by the
   deceased scientists' associates. The upshot is clear evidence of
   informational inefficiency, which derives from the challenges of
   absorbing the massive volume of research produced by the scientific
   community and from its ambivalence about the norm of disinterestedness.

AB Making inferences about aggregate business cycles from regional
   variation alone is difficult because of economic channels and shocks
   that differ between regional and aggregate economies. However, we argue
   that regional business cycles contain valuable information that can help
   discipline models of aggregate fluctuations. We begin by documenting a
   strong relationship across U.S. states between local employment and wage
   growth during the Great Recession. This relationship is much weaker in
   U.S. aggregates. Then, we present a methodology that combines such
   regional and aggregate data in order to estimate a medium-scale New
   Keynesian DSGE model. We find that aggregate demand shocks were
   important drivers of aggregate employment during the Great Recession,
   but the wage stickiness necessary for them to account for the slow
   employment recovery and the modest fall in aggregate wages is
   inconsistent with the flexibility of wages we observe across U.S.
   states. Finally, we show that our methodology yields different
   conclusions about the causes of aggregate employment and wage dynamics
   between 2007 and 2014 than either estimating our model with aggregate
   data alone or performing back-of-the-envelope calculations that directly
   extrapolate from well-identified regional elasticities.

AB This paper shows that bargainers may reach delayed agreements even in
   environments where there is no uncertainty about payoffs or feasible
   actions. Under such conditions, delay may arise when bargainers face
   direct forms of strategic uncertainty-that is, uncertainty about the
   opponent's play. The paper restricts the nature of this uncertainty in
   two important ways. First, it assumes on-path strategic certainty:
   Bargainers face uncertainty only after surprise moves. Second, it
   assumes Battigalli and Siniscalchi's (2002) rationality and common
   strong belief of rationality (RCSBR)-a requirement that bargainers are
   "strategically sophisticated." The main result characterizes the set of
   outcomes consistent with on-path strategic certainty and RCSBR. It shows
   that these assumptions allow for delayed agreement, despite the fact
   that the bargaining environment is one of complete information. The
   source of delay is second-order optimism: Bargainers do not put forward
   "good" offers early in the negotiation process because they fear that
   doing so will cause the other party to become more optimistic about her
   future prospects.

AB A receiver wants to learn multidimensional information from a sender,

   payoff depends on the belief he induces, via an exogenously given
   monotone function. We show that by using a randomized verification
   strategy, the receiver can learn the sender's information fully in many
   cases. We characterize exactly when it is possible to do so. In
   particular, when the exogenous payoff function is submodular, we can
   explicitly describe a full-learning mechanism; when it is (strictly)
   supermodular, full learning is not possible. In leading cases where full
   learning is possible, it can be attained using an indirect mechanism in
   which the sender chooses the probability of verifying each dimension.

AB This paper develops a dynamic model of rational behavior under
   uncertainty, in which the agent maximizes the stream of future
   tau-quantile utilities, for tau is an element of (0,1). That is, the
   agent has a quantile utility preference instead of the standard expected
   utility. Quantile preferences have useful advantages, including the
   ability to capture heterogeneity and allowing the separation between
   risk aversion and elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Although
   quantiles do not share some of the helpful properties of expectations,
   such as linearity and the law of iterated expectations, we are able to
   establish all the standard results in dynamic models. Namely, we show
   that the quantile preferences are dynamically consistent, the
   corresponding dynamic problem yields a value function, via a fixed point
   argument, this value function is concave and differentiable, and the
   principle of optimality holds. Additionally, we derive the corresponding
   Euler equation, which is well suited for using well-known quantile
   regression methods for estimating and testing the economic model. In
   this way, the parameters of the model can be interpreted as structural
   objects. Therefore, the proposed methods provide microeconomic
   foundations for quantile regression methods. To illustrate the
   developments, we construct an intertemporal consumption model and
   estimate the discount factor and elasticity of intertemporal
   substitution parameters across the quantiles. The results provide
   evidence of heterogeneity in these parameters.

AB We provide an axiomatic analysis of dynamic random utility,
   characterizing the stochastic choice behavior of agents who solve
   dynamic decision problems by maximizing some stochastic process (U-t) of
   utilities. We show first that even when (U-t) is arbitrary, dynamic
   random utility imposes new testable across-period restrictions on
   behavior, over and above period-by-period analogs of the static random
   utility axioms. An important feature of dynamic random utility is that
   behavior may appear history-dependent, because period-t choices reveal
   information about U-t, which may be serially correlated; however, our
   key new axioms highlight that the model entails specific limits on the
   form of history dependence that can arise. Second, we show that imposing
   natural Bayesian rationality axioms restricts the form of randomness
   that (U-t) can display. By contrast, a specification of utility shocks
   that is widely used in empirical work violates these restrictions,
   leading to behavior that may display a negative option value and can
   produce biased parameter estimates. Finally, dynamic stochastic choice
   data allow us to characterize important special cases of random
   utility-in particular, learning and taste persistence-that on static
   domains are indistinguishable from the general model.

AB We define and investigate a property of mechanisms that we call
   "strategic simplicity," and that is meant to capture the idea that, in
   strategically simple mechanisms, strategic choices require limited
   strategic sophistication. We define a mechanism to be strategically
   simple if choices can be based on first-order beliefs about the other
   agents' preferences and first-order certainty about the other agents'
   rationality alone, and there is no need for agents to form higher-order
   beliefs, because such beliefs are irrelevant to the optimal strategies.
   All dominant strategy mechanisms are strategically simple. But many more
   mechanisms are strategically simple. In particular, strategically simple
   mechanisms may be more flexible than dominant strategy mechanisms in the
   bilateral trade problem and the voting problem.

AB How should a society choose between two social alternatives if
   participation in the decision process is voluntary and costly, and
   monetary transfers are not feasible? Assuming symmetric independent
   private values, we show that it is utilitarian-optimal to use a linear
   voting rule: votes get alternative-dependent weights, and a default
   obtains if the weighted sum of votes stays below some threshold. Any
   combination of weights and threshold can be optimal. A standard quorum
   rule can be optimal only when it yields the same outcome as a linear
   rule. A linear rule is called upper linear if the default is upset at
   every election result that meets the threshold exactly. We develop a
   perturbation method to characterize equilibria of voting rules in the
   case of small participation costs and show that leaving participation
   voluntary increases welfare for any two-sided upper linear rule that is
   optimal under compulsory participation.

AB I develop a search-and-bargaining model of endogenous intermediation in
   over-the-counter markets. Unlike the existing work, my model allows for
   rich investor heterogeneity in three simultaneous dimensions:
   preferences, inventories, and meeting rates. By comparing trading-volume
   patterns that arise in my model and are observed in practice, I argue
   that the heterogeneity in meeting rates is the main driver of
   intermediation patterns. I find that investors with higher meeting rates
   (i.e., fast investors) are less averse to holding inventories and more
   attracted to cash earnings, which makes the model corroborate a number
   of stylized facts that do not emerge from existing models: (i) fast
   investors provide intermediation by charging a speed premium, and (ii)
   fast investors hold more extreme inventories. Then, I use the model to
   study the effect of trading frictions on the supply and price of
   liquidity. On social welfare, I show that the interaction of meeting
   rate heterogeneity with optimal inventory management makes the
   equilibrium inefficient. I provide a financial transaction tax/subsidy
   scheme that corrects this inefficiency, in which fast investors
   cross-subsidize slow investors.

AB We revisit prominent learning models in which a sequence of agents make
   a binary decision on the basis of both a private signal and information
   related to past choices. We analyze the efficiency of learning in these
   models, measured in terms of the expected welfare. We show that,
   irrespective of the distribution of private signals, learning efficiency
   is the same whether each agent observes the entire sequence of earlier
   decisions or only the previous decision. In addition, we provide a
   simple condition on the signal distributions that is necessary and
   sufficient for learning efficiency. This condition fails to hold in many
   cases of interest. We discuss a number of extensions and variants.

AB The disproportionate incarceration of certain groups, racial minorities,
   and the less educated constitutes a social problem from the perspective
   of both policy makers and researchers. One aspect that is poorly
   understood is whether the public is similarly concerned about inequities
   in mass incarceration. Using a list experiment embedded in a framing
   experiment, we test for differences in attitudes towards mass
   incarceration by exploring three frames: race, education, and the United
   States in global context. We test whether social desirability bias
   causes people to over-state their concern about mass incarceration when
   directly queried. We find that mass incarceration is seen as a problem
   in the United States, whether the issue is framed by race, education, or
   as a global outlier. The list experiment reveals that public concern
   about mass incarceration is not quite as great as overtly-expressed
   opinion would suggest, and the framing experiment indicates that
   race-neutral frames evoke greater concern about mass incarceration than
   an emphasis on racial disparities.

AB This research examines the way color-blind rhetorical techniques are
   used by supporters and opponents in legal documents submitted to the
   latest U.S. Supreme court case on affirmative action. Eduardo
   Bonilla-Silva posited that color-blind ideology is the dominant racial
   ideology in the United States. We focused our critical discourse
   analysis particularly on the use of color-blind frames as described by
   Bonilla-Silva. This research also assesses how group threat was used
   within color-blind frames to activate feelings of racial animosity, a
   distinction from the color-blind frames that act to minimize race.
   Drawing on data from 184 amicus briefs submitted for 2013 and 2016 and
   using critical discourse analysis, we found both supporters and
   opponents used color-blind frames, but that these frames were more
   prevalent (and distinctively used) in opponents' briefs, where we
   observed all four of Bonilla-Silva's color-blind frames. We also found
   the use of threat by opponents to be distinct and prevalent, suggesting
   that affirmative action was framed as a source of competition that
   threatened resources held in high regard by white America. We discuss
   the implications of these findings for the future of affirmative action
   and make suggestions for future research.

AB The number of regulations surrounding abortion has increased drastically
   in recent years. It is important to assess how these laws relate to
   abortion timing, since the cost, safety, and accessibility of abortion
   varies by how many weeks pregnant a woman is when the procedure occurs.
   Research examining how state laws relate to abortion timing generally
   use rates or data from vital statistics; while informative, such methods
   do not allow researchers to examine how these laws may be
   disproportionately associated with abortion timing among select groups
   of women, including poor and nonwhite women. To fill this research gap,
   I analyze data from the nationally representative 2008 Abortion Patient
   Survey, with appended information on state laws regarding abortion in
   2008. I find that laws requiring second trimester abortions be performed
   in a hospital and both in-person counselling and waiting periods have
   different associations with abortion timing based on race and
   income-to-poverty status. Predicted abortion timing for black and
   Hispanic women differs based on state laws and their income-to-poverty
   status, while for white women, models show that the association between
   state laws and abortion timing is not dependent on their
   income-to-poverty status. Overall, this research illustrates the
   relevance of state-level abortion laws for shaping abortion timing among
   women, highlighting how these relationships differ across racial and
   socioeconomic groups in the United States.

AB Since gender organizes key reentry services such as housing, formerly
   incarcerated people seeking resources must successfully inhabit a gender
   category. Drawing on seven months of ethnography and 79 interviews with
   service providers and formerly incarcerated transgender people, I show
   that these organizational practices of gender categorization are
   racialized and impact resource access. Most gender-segregated housing
   programs rely on biology-based definitions of gender. These gender rules
   create workable options for trans men to stay with women, but bar trans
   women from women's spaces. Once in gendered housing programs, clients
   need to navigate gender assessment in interactions. Trans men employed
   several strategies to establish gendered selves who were easily
   categorized as either male or female, which allowed them to access
   stable housing. Gender sanctioning posed a major problem for black trans
   women. Black trans women were highly scrutinized in women's programs,
   characterized as illegitimate based on biological definitions of gender,
   and harassed for any perceived deviation from gender norms. When
   harassment escalated into conflict, they were expelled from programs.
   Regulation of black trans women's womanhood led to systematic material
   deprivation. By understanding the connections between categorical
   exclusions and exclusion from resources we can better understand the
   reproduction of reentry hardship and inequality more broadly.

   on interviews with incarcerated men, we demonstrate how humor is used to
   criticize authorities, for self-aggrandizement, and to alleviate the
   pain of tragic experiences. Funny remarks and stories are often
   ambiguous and evade simple categorization, which may explain why humor
   is neglected in the study of social problems. We argue that researchers

AB Recent work has offered competing explanations for the long-term
   evolution of corporate political action in the United States. In one,
   scholars have theorized that long-term structural changes in the
   American political and economic landscape may have radically transformed
   inter-corporate network structures and changed the political orientation
   of corporate elites. In another, a small group of corporate elites
   continues to dominate government policy by advocating for class-wide
   interests through occupying key positions in government and policy
   planning groups. We offer new evidence of patterns in and predictors of
   political strategies among the nation's elite corporate directors. We
   utilize an original dataset (the Longitudinal Elite Contributor
   Database) linked with registries of corporate directors and their board
   memberships. We ask: (1) has the political activity, unity, or
   pragmatism of the corporate elite declined since 1982; and (2) are
   individuals who direct multiple firms more pragmatic in their political
   action? Evidence suggests that corporate elites are more politically
   active and unified, and continue to exercise pragmatic political
   strategies vis-a-vis their campaign donations. Using random- and
   fixed-effects models, we present evidence to suggest that becoming a
   member of the inner circle has a significant moderating effect on elite
   political behavior. We offer an alternative mechanism of elite
   coordination that may help explain the continued political cohesion of
   the corporate elite.

AB This study asks one crucial question: How do Lebanese women apply
   available social capital and informal social networks to engage in
   political activism for women's rights? Building on social- and
   women's-movement theories, I argue that Lebanese feminists do not
   exclusively operate in the public sphere in their fight for political
   goals, nor do they privilege only the extra-family space. On the
   contrary, they engage in political activities by using extended family
   networks as a form of weak social ties. I construct this argument on the
   basis of interviews, observations, and analysis of Lebanese feminists'
   writings. This paper introduces the concept of mahsoubieh as a form of
   weak social ties generated within connective family networks.
   Specifically, I examine how elite, intellectual, and middle-class
   Lebanese women activists use the positive social capital generated by
   mahsoubieh to gain credibility, diffuse their political stances, and
   develop countervailing power. Aspects such as the size, reputation, and
   respectability of their kinship networks aided the Lebanese women in
   their fight to change the legal structure concerning women's rights and
   political representation.

AB Partisan selectivity of news media and attitudinal polarization are
   linked, yet the bulk of research focuses on the role of political
   attitudes while neglecting religious dispositions. We consider the
   degree to which both network and cable news media offend viewers in
   terms of both politics and religion. Using data from the 2010 Baylor
   Religion Survey, we find that white evangelicals have higher odds than
   mainline Protestants of reporting taking offense from the evening news,
   as well as higher odds than religious non-affiliates of being offended
   by both types of news. The primary divide, however, was between
   affiliates and non-affiliates, as biblical literalism and religious
   exclusivism at least partially mediated differences between white
   evangelicals and mainliners in taking offense from the evening news.
   Religious service attendance at least partially mediated differences
   between affiliates and non-affiliates in taking offense from both types
   of news, but while political conservatism explained differences in being
   offended by the evening news, it was not a significant predictor of
   taking offense from cable news. We suggest that this is due to processes
   of media differentiation that make cable news an equal-opportunity
   offender.

   business profit, which can include entrepreneurial labor income for tax
   reasons. This article asks whether top pass-through profit mostly
   reflects human capital, defined as all inalienable factors embodied in
   business owners, rather than financial capital. Tax data linking 11
   million firms to their owners show that top pass-through profit accrues
   to working-age owners of closely held mid-market firms in
   skill-intensive industries. Pass-through profit falls by three-quarters
   after owner retirement or premature death. Classifying three-quarters of
   pass-through profit as human capital income, we find that the typical
   top earner derives most of her income from human capital, not financial
   capital. Growth in pass-through profit is explained by both rising
   productivity and a rising share of value added accruing to owners. JEL

   behaviors than nonparticipants. The program persistently increased

AB The best worker is not always the best candidate for manager. In these
   cases, do firms promote the best potential manager or the best worker in

   at 131 firms, we find evidence consistent with the Peter Principle,
   which proposes that firms prioritize current job performance in
   promotion decisions at the expense of other observable characteristics
   that better predict managerial performance. We estimate that the costs
   of promoting workers with lower managerial potential are high,
   suggesting either that firms are making inefficient promotion decisions
   or that the benefits of promotion-based incentives are great enough to
   justify the costs of managerial mismatch. We find that firms manage the
   costs of the Peter Principle by placing less weight on sales performance
   in promotion decisions when managerial roles entail greater
   responsibility and when frontline workers are incentivized by strong pay
   for performance. JEL Codes: M51, M52, J24, M12, J33, J31.

AB How does parties' use of moral rhetoric affect voter behavior? Prior
   comparative party research has studied party positions without much
   attention to how parties explain and justify their positions. Drawing
   insights from political and moral psychology, I argue that moral
   rhetoric mobilizes copartisan voters by activating positive emotions
   about their partisan preference. I expect this to hold among copartisans
   who are exposed to party rhetoric. To test my argument, I measure moral
   rhetoric by text-analyzing party manifestos from six English-speaking
   democracies and measure mobilization using copartisan turnout in survey
   data. The results support my argument. Furthermore, I find evidence in
   support of the theoretical mechanism using survey experiments and panel
   survey data from Britain. The article shows that moral rhetoric is a
   party campaign frame that has important consequences for voter behavior.

AB Circuit splits, or conflicting rules across multiple U.S. Courts of
   Appeals, have important policy implications and dramatic effects on
   Supreme Court case selection, yet we know little about the incentives
   ideological lower courts face when deciding whether to initiate
   conflict. This article develops a formal model of a judicial hierarchy
   where lower court judges are subject to review by a high court with
   distaste for unresolved conflict, termed "split-intolerance," and with
   uncertain preferences over policy. Lower courts may compete by investing
   costly effort in legal quality to make their rules more attractive. In
   equilibrium, lower courts may initiate conflict even when the odds of
   success before the high court are remote. Surprisingly, lower courts
   grow more likely to create conflict as the high court's
   split-intolerance increases; however, split-intolerance can also
   incentivize greater lower court effort. I present qualitative evidence
   illustrating the model's explanatory power.

AB Asset mobility is thought to constrain taxation, as firms with mobile
   assets can avoid taxation by locating their assets in low-tax
   jurisdictions. Firms with immobile assets then face higher taxes. By
   considering the political incentives that accompany widespread
   financialization, we identify a new limit to the targeting of immobile
   firms: Publicly traded firms with immobile underlying assets lose more
   value in financial markets when taxes are increased, as shareholders
   anticipate that these underlying assets cannot be withheld from
   taxation. When governments care about this loss in value, their
   incentive to tax immobile, publicly traded firms declines. Political
   concern for financial performance therefore limits the extent to which
   immobile assets can be targeted for taxation. We argue that broad-based
   participation in the stock market and democratic political institutions
   increase political concern for financial performance. We discuss the
   implications of the theory and findings for policy autonomy, firm
   ownership, and economic voting.

AB Studies of clientelism overwhelmingly focus on how brokers target voters
   with top-down benefits during elections. Yet brokers also receive
   requests from voters for assistance between elections, initiating the
   processes through which they cultivate clients. Why are brokers
   responsive to the requests of some voters and not others? We provide the
   first study of broker preferences when evaluating client appeals.
   Theories emphasizing brokers as vote monitors anticipate they will
   prefer co-partisans and coethnics, whose reciprocity they can best
   verify. Theories emphasizing brokers as vote mobilizers anticipate they
   will prefer residents who will maximize their reputations for efficacy.
   We test these expectations through a conjoint experiment with 629 Indian
   slum leaders, ethnographic fieldwork, and a survey of 2,199 slum
   residents. We find evidence of reputational considerations shaping
   broker responsiveness. We find mixed support for monitoring concerns,
   highlighted by an absence of the strong ethnic favoritism assumed to
   dominate distributive politics in many developing countries.

AB Elections are designed to give voters the ability to hold elected
   officials accountable for their actions. For this to work, voters must
   be presented with credible alternatives from which to choose. In the
   United States, as in other weak-party systems, the decision to challenge
   an incumbent representative rests with individual, strategic-minded
   politicians who carefully weigh the available information. We
   investigate the role that one source of information-partisan media-plays
   in shaping electoral competition. We hypothesize that the haphazard
   expansion of the conservative Fox News Channel in the decade after its
   1996 launch influenced congressional elections by affecting the decision
   calculus of high-quality potential candidates. Using congressional
   district-level data on the local availability of Fox News, we find that
   Fox News altered Republican potential candidates' perceptions about the
   vulnerability of Democratic incumbents, thereby changing their entry

AB Authority over related policy issues is often dispersed among multiple

   delegate to multiple agencies, and how shared regulatory space
   complicates agency decision making. To do so, I develop a formal model
   of decentralized policymaking with two agencies that incorporates
   information acquisition and information sharing, delineating situations
   where legislators should and should not prefer multiple agencies.
   Greater divergence between the agencies' ideal points distorts
   information sharing and policy choices, but it may increase the amount
   of information acquisition. Congress achieves better policy outcomes by
   delegating authority to both agencies if the agencies have strong policy
   disagreements. If the agencies have similar policy preferences, however,
   then Congress may want to consolidate authority within one agency
   because this approach mitigates free-riding and takes advantage of
   returns to scale.

AB Measurement error threatens the validity of survey research, especially
   when studying sensitive questions. Although list experiments can help
   discourage deliberate misreporting, they may also suffer from
   nonstrategic measurement error due to flawed implementation and
   respondents' inattention. Such error runs against the assumptions of the
   standard maximum likelihood regression (MLreg) estimator for list
   experiments and can result in misleading inferences, especially when the
   underlying sensitive trait is rare. We address this problem by providing
   new tools for diagnosing and mitigating measurement error in list
   experiments. First, we demonstrate that the nonlinear least squares
   regression (NLSreg) estimator proposed in Imai (2011) is robust to
   nonstrategic measurement error. Second, we offer a general model
   misspecification test to gauge the divergence of the MLreg and NLSreg
   estimates. Third, we show how to model measurement error directly,
   proposing new estimators that preserve the statistical efficiency of
   MLreg while improving robustness. Last, we revisit empirical studies
   shown to exhibit nonstrategic measurement error, and demonstrate that
   our tools readily diagnose and mitigate the bias. We conclude this
   article with a number of practical recommendations for applied
   researchers. The proposed methods are implemented through an open-source
   software package.

AB Localized network processes are central to the study of political
   science, whether in the formation of political coalitions and voting
   blocs, balancing and bandwagoning, policy learning, imitation,
   diffusion, tipping-point dynamics, or cascade effects. These types of
   processes are not easily modeled using traditional network approaches,
   which focus on global rather than local structures within networks. We
   show that localized network processes, in which network edges form in
   response to the formation of other edges, are best modeled by shifting
   from the traditional theoretical framework of nodes-as-actors to what we
   term a nodes-as-actions framework, which allows for zeroing in on
   relationships among network connections. We show that the proposed
   theoretical framework is statistically compatible with a local structure
   graph model (LSGM). We demonstrate the properties of LSGMs using a Monte
   Carlo experiment and explore action-reaction processes in two empirical
   applications: formation of alliances among countries and legislative

AB We develop a new Bayesian split population survival model for the
   analysis of survival data with misclassified event failures. Within
   political science survival data, right-censored survival cases are often
   erroneously misclassified as failure cases due to measurement error.
   Treating these cases as failure events within survival analyses will
   underestimate the duration of some events. This will bias coefficient
   estimates, especially in situations where such misclassification is
   associated with covariates of interest. Our split population survival
   estimator addresses this challenge by using a system of two equations to
   explicitly model the misclassification of failure events alongside a
   parametric survival process of interest. After deriving this model, we
   use Bayesian estimation via slice sampling to evaluate its performance
   with simulated data, and in several political science applications. We
   find that our proposed "misclassified failure" survival model allows
   researchers to accurately account for misclassified failure events
   within the contexts of civil war duration and democratic survival.

AB We show that propensity score matching (PSM), an enormously popular

   the opposite of its intended goal-thus increasing imbalance,
   inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. The weakness of PSM comes from
   its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather
   than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked
   randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large
   portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full
   blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough
   to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after
   pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we
   show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although
   these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other
   available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive

AB Opinion surveys often employ multiple items to measure the respondent's
   underlying value, belief, or attitude. To analyze such types of data,
   researchers have often followed a two-step approach by first
   constructing a composite measure and then using it in subsequent
   analysis. This paper presents a class of hierarchical item response
   models that help integrate measurement and analysis. In this approach,
   individual responses to multiple items stem from a latent preference, of
   which both the mean and variance may depend on observed covariates.
   Compared with the two-step approach, the hierarchical approach reduces
   bias, increases efficiency, and facilitates direct comparison across
   surveys covering different sets of items. Moreover, it enables us to
   investigate not only how preferences differ among groups, vary across
   regions, and evolve over time, but also levels, patterns, and trends of
   attitude polarization and ideological constraint. An open-source R
   package, hIRT, is available for fitting the proposed models.

AB Researchers face a tradeoff when applying latent variable models to
   time-series, cross-sectional data. Static models minimize bias but
   assume data are temporally independent, resulting in a loss of
   efficiency. Dynamic models explicitly model temporal data structures,
   but smooth estimates of the latent trait across time, resulting in bias
   when the latent trait changes rapidly. We address this tradeoff by
   investigating a new approach for modeling and evaluating latent variable
   estimates: a robust dynamic model. The robust model is capable of
   minimizing bias and accommodating volatile changes in the latent trait.
   Simulations demonstrate that the robust model outperforms other models
   when the underlying latent trait is subject to rapid change, and is
   equivalent to the dynamic model in the absence of volatility. We
   reproduce latent estimates from studies of judicial ideology and
   democracy. For judicial ideology, the robust model uncovers shocks in
   judicial voting patterns that were not previously identified in the
   dynamic model. For democracy, the robust model provides more precise
   estimates of sudden institutional changes such as the imposition of
   martial law in the Philippines (1972-1981) and the short-lived Saur
   Revolution in Afghanistan (1978). Overall, the robust model is a useful
   alternative to the standard dynamic model for modeling latent traits
   that change rapidly over time.

AB Political scientists can rely on a long tradition of applying
   unsupervised measurement models to estimate ideology and preferences
   from texts. However, in practice the hope that the dominant source of
   variation in their data is the quantity of interest is often not
   realized. In this paper, I argue that in the messy world of speeches we
   have to rely on supervised approaches that include information on party
   affiliation in order to produce meaningful estimates of polarization. To
   substantiate this argument, I introduce a validation framework that may
   be used to comparatively assess supervised and unsupervised methods, and
   estimate polarization on the basis of 6.2 million records of
   parliamentary speeches from the UK House of Commons over the period
   1811-2015. Beyond introducing several important adjustments to existing
   estimation approaches, the paper's methodological contribution therefore
   consists of outlining the challenges of applying unsupervised estimation
   techniques to speech data, and arguing in detail why we should instead
   rely on supervised methods to measure polarization.

AB The analysis of list experiments depends on two assumptions, known as

   may fail in many list experiments. I relax the no liars assumption in
   this paper, and develop a method to provide bounds for the prevalence of
   sensitive behaviors or attitudes under a weaker behavioral assumption
   about respondents' truthfulness toward the sensitive item. I apply the
   method to a list experiment on the anti-immigration attitudes of
   California residents and on a broad set of existing list experiment
   datasets. The prevalence of different items and the correlation
   structure among items on the list jointly determine the width of the
   bound estimates. In particular, the bounds tend to be narrower when the
   list consists of items of the same category, such as multiple groups or
   organizations, different corporate activities, and various
   considerations for politician decision-making. My paper illustrates when
   the full power of the no liars assumption is most needed to pin down the
   prevalence of the sensitive behavior or attitude, and facilitates
   estimation of the prevalence robust to violations of the no liars
   assumption for many list experiment applications.

   covariates from the administrative data available for both respondents

AB Difference-in-differences is a widely used evaluation strategy that
   draws causal inference from observational panel data. Its causal
   identification relies on the assumption of parallel trends, which is
   scale-dependent and may be questionable in some applications. A common
   alternative is a regression model that adjusts for the lagged dependent
   variable, which rests on the assumption of ignorability conditional on
   past outcomes. In the context of linear models, Angrist and Pischke
   (2009) show that the difference-in-differences and
   lagged-dependent-variable regression estimates have a bracketing
   relationship. Namely, for a true positive effect, if ignorability is
   correct, then mistakenly assuming parallel trends will overestimate the
   effect; in contrast, if the parallel trends assumption is correct, then
   mistakenly assuming ignorability will underestimate the effect. We show
   that the same bracketing relationship holds in general nonparametric
   (model-free) settings. We also extend the result to semiparametric
   estimation based on inverse probability weighting. We provide three

AB The occurrence and timing of major demographic decisions in the
   transition to adulthood is strongly stratified, with young adults with a
   high socio-economic status (SES) background usually experiencing many of
   these events later than young adults with a low SES background. To
   explain this social stratification, we outline a theoretical framework
   in which social stratification affects choice in the transition to
   adulthood through three, potentially reinforcing, pathways: stratified
   socialization, stratified agency, and stratified opportunity. We test
   our framework against longitudinal data from two waves of the
   Generations and Gender Surveys for Austria, Bulgaria, and France. We
   find evidence for the importance of all three pathways. Furthermore,
   processes differ little by gender, age and country context.

AB Parental time spent with children is a critical determinant for a
   child's cognitive, educational, and socio-emotional development. Using
   two waves of the Spanish Time Use Surveys, this study aims to
   investigate how mothers and fathers reorganized the time invested in
   physical and developmental childcare between 2002 and 2010. Results show
   that, during the period analyzed (marked by the start of the Great
   Recession in 2007), there had been: (i) a significant increase in the
   time fathers and mothers invested in childcare (i.e. an intensification
   of parenting); (ii) a gender convergence in physical care time,
   primarily driven by couples with very young children; and (iii) the gap
   in developmental childcare time invested between parents with and
   without a university degree remained unchanged. The decomposition of the
   results shows that the increase in father-child time is explained by a
   combination of changes in behavioural and compositional factors (i.e.
   increase in unemployment and level of education), whereas for changes in
   mother-child time, behavioural factors predominantly applied. These
   findings reinforce ideas of the rapid intensification of parenting, and
   a slow movement towards gender convergence in parental time spent with
   children.

AB Political developments since the 2008 financial crisis have sparked
   renewed interest in the electoral implications of economic downturns.
   Research describes a correlation between adverse economic conditions and
   support for radical parties campaigning on the populist promise to
   retake the country from a corrupt elite. But does the success of radical
   parties following economic crises rely on people who are directly
   affected? To answer this question, we examine whether individual-level
   changes in economic circumstances drive support for radical parties
   across the ideological divide. Analysing eight waves of panel data
   collected in the Netherlands, before, during, and after the Great
   Recession (2007-2015), we demonstrate that people who experienced an
   income loss became more supportive of the radical left but not of the
   radical right. Looking at these parties' core concerns, we find that
   income loss increased support for income redistribution championed by
   the radical left, but less so for the anti-immigration policies
   championed by the radical right. Our study establishes more directly
   than extant research the micro-foundations of support for radical
   parties across the ideological divide.

AB In the wake of rising inequality in Germany during the last 20 years, we
   document a corresponding increase in perceptions of injustice among the
   population. Based on data from the cumulated German General Social
   Survey (ALLBUS), we show that this increase in perceived injustice is
   driven mainly by a rising share of affluent respondents who find society
   unjust, resulting in a convergence across income groups towards more
   critical attitudes. We try to explain this puzzling development based on
   outcome-related justice assessments and perceptions of procedural
   justice. We find that outcome-related justice assessments cannot explain
   the trend over time, but affect the overall level of injustice
   perceptions. The influence of perceptions of procedural justice,
   however, is more pronounced among affluent respondents and partly
   explains the increase in injustice perceptions within this group. These
   results are robust for different operationalizations as well as model
   specifications and are not due to compositional effects. Since we cannot
   account entirely for the rise in injustice perceptions among the
   affluent, explanatory factors not covered by our data are likely to
   exist. We conclude with a discussion of potential explanations that
   future research should address.

AB Despite considerable variation in gender-role attitudes across contexts
   and its claimed influence on female labour supply, studies provide
   little support for a contextual gender-role attitude effect. In this
   study, we reassess the contextual gender-role attitude effect on female
   labour supply because earlier studies are hampered by two shortcomings:
   (a) they are cross-nationally comparative, which makes it difficult to
   distinguish contextual attitude from institutional effects; (b) they are
   cross-sectional, which may bias the contextual attitude effect. We aim
   to overcome these shortcomings by performing longitudinal panel analyses
   on data from the British Household Panel Survey 1991-2007, comparing 138
   counties within the United Kingdom. Our fixed-effects regressions report
   no significant and substantial association of regional, egalitarian
   gender-role attitudes with individual women's labour supply, a finding
   which both holds for women's probability to be active in the labour
   market and employed women's working hours, and for women with and
   without (young) children. Female labour supply appears to be much
   stronger associated with women's own and partners' gender-role
   attitudes, in particular for women with (young) children.

AB We examine the impact of parental unemployment and regional labour
   market conditions on the probability of a successful transition from
   non-academic secondary schooling to vocational training in Germany,
   using data from the National Educational Panel Study and multilevel
   logistic regression models. Although widely regarded as a low-cost,
   low-risk and high-gain vocational path, we nevertheless find a clear
   negative effect of parental unemployment on adolescents' chances of
   entering an apprenticeship contract. We test for poorer school
   performance, reduced household income, reduced self-esteem and limited
   access to labour market information as potential mediators of the
   effect, and only find support for some limited impact of economic
   deprivation. However, we also show that in families where one parent has
   experienced unemployment shortly before the child's own transition from
   secondary schooling, students' chances of a successful transition depend
   much more strongly on regional labour market conditions than in families
   without parental experiences of unemployment. Even in a regulated
   transition system like Germany's, adverse labour market conditions thus
   reinforce the intergenerational disadvantages induced by parental
   unemployment.

AB A recent literature argues that the labour market returns to vocational
   education vary over the life cycle. Graduates with an
   occupation-specific educational degree have a smooth transition into the
   labour market but experience difficulties later in their career when
   their specific skills become obsolete. This life course penalty to
   vocational education is expected to be particularly strong in periods of
   rapid technological change. Existing literature has mostly studied this
   topic from the perspective of age effects but focused less on cohort and
   period effects. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent lower returns to
   vocational education in the late career vary across time periods. Using
   Labour Force Survey data for the Netherlands (1996-2012) we find that
   having a more occupation-specific educational degree increases the
   likelihood of being employed in early life and lowers the average job
   status. This initial advantage of a higher employment probability
   declines with age, and the disadvantage in job status increases as
   workers grow older. We find that these life-cycle effects have not, or
   only marginally, changed over time.

AB In all European countries, social assistance legislation specifies that
   the receipt of benefits is conditional upon the willingness to work.
   Nevertheless, the manner in which such policies are implemented in
   practice has remained a black box. From the literature on social policy,
   social work, and social administration, we know that implementation is
   the result of decisions at multiple levels. To our knowledge, however,
   this study is the first quantitative attempt to bring together the
   insights from these various strands of literature into a combined
   assessment of factors that determine willingness-to-work assessments. We
   build on an innovative and purpose-designed survey of social workers in
   Belgium. We identified factors determining the perceptions of 584 case
   managers, clustered in 89 municipalities, with regard to sanction
   decisions upon job refusal, based on almost 5,000 experimentally varied
   client cases (vignette experiment). These unique data make it possible
   to distinguish between the effects of case managers who assess
   individual cases and characteristics of the local welfare agencies and
   municipalities in which they operate. The results reveal relatively
   little variation between municipalities, which can be largely explained
   by characteristics of the municipalities (e.g. political ideology and
   organizational setting). Surprisingly, however, we find extensive
   variation at the case-manager level. Although some of this variation
   remains unexplained, a substantial share can be explained by
   characteristics of individual case managers (e.g. age and attitudes
   concerning the welfare state). This finding raises concerns about the
   unintended consequences of the broad discretion granted to case managers
   within contemporary social assistance schemes.

AB The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) study is a rich resource for
   sociologists, mainly because it offers direct measures of respondents'
   contexts. The SOEP data provide (i) information retrieved from
   individuals themselves, (ii) direct information retrieved from their
   parents, partners, and organizations, (iii) prospectively collected
   information on past characteristics, and (iv) regional and spatial
   identifiers allowing researchers to link the data with regional-level
   characteristics. As the study has been in the field since 1984, the data
   also reflect variation in institutional and structural settings over
   time. Regular refreshment samples provide options to identify cohort
   effects. Together, these features allow multi-layered contextual designs
   that offer substantive insights into the effects of formal and informal
   institutions on individual behaviour and living conditions. This article
   introduces the main types of SOEP-based sociological research designs
   and discusses their survey methodological origins. It also points to
   underexplored potentials as well as limitations of the SOEP. Finally, it
   offers basic suggestions for approaching the data in each of the
   research designs presented.

AB Estimates of historical workers' annual incomes suffer from the
   fundamental problem that they are inferred from day wage rates without
   knowing how many days of work day-labourers undertook per year. We
   circumvent the problem by building an income series based on the
   payments made to workers employed by the year rather than by the day.
   Our data suggest that earlier annual income estimates based on day wages
   overestimate medieval labour incomes but underestimate labour incomes
   during the Industrial Revolution. Our revised estimates indicate that
   modern economic growth began more than two centuries earlier than
   commonly thought and was driven by an 'Industrious Revolution'. They
   also suggest that the current global downturn in labour's share is not
   exceptional but fits within the range of historical fluctuations.

AB Familiar explanations of why hunter-gatherers first took up
   farming-superior labor productivity, population pressure, or adverse
   climate-receive little support from recent evidence. Farming would be an
   unlikely choice without possession-based private property, which appears
   to have existed among rare groups of sedentary hunter-gatherers who
   became the first farmers. Our model shows that among them, farming could
   have benefited first adopters because private possession was more
   readily established and defended for cultivated crops and domesticated
   animals than for the diffuse wild resources on which hunter-gatherers
   relied, thus explaining how farming could have been introduced even
   without a productivity advantage.

AB Research into the effects of climate on political and economic outcomes
   assumes that short-term variation in weather is exogenous to the
   phenomena being studied. However, weather data are derived from stations
   operated by national governments, whose political capacity and stability
   affect the quality and continuity of coverage. We show that civil
   conflict risk in sub-Saharan Africa is negatively correlated with the
   number and density of weather stations contributing to a country's
   temperature record. This effect is both cross-sectional-countries with
   higher average conflict risk tend to have poorer coverage-and
   cross-temporal-civil conflict leads to loss of weather stations. Poor
   coverage induces a small downward bias in one widely used temperature
   data set, due to its interpolation method, and increases measurement
   error, potentially attenuating estimates of the temperature-conflict
   relationship. Combining multiple observational data sets to reduce
   measurement error almost doubles the estimated effect of temperature

AB Republicans hold that people are dominated merely in virtue of others'
   having unconstrained abilities to frustrate their choices. They argue
   further that public officials may dominate citizens unless subject to
   popular control. Critics identify a dilemma. To maintain the possibility
   of popular control, republicans must attribute to the people an ability
   to control public officials merely in virtue of the possibility that
   they might coordinate their actions. But if the possibility of
   coordination suffices for attributing abilities to groups, then, even in
   the best case, countless groups will be dominating because it will be
   possible for their members to coordinate their actions with the aim of
   frustrating others' choices. We argue the dilemma is apparent only. To
   make our argument, we present a novel interpretation of the republican
   concept of domination with the help of a game-theoretic model that
   clarifies the significance of collective action problems for republican
   theory.

AB Despite the importance of ethnic television within immigrant
   communities, its effects on political participation are unclear. On the
   one hand, ethnic media can mobilize and inform voters. On the other
   hand, it can serve as a source of diversion and reduce the desire to
   participate. To evaluate these competing possibilities, we implement a
   geographic regression discontinuity (GRD) approach involving Federal
   Communication Commission reception boundaries for Spanish-language
   television stations in two states. Additionally, we replicate and unpack
   our GRD analyses using three nationally representative samples of
   Latinos. Across multiple studies, we find that access to
   Spanish-language television is associated with decreases in turnout,
   ethnic civic participation, and political knowledge. We conclude by
   discussing the implications of these findings on the ethnic politics,
   political communication, and social capital literatures.

AB Scholars often evaluate citizens' democratic competence by focusing on
   their ability to get relevant facts right. In this article, I show why
   this approach can yield misleading conclusions about citizen competence.
   I argue that although citizens with strong partisan loyalties might be
   forced to accept the same facts, they find alternative ways to
   rationalize reality. One such way, I show, is through the selective
   attribution of credit and blame. With four randomized experiments,
   conducted in diverse national settings and containing closed- as well as
   open-ended questions, I find that as partisans correctly updated
   economic beliefs to reflect new facts, they conversely attributed
   responsibility in a highly selective fashion. Although partisans might
   acknowledge the same facts, they are apt in seizing on and producing
   attributional arguments that fit their preferred worldviews.

AB Some women did not participate in the Women's March, rejecting its
   claims of unity and solidarity because white women mobilize only in
   their self-interest. This is a form of exit with three features: (1)
   rejecting a political claim; (2) providing reasons to the power wielder
   and the broader public; and (3) demanding accountability both as
   sanction and as deliberation, which requires a discussion about the
   claim-in this case, the meaning of the group and the terms on which it
   understands itself. This combination of exit, voice, and deliberative
   accountability might accurately be called "discursive exit." Discursive
   exit addresses conceptual and normative limitations of standard accounts
   of exit, voice, and loyalty, in particular, when exit and voice are
   imperfect-because exit can be seen as disapproval of an entire cause-and
   morally problematic-because voice "from within" implies that cause
   trumps disagreement, leaving people morally complicit in an unwelcome
   exercise of power.

AB Do voters polarize ideologically when radical views gain political
   legitimacy, or does the rise of radical voices merely reflect societal
   conflict? We argue that elite polarization as signaled by radical
   parties' first entrance into parliament leads to voter divergence.
   Immediately after the election, legitimization and backlash effects mean
   that voters on both ideological sides move toward the extremes. In the
   longer term, this polarization is solidified because of radical parties'
   parliamentary presence. A panel study of Dutch voters shows that the
   2002 parliamentary entrance of a radical-right party indeed led to
   immediate ideological polarization across the political spectrum.
   Estimating time-series cross-sectional models on Eurobarometer data from
   17 countries (1973-2016) shows an additional long-term impact of
   radical-right party entry on polarization. The presence of radical
   voices on the right has polarizing effects, illustrating how such
   institutional recognition and legitimization can have a far-reaching
   impact on society.

AB Party support has a strong influence on candidate success in the

   demographic data at the congressional level and measures of party
   support for primary candidates, we test whether parties discriminate
   against women and minority candidates in congressional primaries and
   also whether parties are strategic in their support of minority
   candidates in certain primaries. Our findings show parties are not
   biased against minority candidates and also that white women candidates
   receive more support from the Democratic Party than do other types of
   candidates. Our findings also suggest that parties do not appear to
   strategically support minority candidates in districts with larger

AB Few innovations in democratic institutional design are considered as
   fundamental as the introduction of voting through the use of a uniform,
   official, and secret ballot. One account claims that the official ballot
   liberates dependent voters from the dictates of local elites, thereby
   enhancing democratic competition. Another argues that in contexts of
   widespread illiteracy, its adoption may be tantamount to a suffrage
   restriction. This article adjudicates between these views by drawing
   upon an original data set of municipal-level voting returns from
   Brazil's Second Republic (1945-1964). The unique staggered rollout of
   the official ballot during this period permits one to assess its impact
   with unprecedented accuracy. The article finds that the primary
   consequence of ballot reform was suffrage restriction. Rather than
   liberating poor and dependent voters, the official ballot made it
   exceedingly difficult for these individuals to vote. Moreover,
   parliamentary debates indicate that this was an anticipated and intended
   effect of the reform.

AB In electoral autocracies, opposition coalition formation offers the best
   hope of getting to democracy. Yet forming electoral coalitions also
   entails convincing opposition voters to ignore compromises and engage in
   the cross-party voting necessary for opposition victory. To what extent
   are voters committed to defeating the autocratic incumbent even if it
   would result in dislikable outcomes? A survey experiment in Malaysia
   finds that opposition voters overwhelmingly express pretreatment support
   for the opposition coalition. But when exposed to a treatment vignette
   about which member party might lead the next government, many voters
   retract their support. Specifically, voters' support for the coalition
   declines when their least preferred member is expected to control the
   government and when they can vote for a closer ideological alternative
   outside of the coalition. Although voters are committed to opposition
   unity and democratic transition, that commitment is sensitive to the
   anticipated consequences of an opposition victory.

AB We study the impact of the integration of women in U.S. policing between
   the late 1970s and early 1990s on violent crime reporting and domestic
   violence (DV). Along these two key dimensions, we find that female
   officers improved police quality. Crime victimization data reveal that
   as female representation increases among officers in an area, violent
   crimes against women in that area, and especially DV, are reported to
   the police at significantly higher rates. There are no such effects for
   violent crimes against men or from increases in the female share of
   civilian police employees. Furthermore, increases in female officer
   shares are followed by significant declines in rates of intimate partner
   homicide and non-fatal domestic abuse. These effects are all consistent
   between fixed effects models with controls for economic and policy
   variables and models that focus exclusively on increases in female
   police employment driven by externally imposed affirmative action plans

   consumer, purchases posterior beliefs at their prices using the prior
   distribution as her endowment. A single firm has the technology to
   garble the state. Welfare theorems provide a verification tool for
   optimality of a persuasion scheme and characterize the structure of

   level generates a downturn and worsened credit conditions. The key idea
   is that hiring inputs is risky because financial frictions limit firms'
   ability to insure against shocks. An increase in volatility induces
   firms to reduce their inputs to reduce such risk. Our model can generate
   most of the decline in output and labor in the Great Recession and the
   observed increase in firms' interest rate spreads.

   of shocks or from agents responding more to shocks of constant size.
   Without data separately measuring exogenous shocks and endogenous
   responses, a theoretical debate between these explanations has emerged.
   In this paper, we provide novel identification using price data in the
   open-economy environment: using confidential BLS microdata, we document
   a robust positive relationship between exchange rate pass-through and
   the dispersion of item-level price changes. We then show that this

AB We estimate the aggregate productivity gains from reducing barriers to

   and spatial differences in human capital. We distinguish between
   movement costs, which mean workers will move only if they expect higher
   wages, and amenity differences, which mean some locations must pay more
   to attract workers. We find modest but important aggregate impacts. We
   estimate a 22 percent increase in labor productivity from removing all
   barriers. Reducing migration costs to the US level, a high-mobility
   benchmark, leads to a 7.1 percent productivity boost. These figures hide
   substantial heterogeneity. The origin population that benefits most sees
   a 104 percent increase in average earnings from a complete barrier
   removal, or a 25 percent gain from moving to the US benchmark.

   Under collusion, bidding constraints weaken cartels by limiting the

   the counterintuitive prediction that introducing minimum prices can
   lower the winning-bid distribution. The model's predictions are borne
   out in Japanese procurement data, where we find evidence that minimum

AB As a result of the divorce revolution, more children grow up in complex
   families. Yet, we know little about how family complexity affects
   relationships when children are adults and parents are ageing. In this
   article, we use unique survey data to test fundamental ideas about
   intergenerational ties: the role of biology, partnerships (marriage and
   cohabitation), residence, and selection. The survey used a
   register-based oversample of Dutch adults who grew up in nonstandard
   families, collected data among adult children and their parent figures,
   and used a double multi-actor design in which adult children reported on
   their parents and parents reported on their children. Using random- and
   fixed-effects models, we confirm most hypotheses but the results are
   highly gendered. For fathers, we find evidence for a partnership premium
   and no disadvantage of being a stepparent once the length of residence
   is adjusted. For mothers, the partnership premium is weaker but the
   effect of biology is strong: stepmother-stepchild ties are much weaker,
   even after taking residence patterns into account. Biological mothers
   are the primary kinkeepers, and for fathers of any type, their
   relationship to children depends on their partnership to the biological
   mother. Within-family comparisons suggest that selection into divorce
   and remarriage do not explain these disadvantages.

AB Employing a comparative experimental design drawing on over 18,000
   interviews across eleven countries on four continents, this article
   revisits the discussion about the economic and cultural drivers of
   attitudes towards immigrants in advanced democracies. Experiments
   manipulate the occupational status, skin tone and national origin of
   immigrants in short vignettes. The results are most consistent with a
   Sociotropic Economic Threat thesis: In all countries, higher-skilled
   immigrants are preferred to their lower-skilled counterparts at all
   levels of native socio-economic status (SES). There is little support
   for the Labor Market Competition hypothesis, since respondents are not
   more opposed to immigrants in their own SES stratum. While skin tone
   itself has little effect in any country, immigrants from Muslim-majority
   countries do elicit significantly lower levels of support, and racial
   animus remains a powerful force.

AB In many developing countries the rural poor often depend on patrons to
   act as brokers in order to get public provision from the government. The
   broker facilitates provision in return for securing peasants' votes for
   politicians. Yet, low bargaining power of peasants allows patrons to
   appropriate public resources for themselves. I propose increasing
   peasants' bargaining power by connecting them to markets outside their
   village. Making use of a natural experiment found in the construction of
   a motorway in Pakistan, I find public provision to be significantly
   higher in connected villages when compared to those which are isolated.
   Moreover, I find that the beneficial impact of connectivity is felt most
   strongly by the lower classes, who are most vulnerable to exploitation
   when isolated.

AB Democratic rule is maintained so long as all relevant actors in the
   political system comply with the institutional rules of the game -
   democratic institutions must be self-enforcing. We examine the role of
   transparency in supporting a democratic equilibrium. Transparency
   improves the functioning of elections: in transparent polities,
   elections more effectively resolve adverse selection problems between
   the public and their rulers. Transparency increases popular satisfaction
   with democracy and inhibits challenges to the democratic order. We
   provide a game-theoretic model, test these claims, and find they enjoy
   empirical support. Transparency is associated with a reduction in both
   the probability of democratic collapse and of the irregular removal of
   democratic leaders. Transparency stabilizes democratic rule.

AB When political action entails individual costs but group-contingent
   benefits, political participation may depend on an individual's
   perceptions of others' beliefs; yet detailed empirical attention to
   these second-order beliefs - beliefs about the beliefs of others -
   remains rare. We offer the first comprehensive examination of the
   distribution and content of second-order climate beliefs in the United
   States and China, drawing from six new opinion surveys of mass publics,
   political elites and intellectual elites. We demonstrate that all
   classes of political actors have second-order beliefs characterized by
   egocentric bias and global underestimation of pro-climate positions. We
   then demonstrate experimentally that individual support for pro-climate
   policies increases after respondents update their second-order beliefs.
   We conclude that scholars should focus more closely on second-order
   beliefs as a key factor shaping climate policy inaction and that
   scholars can use the climate case to extend their understanding of
   second-order beliefs more broadly.

AB When citizens hold multiple values relevant to their policy opinions,

   value trade-off. Yet, it is unclear which individuals are able to manage
   their multiple values in these ways. We posit a
   sophistication-interaction theory of value pluralism where the most
   politically sophisticated individuals are able to reconcile the
   existence of multiple values, thus increasing the stability of their
   policy opinions. We test this hypothesis using a series of
   heteroskedastic graded item response theory models of public opinion
   toward policies related to climate change. We find that people structure
   their policy preferences toward climate change policies in values toward
   the environment and the economy, but only the most sophisticated
   citizens are able to reconcile the potential conflict between these

AB Mitigating climate change requires countries to provide a global public
   good. This means that the domestic cleavages underlying mass attitudes
   toward international climate policy are a central determinant of its
   provision. We argue that the industry-specific costs of emission
   abatement and internalized social norms help explain support for climate
   policy. To evaluate our predictions we develop novel measures of
   industry-specific interests by cross-referencing individuals' sectors of
   employment and objective industry-level pollution data and employing
   quasi-behavioral measures of social norms in combination with both
   correlational and conjoint-experimental data. We find that individuals
   working in pollutive industries are 7 percentage points less likely to
   support climate co-operation than individuals employed in cleaner
   sectors. Our results also suggest that reciprocal and altruistic
   individuals are about 10 percentage points more supportive of global
   climate policy. These findings indicate that both interests and norms
   function as complementary explanations that improve our understanding of
   individual policy preferences.

AB How do international institutions affect political liberalization in
   member states? Motivated by an examination of the World Bank loans
   program, this article shows that institutions can incentivize
   liberalization by offering opportunities for countries to become
   associated with advanced, wealthy members. In the World Bank, when a
   loan recipient reaches a specified level of economic development, it
   becomes eligible to graduate from borrower status to lender status.
   Using a regression discontinuity design, the study demonstrates that
   this incentive motivates states to improve their domestic behavior with
   respect to human rights and democracy. Combining qualitative and
   quantitative evidence, the results suggest that the desire to become a
   member of this elite group is responsible for motivating member states
   to reform due to the belief that such membership brings diffuse
   international and domestic benefits.

AB Preferences for redistribution and social spending are correlated with
   income and unemployment risk, but it is unclear how these relationships
   come about. I build a theory emphasizing that only large changes in
   economic circumstances provide the information and motivation needed for
   people to change their preferences. Stable long-run preferences are
   shaped mainly by early socialization, which includes economic and
   ideological influences from the family, and early labor market
   experiences. Enduring shocks, low intergenerational mobility and the
   tendency of left-wing parents to be poorer generate correlations between
   circumstances and preferences. Because preferences are stable, greater
   inequality may not increase aggregate support for redistribution.
   Support is found for the theory with panel data from Switzerland, using
   a range of empirical tests.

AB Issue ownership theory posits that when social welfare is electorally
   salient, left-wing parties gain public support by rhetorically
   emphasizing social welfare issues. There is less research, however, on
   whether left-wing governing parties benefit from increasing social
   welfare spending. That is, it is not known whether leftist governments
   gain from acting on the issues they rhetorically emphasize. This article
   presents arguments that voters will not react to governments' social
   welfare rhetoric, and reviews the conflicting arguments about how
   government support responds to social welfare spending. It then reports
   time-series, cross-sectional analyses of data on government support,
   governments' social welfare rhetoric and social welfare spending from
   Britain, Spain and the United States, that support the prediction that
   government rhetoric has no effects. The article estimates, however, that
   increased social welfare spending sharply depresses support for both
   left- and right-wing governments. These findings highlight a strategic
   dilemma for left-wing governments, which lose public support when they
   act on their social welfare rhetoric by increasing welfare spending.

   Drawing on recent methodological advancements in normative political

   suggesting three models: complicity, double effect and dirty hands. It
   considers this framework in the context of development aid, discussing
   the relevant considerations for donors in different cases. The article

AB This article examines the relationship between third-party actors and

   that war participants kill fewer civilians in war when their expectation
   of third-party punishment is high. Combatants will anticipate a high
   likelihood of third-party sanctions when their alliance and trade
   networks are dominated by third parties that have ratified international
   treaties prohibiting the intentional targeting of non-combatants. The
   study hypothesizes that war combatants kill fewer civilians in war as
   the strength of ratifiers within their alliance and trade networks
   increases. Quantitative tests on a dataset of all interstate wars from
   1900-2003 provide strong statistical and substantive support for this
   hypothesis.

AB The Treaty of Lisbon strengthened the role of national parliaments in
   the European Union. It introduced an 'early warning system', granting
   parliamentary chambers the right to reject legislative proposals by the
   European Commission. Previous studies assumed independence between the
   decisions of parliaments to reject a legislative proposal. We apply
   recent advances in inferential network analysis and argue that
   parliamentary vetoes are better explained by conceptualizing
   parliaments' veto actions as a temporal network. Network effects can be
   observed along the dimension of party families. Based on a new
   permutation approach, we find that parliaments with similar party
   majorities influence each other over the course of the decision period
   ('social influence'), rather than basing their decisions independently
   on joint prior partisanship ('selection').

   nationalization for 142 parties across twenty European countries. This

AB The recent spate of mass public shootings in the United States raises
   important questions about how these tragic events might impact mass
   opinion and public policy. Integrating research on focusing events,
   contextual effects and perceived threat, this article stipulates that
   residing near a mass shooting should increase support for gun control by
   making the threat of gun violence more salient. Drawing upon multiple
   data sources on mass public shootings paired with large-N survey data,
   it demonstrates that increased proximity to a mass shooting is
   associated with heightened public support for stricter gun control.
   Importantly, the results show that this effect does not vary by
   partisanship, but does vary as a function of salience-related event
   factors, such as repetition, magnitude and recency. Critically, the core
   result is replicated using panel data. Together, these results suggest a
   process of context-driven policy feedback between existing gun laws,
   egregious gun violence and demand for policy change.

AB The product composition of bilateral trade encapsulates complex
   relationships about comparative advantage, global production networks,
   and domestic politics. Despite the availability of product-level trade
   data, most researchers rely on either the total volume of trade or
   certain sets of aggregated products. In this article, we develop a new
   dynamic clustering method to effectively summarize this massive amount
   of product-level information. The proposed method classifies a set of
   dyads into several clusters based on their similarities in trade
   profile-the product composition of imports and exports-and captures the
   evolution of the resulting clusters over time. We apply this method to
   two billion observations of product-level annual trade flows. We show
   how typical dyadic trade relationships evolve from sparse trade to
   interindustry trade and then to intra-industry trade. Finally, we
   illustrate the critical roles of our trade profile measure in
   international relations research on trade competition.

AB We argue word embedding models are a useful tool for the study of
   culture using a historical analysis of shared understandings of social
   class as an empirical case. Word embeddings represent semantic relations
   between words as relationships between vectors in a high-dimensional
   space, specifying a relational model of meaning consistent with
   contemporary theories of culture. Dimensions induced by word differences
   (rich - poor) in these spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural
   meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects
   widely shared associations, which we validate with surveys. Analyzing
   text from millions of books published over 100 years, we show that the
   markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic
   transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural
   dimensions of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is
   education, which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its
   association with cultivated taste.

TI Do the most successful migrants emulate natives in well-being? The

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY

EA SEP 2019
PY 2019
AB A growing body of research has been focusing on the well-being
   consequences of migration, yet most of this has overlooked the fact that
   many migrants experience intragenerational social mobility alongside
   geographical mobility. Without accounting for the effect of social
   mobility in working life, the impact of geographical mobility on
   well-being cannot be clearly examined. This paper focuses on the most
   successful migrants, who have started from the bottom and have achieved
   upward social mobility in the course of their careers, and compares
   their well-being with that of native non-migrants who have experienced a
   similar intragenerational social mobility trajectory. The analysis is
   based on a recent national survey in China, which has a representative
   sample for both the overall population and migrants. Findings show that
   migrants, whether from an urban or rural origin, have better incomes but
   significantly lower levels of well-being than natives, even with a
   similar career advancement trajectory and the same destination class
   position. Further exploration shows that the well-being disadvantage of
   migrants is mainly due to institutional and sociocultural barriers,
   rather than to reward differentials in the labour market. This may have
   a wider implication for migrants across national borders.

   how a project's implementation affects elections and, conversely, how
   electoral considerations influence decisions about implementation. Under
   well-defined conditions, politicians will either implement projects that
   they do not like or delay projects that, absent electoral concerns, they
   would support. The model further reveals how the perceived benefits of
   holding office can impede the production of public goods about which
   there is broad consensus. And depending on facts about the program's

AB Negative elite and news media attention to Latino-relevant issues,
   particularly undocumented immigration, has dramatically increased in
   recent years, potentially stigmatizing attributes of Latinos such as
   immigration status and language use. Concomitantly, immigration policy
   changes were leading to widespread arrests and deportation of many
   Latinos. Herein, we ask two questions: First, to what extent do Latinos
   perceive and experience discrimination? Second, to what extent do
   immigration status, generational status, and language use moderate
   beliefs about discrimination? Using Pew National Survey of Latinos data,
   we find that Latino beliefs about the problem of discrimination is a
   decreasing function of "proximity" to the "canonical immigrant"-defined
   here as first-generation immigrants who are Spanish-language dominant.
   Further, we demonstrate that reported rates of victimization due to
   discrimination exhibit no clear pattern and are flat over time. We
   conclude by demonstrating that discrimination beliefs have significant
   implications for systemic trust, anxiety, and policy preferences.

AB Gaslighting-a type of psychological abuse aimed at making victims seem
   or feel "crazy," creating a "surreal" interpersonal environment-has
   captured public attention. Despite the popularity of the term,
   sociologists have ignored gaslighting, leaving it to be theorized by
   psychologists. However, this article argues that gaslighting is
   primarily a sociological rather than a psychological phenomenon.
   Gaslighting should be understood as rooted in social inequalities,
   including gender, and executed in power-laden intimate relationships.
   The theory developed here argues that gaslighting is consequential when
   perpetrators mobilize gender-based stereotypes and structural and
   institutional inequalities against victims to manipulate their
   realities. Using domestic violence as a strategic case study to identify
   the mechanisms via which gaslighting operates, I reveal how abusers
   mobilize gendered stereotypes; structural vulnerabilities related to
   race, nationality, and sexuality; and institutional inequalities against
   victims to erode their realities. These tactics are gendered in that
   they rely on the association of femininity with irrationality.
   Gaslighting offers an opportunity for sociologists to theorize
   under-recognized, gendered forms of power and their mobilization in
   interpersonal relationships.

EA SEP 2019
PY 2019
AB A case study in the sociology of ideas, this article refines the theory
   of 'discursive opportunities' to examine how intellectual claims cross
   national and linguistic boundaries to achieve public prominence despite
   lacking academic credibility. Theories of 'brainwashing' and 'mind
   control' originally began in the United States in the 1960s as a
   response to the growth of new religious movements. Decades later in
   Japan, claims that so-called 'cults' 'brainwashed' or 'mind controlled'
   their followers became prominent after March 1995, when new religion Aum
   Shinrikyo gassed the Tokyo subway using sarin, killing thirteen. Since
   then, brainwashing/mind control have both remained central in public
   discourse surrounding the 'Aum Affair' despite their disputed status
   within academic discourse. This article advances two arguments. Firstly,
   the transnational diffusion of brainwashing/mind control from the US to
   Japan occurred as a direct result of the 1995 Tokyo sarin attack, which
   acted as a 'discursive opportunity' for activists to successfully
   disseminate the theories in public debate. Secondly, brainwashing/mind
   control became successful in Japanese public discourse primarily for
   their normative content, as the theories identified 'brainwashing/mind
   controlling cults' as evil, violent and profane threats to civil
   society.

AB A growing body of research in sociology uses the concept of cultural
   schemas to explain how culture influences beliefs and actions. However,
   this work often relies on belief or attitude measures gleaned from
   survey data as indicators of schemas, failing to measure the cognitive
   associations that constitute schemas. In this article, we propose a
   concept-association-based approach for collecting data about
   individuals' schematic associations, and a corresponding method for
   modeling concept network representations of shared cultural schemas. We
   use this method to examine differences between liberal and conservative
   schemas of poverty in the United States, uncovering patterns of
   associations expected based on previous research. Examining the
   structure of schematic associations provides novel insights to
   long-standing empirical questions regarding partisan attitudes toward
   poverty. Our method yields a clearer picture of what poverty means for
   liberals and conservatives, revealing how different concepts related to
   poverty indeed mean fundamentally different things for these two groups.
   Finally, we show that differences in schema structure are predictive of
   individuals' policy preferences.

AB Informal discussion plays a crucial role in democracy, yet much of its
   value depends on diversity. We describe two models of political
   discussion. The purposive model holds that people typically select
   discussants who are knowledgeable and politically similar to them. The
   incidental model suggests that people talk politics for mostly
   idiosyncratic reasons, as by-products of nonpolitical social processes.
   To adjudicate between these accounts, we draw on a unique, multisite,
   panel data set of whole networks, with information about many social
   relationships, attitudes, and demographics. This evidence permits a
   stronger foundation for inferences than more common egocentric methods.
   We find that incidental processes shape discussion networks much more
   powerfully than purposive ones. Respondents tended to report discussants
   with whom they share other relationships and characteristics, rather
   than based on expertise or political similarity, suggesting that
   stimulating discussion outside of echo chambers may be easier than
   previously thought.

AB This study examines the link between self-rated health and two aspects
   of gender: an individual's gender identity, and whether strangers
   classify that person's voice as male or female. In a phone-based general
   health survey, interviewers classified the sex of transgender women (n =
   722) and transgender men (n = 446) based on assumptions they made after
   hearing respondents' voices. The flawed design of the original survey
   produced inconsistent sex classification among transgender men and
   transgender women respondents; this study repurposes these discrepancies
   to look more closely at the implications of voice-based gender
   classification for the health of transgender men and women. Average
   marginal effects from logistic regression models show transgender men
   who are classified as women based on their voices are more likely to
   report poor self-rated health compared to transgender men who are
   classified as men. Conversely, transgender women who are classified as
   men are less likely to report poor self-rated health than are
   transgender women who are classified as women. Additionally, Black
   transgender men are more likely than any other group to be classified
   inconsistently with their gender identity, suggesting a link between
   race/ethnicity and gender perception.

AB Conventional models of bargaining and reassurance under incomplete
   information assume that actors' behavioral signals are objectively
   cooperative or noncooperative. Even if actors are uncertain of each
   other's preferences, they know what types of actions the other will view
   as cooperative. Yet on many real-world issues, cooperation is
   subjective, and what constitutes a cooperative action is conditional on
   the receiver's preferences. We present a formal model showing that in
   these cases, two-sided incomplete information actually incentivizes
   honest behavior and facilitates credible signaling. Because uncertain
   senders do not know whether a particular action will be interpreted as
   cooperative, they have little incentive to misrepresent, and instead
   honestly pursue their true goals. Thus, where cooperation is subjective,
   mutual uncertainty is "offsetting," such that credible signals allow
   actors to quickly and accurately update their beliefs. We illustrate
   this logic through a case study of the Sino-Soviet split, and highlight
   the model's implications for contemporary U.S.-China relations.

AB Over the past 30 years, cities across the United States have adopted
   quality-of-life ordinances aimed at policing social marginality.
   Scholars have documented zero-tolerance policing and emerging tactics of
   therapeutic policing in these efforts, but little attention has been
   paid to 911 calls and forms of third-party policing in governing public
   space and the poor. Drawing on an analysis of 3.9 million 911 and 311
   call records and participant observation alongside police officers,
   social workers, and homeless men and women residing on the streets of
   San Francisco, this article elaborates a model of "complaint-oriented
   policing" to explain additional causes and consequences of policing
   visible poverty. Situating the police within a broader bureaucratic
   field of poverty governance, I demonstrate how policing aimed at the
   poor can be initiated by callers, organizations, and government
   agencies, and how police officers manage these complaints in
   collaboration and conflict with health, welfare, and sanitation
   agencies. Expanding the conception of the criminalization of poverty,
   which is often centered on incarceration or arrest, the study reveals
   previously unforeseen consequences of move-along orders, citations, and
   threats that dispossess the poor of property, create barriers to
   services and jobs, and increase vulnerability to violence and crime.

AB Much research in social science concludes that uncertainty surrounding

   that people are continuously searching for certainty. In the context of
   rising rates of religious disaffiliation in the United States, and the
   rise of social and political organizations created to promote
   nonreligious beliefs and values, the nonreligious offer a strategic case
   to explore the meaning and lived experience of certainty and uncertainty
   surrounding belief and identity formation. Drawing on an analysis of
   identity narratives from 50 nonreligious Americans, I find that
   uncertainty is just as often experienced as positive and motivating as
   it is isolating or anxiety-inducing, and although certainty-filled
   beliefs and identities are available for the nonreligious, they are just
   as often rejected for more uncertain ones. I reveal how some
   nonreligious individuals fluctuate between different orientations toward
   certainty and uncertainty regarding their nonreligion, whereas others
   exhibit more trait-like orientations to certainty and uncertainty. These
   findings have important implications for understanding how orientations
   to certainty and uncertainty shape identity and belief development in

AB How does land reform impact civil conflict? This article examines this

   event-level data from the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission
   on rural killings during Peru's internal conflict from 1980 to 2000.
   Using a geographic regression discontinuity design that takes advantage
   of Peru's regional approach to land reform through zones that did not
   entirely map onto major preexisting administrative boundaries, I find
   that greater land reform dampened subsequent conflict. Districts in core
   areas of land reform zones that received intense land reform witnessed
   less conflict relative to comparable districts in adjacent peripheral
   areas where less land reform occurred. Further tests suggest that land
   reform mitigated conflict by facilitating counterinsurgency and
   intelligence gathering, building local organizational capacity later
   used to deter violence, undercutting the Marxist left, and increasing
   opportunity costs to supporting armed groups.

AB In this article I revisit the relationship between war and state making
   in modern times by focusing on two prominent types of war finance: taxes
   and foreign loans. Financing war with tax money enhances the capacity to
   assess wealth and monitor compliance, namely fiscal capacity.
   Tax-financed war facilitates the adoption of power-sharing institutions,
   which transform taxation into a non-zero-sum game, carrying on the
   effect of war in the long run. Financing war with external capital does
   not contribute to long-term fiscal capacity if borrowers interrupt debt
   service and, as part of the default settlement, war debt is condoned or
   exchanged for nontax revenue. The empirical evidence draws from war
   around the world as early as 1816. Results suggest that globalization of
   capital markets in the nineteenth century undermined the association
   between war, state making, and political reform.

   expand interpersonal contact among their citizens. We apply a two-stage

   and highly disaggregated product-level trade data encompassing 131
   countries over a half century. Consistent with our model, we find that
   (a) political institutions matter for the extensive margin of trade but

   institutions on the extensive margin of trade vary across products,
   falling most heavily on those goods that involve extensive interpersonal

   endogenous economic growth to demonstrate that paths of both economic
   and political development over the long span of European history from
   1200 to 1900 are the consequence of a common process of urban
   agglomeration. In doing so, we provide evidence that both outcomes-the
   existence of constraining institutions and growth-are driven by initial
   conditions that fostered technical know-how embodied in urban-dwelling
   artisans who, in turn, were able to force institutional limits on

   Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) arbitrations and firm-level
   bilateral investment to show that, in fact, claimant investors reinvest
   in the host state at least 31 percent of the time (between 1990 and
   2015). Among investors who file for arbitration, and controlling for
   sector, important correlates of reinvestment include the claimant's
   legal strategy; the extent of the claimant's grievance and success; and
   the incidence of post-arbitration litigation. Despite unique aspects of
   its institutional design, the de facto international investment regime
   can help solve host state time-inconsistency problems consistent with
   standard expectations of law. Whether the probability of reinvestment is
   high enough to reinforce host state commitments to this controversial
   regime is an open question.

AB More than 3,000 international investment agreements (IIAs) provide
   foreign investors with substantive protections in host states and access
   to binding investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). In recent years,
   states increasingly have sought to change their treaty commitments
   through the practices of renegotiation and termination, so far affecting
   about 300 IIAs. The received wisdom is that this development reflects a
   "backlash" against the regime and an attempt by governments to reclaim
   sovereignty, consistent with broader antiglobalization trends. Using new
   data on the degree to which IIA provisions restrict state regulatory
   space (SRS), we provide the first systematic investigation into the
   effect of ISDS experiences on state decisions to adjust their treaties.
   The empirical analysis indicates that exposure to investment claims
   leads either to the renegotiation of IIAs in the direction of greater
   SRS or to their termination. This effect varies, however, with the
   nature of involvement in ISDS and with respect to different treaty
   provisions.

AB What type of trade agreement is the public willing to accept? Instead of
   focusing on individual concerns about market access and trade barriers,
   we argue that specific treaty design and, in particular, the
   characteristics of the dispute settlement mechanism, play a critical
   role in shaping public support for trade agreements. To examine this
   theoretical expectation, we conduct a conjoint experiment that varies
   diverse treaty-design elements and estimate preferences over multiple
   dimensions of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)
   based on a nationally representative sample in Germany. We find that
   compared to other alternatives, private arbitration, known as
   investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), generates strong opposition to
   the trade agreement. As the single most important factor, this effect of
   dispute settlement characteristic is strikingly large and consistent
   across individuals' key attributes, including skill levels, information,
   and national sentiment, among others.

AB Indiscriminate violence against civilians has long been viewed as a
   catalyst for new rounds of violence in civil wars. Can humanitarian
   assistance reduce violence after civilians have been harmed?
   Crossnational studies are pessimistic, drawing a connection between
   humanitarian aid and increased civil war violence, lethality, and
   duration. To date, however, we have few subnational studies of wartime
   aid and subsequent violence. To examine this relationship, I draw on the
   Afghan Civilian Assistance Program (ACAP II), a USAID-funded initiative
   that investigated 1,061 civilian casualty incidents (2011-13). Aid was
   assigned as if randomly to about half (55.8%) of these incidents,
   facilitating counterfactual estimation of how assistance affected
   Taliban attacks against the International Security Assistance Force,
   Afghan forces, and civilians. Challenging prior studies, I find that
   ACAP was associated with an average 23 percent reduction in attacks
   against ISAF, but not Afghan forces or civilians, at the village level
   for up to two years after the initial incident.

AB An analysis of adjudicated divorce decisions in two Chinese provinces
   reveals the extent to which and the reasons why Chinese courts subvert
   the global legal norms they symbolically embrace. In China, uncontested
   no-fault divorces are readily attainable outside the court system.
   Courts, by contrast, granted divorces in fewer than half of the cases
   they adjudicated. Despite an abundance of formal legal mechanisms
   designed to provide relief to victims of marital abuse, a plaintiff's
   claim of domestic violence did not increase the probability a court
   granted a divorce request. Chinese courts' highly institutionalized
   practice of denying first-attempt divorce petitions and granting
   divorces on subsequent litigation attempts disproportionately impacts
   women and has spawned a sizable population of female marital-violence
   refugees. These findings carry substantive and theoretical implications
   concerning the limits and possibilities of the local penetration of
   global legal norms.

AB This article draws on 11 months of multisite ethnographic fieldwork and
   103 interviews to investigate how teachers in school faculty of varying
   racial compositions form and use their social ties to secure
   professional, political, and emotional resources at work. Findings show
   that, in general, white teachers in the numerical minority in their
   schools secured all resource types through their same-race ties, while
   black teachers in the numerical minority secured primarily emotional
   resources from their same-race ties. Given these observed differences,
   the author shows how the form and use of the two minority groups' social
   ties stem in large part from distinctive organizational practices. In
   turn, the tie differences can account for differences in social
   integration and resource access in the organization. The data allow for
   comparisons to patterns among majority groups.

AB This article examines the structural conditions that shape ethnic
   boundary making in the school setting. While previous work has focused
   on the ethnic composition of student bodies, this study places schools
   in their institutional and local contexts. The authors argue that the
   formation of identities and networks varies across local areas depending
   on the extent of ethnic stratification across schools. Empirically, the
   authors turn to the case of Germany, where the role of schools as
   producers of categorical inequalities is particularly obvious. The
   analysis links large-scale survey data on adolescents' identification
   and networks with administrative geocoded information on local
   stratification across secondary schools. The authors find that minority
   students in schools with identical ethnic compositions show different
   inclinations to identify as a majority group member and to form
   friendships with majority peers, depending on the local extent of ethnic
   stratification across schools. To place these findings in a
   cross-national perspective, the authors identify scope conditions of
   these mechanisms of boundary making and discuss their presence in other
   countries and school systems. The results support recent theories of
   immigrant incorporation and offer a more contextualized understanding of
   ethnic boundary making in schools.

AB How courts make decisions during national emergencies has been a key
   focus of legal scholarship, yet we know comparatively little about how
   courts respond to national crises in one of their core
   functions-criminal sentencing. This article addresses this gap by
   leveraging the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, to examine the
   punishment of foreign nationals before and after a national emergency.
   Using difference-in-difference-in-differences estimation, this article
   finds little evidence that the severity of sentences for non-U.S.
   citizens changed appreciably nationwide. This article does find,
   however, considerable evidence of a more local 9/11 effect, whereby the
   sentencing gap between citizens and noncitizens widened significantly in
   the New York and Washington, D.C., District Courts following the
   attacks. Using restricted data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, this
   article finds suggestive evidence that the differences in sentencing
   following 9/11 are likely attributable to changes in judges' behavior,
   rather than policy shifts or changes in prosecutorial decisions.

AB This study advances understanding of gender pay gaps by examining
   organizational variation. The gender pay gap literature supplies
   mechanisms but does not attend to organizational variation; the gender
   and science literature provides insights on the role of masculinist
   culture in disciplines but misses pay gap mechanisms. A data set of
   federal workers allows comparison of men and women in the same jobs and
   workplaces. Agencies associated with traditionally masculine
   (engineering, physical sciences) and gender-neutral (biological,
   interdisciplinary sciences) fields differ. Pay-gap mechanisms vary:
   human capital differences explain a larger share in gender-neutral
   agencies, while at male-typed agencies men are frequently paid more than
   women within the same job. Although beyond the federal workers'
   standardized pay scale, some interdisciplinary agencies more often pay
   men off grade, leading to higher earnings for men. Our theory of
   organizational variation helps explain local agency variation and how
   pay practices matter in specific organizational contexts.

AB Is financialization contributing to the slow decline of union density
   that is occurring across most advanced capitalist countries? Combining
   insights from literatures on financialization, corporate governance, and
   comparative political economy, we argue that the growing dominance of
   finance within advanced capitalism weakens unions through several
   channels, and plays an important but underappreciated role in the
   deunionization of national workforces. Using data from 18 advanced
   capitalist countries over several decades, this assertion is tested
   against the literature's existing explanations for declining union
   density. Results from panel regression models suggest that
   financialization is an important cause of union decline, but that its
   particular effects vary between different types of advanced capitalism.
   The study concludes by arguing that financialization creates new
   interconnections between firms and finance capital, resulting in
   business practices that ultimately put downward pressure on union
   densities across advanced capitalist countries.

AB Social scientists have documented a substantial increase in both
   mothers' and fathers' time spent with children since the 1960s in the
   United States. Yet parenting behaviors remain deeply divided by social
   class and gender, with important implications for the reproduction of
   inequality. To understand rising parental investments in children and
   persistent class and gender differences in parenting, popular accounts
   and academic studies have pointed to an apparent cultural shift toward
   norms of time-intensive, child-centered parenting, particularly for
   mothers and among middle-class parents. However, prior research has
   produced inconclusive evidence relating to social class, gender, and
   contemporary parenting norms. Using data from an original vignette
   survey experiment conducted with a nationally representative sample of
   more than 3,600 parents, this study examines cultural norms related to
   parenting elementary school-aged children, considering how both social
   class and gender shape views about good parenting. Results indicate that
   parents of different social classes express remarkably similar support
   for intensive mothering and fathering across a range of situations,
   whether sons or daughters are involved. These findings suggest that
   cultural norms of child-centered, time-intensive mothering and fathering
   are now pervasive, pointing to high contemporary standards for parental
   investments in children.

AB An intriguing phenomenon consists in the fact that widespread support
   for democracy coexists in many countries with the persistent absence of
   democracy itself. Addressing this phenomenon, we show that in most
   places where it exists people understand democracy in ambiguous ways,
   such that "authoritarian" notions of what democracy means mix with-and
   even overshadow-liberal notions, in spite of the contradiction between
   these two notions. Underlining this contradiction, our evidence shows
   that authoritarian notions of democracy question the authenticity of
   liberal notions when both are endorsed conjointly. Worse, the evidence
   further suggests that authoritarian notions reverse the whole meaning of
   support for democracy, indeed indicating support for autocracy instead.
   Arguably, this reversal in the meaning of support for democracy lends
   legitimacy to authoritarian rule, which helps to explain where autocracy
   endures. Testing alternative explanations of authoritarian notions of
   democracy, we find that emancipative values are most influential,
   exerting a two-fold "enlightening" effect in (a) making people recognize
   the contradiction between liberal and authoritarian notions of democracy
   and (b) turning them against authoritarian notions. In a nutshell, the
   prospects of democracy are bleak where emancipative values remain weak.

AB Complementing the existing partisanship and income distribution
   literature that focuses on the earnings of all employees, this paper
   examines the effect of left government partisanship on top managers.
   Drawing on firm-level top executive compensation data across thirteen
   advanced industrialized countries, the paper shows that left government
   partisanship principally leads to lower CEO compensation, either through
   laws that enhance workers' collective bargaining power vis-a-vis
   management or laws that allow shareholders to cast proxy votes on
   executive compensation (i.e., say-on-pay laws). Furthermore, I show that
   left government partisanship reduces CEO pay more heavily in those firms
   that more strongly favor labor's competing stakeholders. In particular,
   left partisanship reduces executive compensation more heavily in firms
   that set aside more revenue for shareholders, managers, or creditors,
   that is, firms with higher asset return, stock return, or debt. These
   findings highlight how the macro-politics of rising top income
   inequality at the national level interacts with the micro-distributive
   conflicts at the firm level. In particular, financialization, such as
   the rise of the shareholder value revolution, may accentuate the impact
   of partisan politics against top income inequality.

AB Between-school ability tracking-the assignment of students to different
   school types based on their prior achievement-is usually associated with
   increased ethnic segregation across schools. This article argues that
   stronger between-school ability tracking is not only associated with
   stronger ethnic sorting into school types, thus increasing segregation.
   At the same time, it hampers majority flight, majority members'
   avoidance of exposure to minority members, thus decreasing segregation.
   To identify the two-fold effect of tracking the article exploits a
   unique feature of the German secondary school system: regional variation
   in the strength of between-school ability tracking. Analyses rely on
   administrative data entailing geocoded information on all secondary
   schools in Germany in 2008/2009. Results corroborate expectations of a
   two-fold effect: there is indication that between-school ability
   tracking increases segregation via more sorting into tracks while at the
   same time decreasing it via less school sorting within each track and
   via less spatial sorting. This suggests that school reforms changing
   tracked school systems into more comprehensive school systems may have a
   weaker desegregating impact than expected.

AB This research analyzes how living in concentrated poverty during
   adolescence affects future college outcomes. Using Add Health data and
   propensity score methods to explore effect heterogeneity, I find that
   concentrated poverty has little direct impact on college matriculation.
   It does, however, strongly reduce the odds of graduating from college
   for adolescents least likely to reside in concentrated poverty. This
   indicates an advantage-leveling model in which individuals with prior
   advantages have the most to lose from neighborhood disadvantage during
   adolescence. I assess neighborhood socialization, school effects, and
   peer effects as potential explanations for the neighborhood effect.
   Supporting collective socialization theory, neighborhood economic
   opportunity and resource deprivation are key aspects of
   poverty-saturated neighborhoods that influence college graduation odds.
   Schools also play an important role in the relationship between
   neighborhoods and college outcomes. Main effects are likely to be causal
   as they are highly robust to unobserved confounding.

AB Navigating the labor market in today's economy has become increasingly
   difficult for those without a college degree. In this study, we ask
   whether and how working-class men and women in the United States are
   able to secure gains in wages and/or earnings as they transition to
   parenthood or increase family size. We look closely at child parity,
   employment behavior (e.g., switching employers, taking on multiple jobs,
   increasing hours), and occupation in the year after the birth of a
   child. Using the 2004 and 2008 panels of the Survey for Income and
   Program Participation (SIPP), we employ fixed-effects models to examine
   the impact of changing labor market behavior or occupation on wages and
   earnings after the birth of a child. We find limited evidence that low-
   and middle-skill men experience a "fatherhood premium" after the birth
   of a child, conditional on child parity and occupation. For men, nearly
   all occupations were associated with a "wage penalty" after the birth of
   a child (parity varies) compared to the service sector. However, overall
   higher wages in many male-dominated and white-collar occupations make
   these better options for fathers. For women, we see clear evidence of a
   "motherhood penalty," which is partly accounted for by employment
   behaviors, such as switching to a salaried job or making an occupational
   change.

AB Women who migrate to the United States often face structural and
   cultural obstacles when joining the workforce. The US-born daughters of
   these women show considerable upward mobility, yet recent scholarship
   finds substantial variation in the employment of second-generation women
   by parental country of origin. This study assesses whether gender
   traditionalism in the parental country of origin has a persistent effect
   on the labor force participation of partnered second-generation women in
   the United States. An analysis of 1995-2015 Current Population Survey
   data supplemented with parental origin country characteristics finds
   that gender-traditional behaviors, religions, institutions, and
   attitudes are each associated with a lower likelihood of female labor
   force participation (FLFP). We propose that the successful
   intergenerational transmission of conservative cultural repertoires from
   the first to the second-generation accounts for these relationships.
   Conservative religious context is the best overall predictor of lowered
   second-generation FLFP. However, patriarchal attitudes and institutions
   in the parental birthplace best account for the participation of women
   with parental origins in Latin America and the Caribbean, while the
   effect of religious context is strongest among women with parental
   origins in Asia and Europe.

AB This study extends macro-structural research on international migration
   flows by going beyond conventional economic, demographic, and geographic
   explanations. Prior extensions suggest that migrants are drawn to places
   where welfare benefits are generous. I test the welfare magnet
   hypothesis while proposing an alternative explanation for migration: the
   prospect for inclusion. The analysis uses a comprehensive point-to-point
   migration dataset for a sample of robust welfare states, the
   universalist countries of Nordic Europe, and similarly positioned
   destinations representing other welfare types to examine destinations'
   commitments to inclusion, humanitarianism, and welfare generosity.
   Results reveal no evidence for a magnet effect to the most generous
   welfare states in the world net of other recognized factors, and even
   suggest a negative influence linked to the region's high cost of living.
   Migrants are instead drawn by the promise of social and political
   inclusion, migrating to destinations where co-ethnics have become
   full-fledged citizens. Additional evidence points to the role of
   international commitments to humanitarianism in augmenting flows.
   Findings integrate insights on contexts of immigrant reception with
   research on migration flows, thus contributing to a political sociology
   of immigration and citizenship and opening new avenues for research on
   the determinants of migration to newer, more distant locations.

   displacement, refugees mobilize their pre-conflict roles to secure
   self-rescue against forces of conflict. During resettlement, refugees
   assert their eligibility to exist and authority to act as "persons" in a
   reception context that challenges the normative authority of their
   pre-conflict social roles. Refugee-host interactions that affirm
   pre-conflict social roles provide the basis for shared trust and enhance

   incarceration relate to health. In the present study, we estimate the
   effect of timing of incarceration on mental health using panel data
   constructed from the Danish population registry. We exploit a 1994
   criminal justice reform as a natural experiment that created exogenous
   variation in the age at which offenders were first incarcerated: because
   of policy change, incarceration occurred earlier than it would have
   otherwise. For the three out of the four mental health outcomes assessed
   in the study- having undergone psychiatric treatment, being in therapy
   or consultation, and being charged with the possession of drugs-we found
   consistent support for the notion that earlier incarceration is more
   harmful. The study refines our understanding of the collateral
   consequences of incarceration and it is the first to provide
   quasi-experimental evidence for the mental health effects of timing of
   incarceration.

AB Although indigenous populations have been subjected to some of the worst
   forms of institutionalized oppression in the United States, little
   social science research has sought to understand the day-to-day
   ethnoracial biases that contemporary Native American populations face.
   Seeking to expand this knowledge, we present a theoretical framework of
   the cultural processes of ethnoracial disadvantage experienced by Native
   American students in predominantly white colleges. Drawing on 65
   in-depth interviews with 50 Native students, we identify four cultural
   processes of disadvantage: derogatory stereotyping, exoticized othering,
   delegitimation, and assimilation pressures related to cultural hegemony.
   Intertwined with these processes is the cultural permissibility of
   ignorance, a willful dearth of knowledge- and lack of accountability for
   knowledge-about indigenous peoples, traditions, and histories of
   oppression which enable these biases and exclusions. Students tend to
   respond to these cultural processes of disadvantage in three ways:
   educating others, working to disprove stereotypes, and spanning two
   worlds. We end by discussing how these results help advance theoretical
   understanding of ethnoracial bias toward indigenous populations and
   cultural processes of ethnoracial inequality in the United States more
   broadly.

AB Under what conditions is ethical consumption a high-status practice?
   Using unique food consumption survey data on aesthetic and ethical
   preferences, we investigate how these orientations to food are related.
   Existing research on high-status food consumption points to the
   "foodie," who defines good taste through aesthetic standards. And
   emergent evidence suggests the "ethical consumer," whose consumption is
   driven by moral principles, may also be a high-status food identity.
   However, ethical consumption can be practiced in inexpensive and
   subcultural ways that do not conform to dominant status hierarchies
   (e.g., freeganism). In order to understand the complex cultural terrain
   of high-status consumption, we investigate how socioeconomic status
   (SES) is related to foodie and ethical consumer preferences and
   practices. Using a k-means cluster analysis of intercept survey data
   from food shoppers in Toronto, we identify four distinct clusters
   representing foodies, ethical consumers, ethical foodies, and those
   whose preferences involve neither aesthetic nor ethical ideals. Through
   multinomial logistic regression, we find that while high-status
   consumers can be foodies or ethical consumers, the highest status
   consumers prioritize ethical and foodie preferences. Respondents'
   reported shopping locations corroborate the results of the regression
   analyses. The taste preferences of the highest status consumers are
   associated with culinary sophistication and moral considerations,
   suggesting that high cultural capital tastes incorporate aesthetic and
   ethical dimensions. These results contribute to literature examining how
   food consumption repertoires can produce and reinforce classed
   boundaries and to literature on tastes that has focused on aesthetics to
   the neglect of ethical ideals.

AB How do protest actions succeed in winning public support? In this paper,
   I theorize how features of protest can persuade citizens to support
   demonstrators. In particular, I argue that broadcasting an attractive
   collective identity by means of diverse, worthy, united, numerous and
   committed participants (dWUNC) triggers supportive reactions of
   observers through increasing identification with protesters. I test this
   argument by exposing respondents to manipulated television news items of
   a protest event in two video vignette experiments. Study 1 scrutinizes
   the effect of dWUNC displays in an asylum seeker demonstration on a
   sample of Belgian citizens. Study 2 replicates this design in the US for
   the Black Lives Matter issue of police brutality. Both studies show
   predispositions of citizens to strongly affect favorability towards
   protesters. On top of these potent receiver effects, however, also the
   dWUNC features prove persuasive. In both experiments, a consistent
   pattern of feature effects is found: demonstrations that mobilized more
   diverse participants, who behaved worthy and acted in unison, elicited
   more supportive reactions. Study 2 adds that these protest feature
   effects are in part mediated by increasing identification with the
   demonstrators. The heterogeneity of protest feature effects is explored.

AB Paid work has become more precarious in the recent decades, prompting
   many conflicts between employers and employees, including struggles over
   work hours. To better understand these struggles, we provide the first
   examination of long-term experiences with work hour mismatches (i.e.,
   gaps between the number of hours people prefer to work per week and the
   number of hours they actually work). Using sequence analysis and nearly
   two decades of data from the British Household Panel Study, we find
   heterogeneous but patterned experiences. Nearly everyone has an hour
   mismatch eventually (typically overemployment), and most people
   oscillate between having and not having hour mismatches. Existing
   theoretical accounts anticipate some hour mismatch sequences, but the
   data contradict several key predictions. Moreover, no account predicts
   the most dominant pattern: oscillating overemployment. We thus offer a
   new explanation, which proposes that hour mismatches usually come in
   waves but can be generated in different ways. Sometimes mismatches are
   caused by unstable work schedules. Other times, mismatches stem from
   inflexible work hours or job demands that intentionally or
   unintentionally prevent employees from altering their work hours to
   accommodate changing personal needs.

   have changed differently across groups, the change in the occupational
   distribution since 1960 suggests that a substantial pool of innately
   talented women and black men in 1960 were not pursuing their comparative
   advantage. We examine the effect on aggregate productivity of the
   convergence in the occupational distribution between 1960 and 2010
   through the prism of a Roy model. Across our various specifications,
   between 20% and 40% of growth in aggregate market output per person can

AB Entrants and incumbents can create new products and displace the

   products. How much of aggregate productivity growth occurs through each
   of these channels? Using data from the U.S. Longitudinal Business
   Database on all nonfarm private businesses from 1983 to 2013, we arrive
   at three main conclusions: First, most growth appears to come from
   incumbents. We infer this from the modest employment share of entering
   firms (defined as those less than 5 years old). Second, most growth
   seems to occur through improvements of existing varieties rather than
   creation of brand new varieties. Third, own-product improvements by
   incumbents appear to be more important than creative destruction. We
   infer this because the distribution of job creation and destruction has
   thinner tails than implied by a model with a dominant role for creative
   destruction.

AB Can participation in financial markets lead individuals to reevaluate
   the costs of conflict, change their political attitudes, and even their
   votes? Prior to the 2015 Israeli elections, we randomly assigned
   Palestinian and Israeli financial assets to likely voters and
   incentivized them to actively trade for up to 7 weeks. No political
   messages or nonfinancial information were included. The treatment
   systematically shifted vote choices toward parties more supportive of
   the peace process. This effect is not due to a direct material incentive
   to vote a particular way. Rather, the treatment reduces opposition to
   concessions for peace and changes awareness of the broader economic
   risks of conflict. While participants who were assigned Palestinian
   assets are more likely to associate their assets' performance with

AB We obtain a recursive formulation for a general class of optimization
   problems with forward-looking constraints which often arise in economic
   dynamic models, for example, in contracting problems with incentive
   constraints or in models of optimal policy. In this case, the solution
   does not satisfy the Bellman equation. Our approach consists of studying
   a recursive Lagrangian. Under standard general conditions, there is a
   recursive saddle-point functional equation (analogous to a Bellman
   equation) that characterizes a recursive solution to the planner's
   problem. The recursive formulation is obtained after adding a co-state
   variable mu(t) summarizing previous commitments reflected in past
   Lagrange multipliers. The continuation problem is obtained with mu(t)
   playing the role of weights in the objective function. Our approach is
   applicable to characterizing and computing solutions to a large class of
   dynamic contracting problems.

AB We analyze financial markets in which agents face differential
   constraints on the set of assets in which they can trade. In particular,
   the assets available to each agent span a partition of the state space
   that can be strictly coarser than the partition spanned by the assets
   available in the market. We first show that the existence of
   differential constraints has an impact on prices and allocations as
   compared to a complete financial market with unconstrained agents. We
   consider the implications for survival, taking the work of Blume and
   Easley (2006) as a starting point. We show that whenever agents have
   identical correct beliefs and equal discount factors, and their
   partitions are nested, all agents survive. When agents have
   heterogeneous beliefs, differential constraints may allow agents with
   wrong beliefs to survive. Provided constraints are relevant (in a sense
   we define more precisely), the condition for an agent to survive is that
   his survival index is at least as large as that of the agents with finer
   partitions. We also study the impact of deregulation (an increase in the
   set of assets available to some agents). Unless the agent can adopt
   beliefs that are closer to the truth on the newly refined partition than
   those of less constrained agents, increasing his opportunities for trade
   might harm his chances for survival.

AB This article examines the narrative strategies through which Polish
   migrants in the UK challenge the formal rights of political membership
   and attempt to redefine the boundaries of 'citizenship' along notions of
   deservedness. The analysed qualitative data originate from an online
   survey conducted in the months before the 2016 EU referendum, and the
   narratives emerge from the open-text answers to two survey questions
   concerning attitudes towards the referendum and the exclusion of
   resident EU nationals from the electoral process. The analysis
   identifies and describes three narrative strategies in reaction to the
   public discourses surrounding the EU referendum - namely discursive
   complicity, intergroup hostility and defensive assertiveness - which
   attempt to redefine the conditions of membership in Britain's 'ethical
   community' in respect to welfare practices. Examining these processes
   simultaneously 'from below' and 'from outside' the national political
   community, the paper argues, can reveal more of the transformation
   taking place in conceptions of citizenship at the sociological level,
   and the article aims to identify the contours of a 'neoliberal
   communitarian citizenship' as internalized by mobile EU citizens.

AB Following the UK's EU referendum in June 2016, there has been
   considerable interest from scholars in understanding the characteristics
   that differentiate Leave supporters from Remain supporters. Since Leave
   supporters score higher on conscientiousness but lower on neuroticism
   and openness, and given their general proclivity toward conservatism, we
   hypothesized that preference for realistic art would predict support for
   Brexit. Data on a large nationally representative sample of the British
   population were obtained, and preference for realistic art was measured
   using a four-item binary choice test. Controlling for a range of
   personal characteristics, we found that respondents who preferred all
   four realistic paintings were 15-20 percentage points more likely to
   support Leave than those who preferred zero or one realistic paintings.
   This effect was comparable to the difference in support between those
   with a degree and those with no education, and was robust to controlling
   for the respondent's party identity.

AB This paper makes the case for cross-domain comparison as an
   undertheorized form of comparative analysis. The units of analysis in
   such comparisons are not (as in most comparative analysis) predefined
   units within a domain or system of formally similar yet substantively
   different categories or entities; they are the domains or systems of
   categorically organized differences themselves. Focusing on domains of
   categorical difference that are central to the contemporary politics of
   difference, we consider two examples of cross-domain comparison. The
   first compares sex/gender and race/ethnicity as systems of ascribed
   identities that are increasingly, yet to differing degrees and in
   differing ways, open to choice and change. The second compares religion
   and language as domains of categorically organized cultural difference
   that are centrally implicated in the politics of cultural pluralism. We
   situate these cross-domain comparisons, premised on a logic of
   'different differences', between generalizing and particularizing
   approaches to the politics of difference, arguing that these domains are
   similar enough to make comparison meaningful yet different enough to
   make comparison interesting. We outline five analytical focal points for
   cross-domain comparison: the criteria of membership and belonging, the
   categorical versus gradational structure of variation within domains of
   difference, the consolidation or proliferation of categories of
   difference, the procedures for dealing with mixed or
   difficult-to-classify instances, and the relation between categories of
   difference and the production and reproduction of inequality. We
   conclude by considering several potential objections to cross-domain
   comparison.

AB This article argues that in order to analyse democracy as a pattern
   constantly processed in a given society, it is useful to look at
   activist groups' agenda setting and recruitment principles, group bonds
   and boundaries, and how these actions direct and influence ways of
   creating the common. Based on an ethnographic study on bicycle activism
   in Helsinki, Finland, it describes a local critical mass movement that
   was successful in promoting a bicycle friendly and sustainable city, yet
   dissolved due to lack of people involved, and the bicycle demonstrations
   stopped at a moment of high public interest. This empirical puzzle is
   addressed by combining three theoretical perspectives: Kathleen Blee's
   work on path dependencies in nascent activist groups; Nina Eliasoph and
   Paul Lichterman's work on group styles, and Laurent Thevenot's work on
   the grammars of commonality. These theoretical tools help understand the
   sense of what is deemed possible, desirable and feasible in activist
   groups, and the consequences thereof to social movement 'success' and
   'failure'. The article claims that everyday practices and interaction
   are crucial in understanding the 'democratic effects' of social
   movements. It concludes that following specific processes of
   politicization and their conditionings in activist groups provides keys
   to understanding contextual differences in democracies without resorting
   to methodological nationalism or to exaggerated global isomorphism, and
   thus may contribute to figuring out how to succeed global action plans
   over wicked, pressing problems like global warming.

AB Individual actors have the potential to shape political outcomes through
   creative use of opportunities. Political entrepreneurship identifies how
   such actors recognize and exploit opportunities, for personal or

   operating within institutional settings, with less attention paid to
   other types of actors. In this article, I argue for an expansion of the
   political entrepreneurship framework, by considering individuals in the
   electoral and protest arenas. An examination of the field of Maori
   sovereignty, or tino rangatiratanga, in Aotearoa New Zealand allows
   exploration of prominent actors' innovative strategies and practices.
   The findings highlight the actors' reliance on identity in mobilizing
   support within the community, to press claims. Broadening the
   application of political entrepreneurship demonstrates the roles of
   social, cultural and political capital in influencing outcomes, by
   identifying opportunities available to individuals embedded in the

AB Adding to the literature on non-institutional political action and
   trust, this article argues that the loss of institutional trust is not
   only a cause but also an outcome of political activism. Studying the
   Danish refugee solidarity movement in a mixed-methods research design
   including survey and qualitative interview data, the article shows that
   three kinds of activism - political activism, humanitarian activity, and
   civil disobedience - relate differently to the loss of trust in the
   institutions of the Parliament, the legal system, and the police.
   Political activism primarily affects a loss of trust in the Parliament
   due to low external efficacy and a closed political opportunity
   structure. Civil disobedience affects a loss of trust in the legal
   system and the police due to a perceived lack of procedural justice.
   Humanitarian activity does not affect a loss of institutional trust
   because it does not imply interaction with the institutions to the same
   extent as the other kinds of activism. The consequence of losing trust
   in the political institutions is not an abandonment of democratic
   values, nor political apathy, but rather a change in civic engagement
   from a mode of democratically legitimizing participation in the
   institutions to a mode of contending and questioning the legitimacy of
   the political institutions. This finding indicates that in turn loss of
   institutional trust may cause an increase in extra-institutional
   political action which is consistent with the commonly assumed causality
   in the literature. This leads to a final integrating argument for
   conceptualizing activism and loss of institutional trust as reinforcing
   factors in a process where, in line with the main finding of this study,
   activism may cause a loss of institutional trust which, in turn, may
   cause additional activism, as argued in the existing literature.

AB This article contributes to denationalizing Bourdieu's field theory by
   analysing the relationship between a regional news media field, the
   state and transnational influences. The article seeks to answer the
   question of how a state can impose limits on the autonomy of the news
   media field during political transition. Field theory is applied to
   changes that have taken place in Crimean news media since Russia's
   annexation of the peninsula in 2014. Drawing on narrative interviews
   with journalists who worked in Crimea in 2012-17, expert interviews, and
   secondary sources, I demonstrate how Crimea's news media field went from
   being dominated by varied Ukrainian private news media owners to
   becoming dominated by the Russian state. I show that states can employ
   direct measures such as anti-press violence and ownership appropriation
   of news media outlets in order to increase concentration of state media
   ownership. In addition, states can reallocate capital in the news media
   field, disenfranchising some journalists and outlets while favouring
   others. The adaptive strategies of individual journalists, who, upon
   losing capital, can sometimes relocate or leave their jobs, also changes
   the composition of news media fields. Departing from a common view of
   social spaces as bounded within nation-states, I examine how the news
   media field of Crimea has been shaped by both transnational influences,
   and by the direct imposition of Russian state power through a
   reconstitution of national borders.

   capturing both hierarchical and horizontal forms of educational
   differentiation. Taking advantage of rich Danish population data, we
   apply log-linear models that include four ways of measuring educational

   (five aggregated levels), (c) by field of study (16 categories), and (d)
   by a disaggregated micro-educational classification, combining levels
   and fields of study (54 groups). Our results show declines in
   educational homogamy from 1984 to 2013, but the odds ratios of being
   educationally homogamous at the university college and university levels
   remain of substantial magnitude, by both the macro- and
   micro-educational measures. The micro-educational classification
   outperforms all other measures in explaining the associations in the
   homogamy tables. The income measure ('returns to education') does a
   particularly poor job of explaining homogamy patterns from 1984 to 2013.

   opportunities and formulates a conceptual model to link separate lines
   of research. Our particular focus is on combining motivational and
   structural approaches into a mediation model that explains differences
   in academic achievement. In the literature, four main mechanisms of
   social reproduction are discussed. Two main pathways refer to (1)
   parents' expectations regarding their children's academic success and
   (2) replicating cultural capital through intra-familial cultural
   practices. (3) Parents' perception of children's abilities depends on
   social position and is influential for expectations of success. (4) For
   all three pathways, we expect effects on students' motivational
   characteristics, which in turn influence academic achievement. We test
   our conceptual model by structural equation modelling using longitudinal
   data from primary school students in Germany. Empirical evidence is in
   line with the assumptions in the model. Cultural reproduction and
   expectations of success can be seen as the key components of the model.
   However, both chains of reproduction are related to each other by
   parents' perception of child's ability, and their effects are mediated
   by child's motivational characteristics.

   This paper addresses the relationship of mandated community service to
   one of its purported aims: subsequent volunteerism. It compares current
   volunteerism among four university student cohorts: those doing no
   service in secondary school, those volunteering with no requirement,
   those volunteering both before and after the introduction of a
   requirement, and those introduced to service through a requirement. The
   analysis indicates that (1) students who were introduced to service
   through a mandated programme exhibit current levels of engagement no
   greater than non-volunteers; (2) this relationship stems largely from
   the different service experiences of our four cohorts and relates to the
   fact that service satisfaction and duration, as well as background
   variables account for current levels of civic engagement. The findings
   suggest that mandatory service programmes might well be failing the very
   population they seek to target, particularly in weaker, less structured
   programmes.

AB The degree of social reproduction varies considerably between
   industrialized countries, raising the question of which institutional
   regulations promote or restrict this process. Education is considered
   the main mediator of social reproduction. Because school tracking - the
   sorting of children according to ability and interest at different ages
   - is known to affect educational attainment and the degree of tracking
   varies strongly across countries, it may thus account for differences in
   social reproduction. However, empirical studies are scarce, and the
   total impact of tracking on social reproduction remains ambiguous. Using
   the European Social Survey (ESS) 2012 and 2014 from 24 countries, we
   demonstrate that school tracking is strongly associated with higher
   degrees of social reproduction. Decomposing the process of social
   reproduction into educational inheritance, educational returns and
   direct effects of social origin, we find that although all channels
   contribute to social reproduction, the impact of tracking seems to be
   exerted through educational inheritance and to a similar degree through
   direct effects of social origin, whereas educational returns do not seem
   to be affected. Even net of educational attainment, social origin thus
   has a stronger effect on social status in tracked systems. We ascribe
   this effect to differences in qualitative choices within educational
   tracks, such as fields of study.

AB By employing a Bourdieu-inspired class scheme that differentiates
   between classes' volume and composition of capital, and by analysing
   Norwegian administrative register data for birth cohorts between 1987
   and 1992, this paper examines the relationship between social class
   background and gender-(a)typical choices of higher education. Fields of
   study in higher education in much of the Western world remain segregated
   by gender despite the gender gap in educational attainment having been
   reversed. However, some changes have taken place due to the influx of
   women into male-dominated, high-status fields. Few recent studies have
   examined the relationship between social class background and gendered
   educational choices in light of these changes; furthermore, the focus of
   previous research has been limited to the vertical dimension of class.
   The results presented in this article suggest that men and women are
   more likely to make gender-atypical choices when this leads to social
   mobility and that focusing solely on the vertical dimension of class may
   mask horizontal differences.

AB The symbolic value of being recruited by a high status multinational
   company likely represents an important marker of distinction. For the
   first time, a unique Destinations of Leavers in Higher Education (DLHE)
   data-set is used here to model entry to elite multinational company in
   finance, accountancy and consultancy sectors among graduates of
   different social origins, universities, degree subjects and with
   different degree classifications. From a sample of 11,755 graduates
   working across these three sectors, we examine what predicts entry to 31
   leading firms and then examine pay hierarchies among the 3,260 graduates
   working for these companies using random-effects models. At first
   glance, significantly, we find that elite recruits come from a much
   broader range of universities than might be imagined. However, a closer
   look at the highest paid graduates within these firms reveals more
   familiar patterns of social and institutional stratification. We argue
   that these patterns likely reflect the nature of work undertaken by
   graduates in these elite firms, with institutional and social origins of
   graduates differing according to the particular track taken in what are
   likely to be highly differentiated graduate recruitment schemes.

AB We address a largely neglected issue in contemporary research on
   cultural class divisions: economic capital and its associated lifestyles
   and symbolic expressions. Using qualitative interviews, we explore how
   adolescents from wealthy elite backgrounds, namely students at Oslo
   Commerce School (OCS), traditionally one of the most prestigious
   upper-secondary schools in Norway, demarcate themselves symbolically
   from others. They draw symbolic boundaries against students at other
   elite schools in Oslo, more characterized by backgrounds with high
   cultural capital, accusing them of mimicking a 'hipster' style. Within
   the OCS student body, we describe identity work centring on styles of
   material consumption and bodily distinctions. The most salient dividing
   line is between those who manage to master a 'natural' style, where
   expensive clothes and the desired bodily attributes are displayed
   discreetly, and those who are 'trying too hard' and thus marked by the
   stigma of effort. We also show some interesting intersections between
   class and gender: girls aspiring to the economic elite obey the 'rules
   of the game' by exercising extensive control over their bodies and
   adhering to demanding bodily norms for their weight and slimness. Such
   rules are less evident among the boys, where a lack of discipline,
   unruliness, hard partying and even fighting constitute parts of the
   lifestyle valued. This article contributes to the field of cultural
   stratification, highlighting the importance of the 'hows' of material
   consumption when expressing elite distinction. It also adds new insight
   to the research field of elite education by showing how a mastery of
   'high-end' consumer culture is involved in fostering favourable
   dispositions at elite schools.

AB Globalization poses many challenges for national cultural unity,
   especially in Europe. Some doubt whether national cultures will be able
   to survive, but there are many counter-trends pushing to maintain
   national cultural unity. I analyse the dual trends of global diversity
   and maintaining unity through an everyday manifestation of French
   culture: elementary school lunches. French school lunch programmes are
   part of the nation-building process because they are designed to teach
   students how to eat, which is especially important in France where the
   art of gastronomy is a key source of identity and pride. I analyse
   cultural influences on over 11,000 school lunch menu items from eight
   municipalities across two French regions. I also conduct in-depth
   face-to-face interviews with the people who design and approve school
   lunch menus. My inquiry is guided by three key questions. First, to what
   extent are foreign influences included? Second, does openness to foreign
   influences vary across different parts of France? Finally, how are
   foreign cultures represented? My results suggest that foreign cultures
   are deployed to nationalize difference. The limited foreign influences
   that appear in school lunches are strategically chosen to appeal to and
   to educate students, but in a way that reinforces the centrality of
   traditional French cultural norms. This article contributes to our
   understanding of the tension between national culture and a globalizing
   world.

AB There is a long academic tradition which positions the desire for
   authenticity as emerging as a symptom of dissatisfactions with
   modernity. Most recently, this has involved consumption of products that
   are valued for being authentic in contrast to mass produced commodities
   which are seen as being homogeneous, standardized and therefore
   inauthentic. A recent resurgence in interest in the idea of craft and
   craftwork has brought to the fore concerns about re-establishing
   connections between products, consumers and producers beyond rational
   market exchange. This research draws on interviews with 40 craft brewery
   and distillery workers to explore the ways in which authenticity is
   narrated as part of an ongoing effort to add value to their products and
   the contexts of their production. The article identifies six modes of
   authenticity which are drawn on in combination by participants to
   establish a narrative of authenticity. This is understood to be a clear
   illustration of the 'enrichment process' by which post-industrial
   economies manufacture value. A central element of craft drink producers'
   work is the marshalling of cultural value and engaging in communicative
   and performative acts that ascribe that value to products and the people
   involved in making them.

AB This article develops a novel account of middle-range theories for
   combining theoretical and empirical analysis in explanatory sociology. I
   first revisit Robert K. Merton's original ideas on middle-range theories
   and identify a tension between his developmental approach to
   middle-range theorizing that recognizes multiple functions of theories
   in sociological research and his static definition of the concept of
   middle-range theory that focuses only on empirical testing of theories.
   Drawing on Merton's ideas on theorizing and recent discussions on
   mechanism-based explanations, I argue that this tension can be resolved
   by decomposing a middle-range theory into three interrelated and
   evolving components that perform different functions in sociological
   research: (i) a conceptual framework about social phenomena that is a
   set of interrelated concepts that evolve in close connection with
   empirical analysis; (ii) a mechanism schema that is an abstract and
   incomplete description of a social mechanism; and (iii) a cluster of all
   mechanism-based explanations of social phenomena that are based on the
   particular mechanism schema. I show how these components develop over
   time and how they serve different functions in sociological theorizing
   and research. Finally, I illustrate these ideas by discussing Merton's
   theory of the Matthew effect in science and its more recent applications
   in sociology.

AB Using worldwide data from the World Values Survey (WVS) gathered in
   2010-2014, we examine two distinct ways in which Islam may be associated
   with women's employment. We show that, within their countries, Muslim
   women are less likely to be employed than women of other religions. We
   also examine between-country differences and find that, net of education
   and family statuses, the employment levels of women living in countries
   that are 90-100 per cent Muslim are not significantly different than
   those living in countries that are only 0-20 per cent Muslim. Then we
   test a prevailing view: that Islam discourages gender egalitarian
   values, and that these values - held by women themselves or people
   around them - explain why Muslim women are less likely to be employed
   than women of other religions within their own countries. Despite the
   rich measures of values in the WVS and a large sample, we find no
   evidence that values explain any of the lower employment of Muslim
   women, mainly because values have little or no effect on women's
   employment. Thus, we conclude that most of the world's gap in employment
   between Muslim women and other women is within-country and is not
   explained by gender ideology. Future research should examine alternative
   hypotheses, including ethno-religious discrimination.

AB It has been well established that those working in the sex industry are
   at various risks of violence and crime depending on where they sell sex
   and the environments in which they work. What sociological research has
   failed to address is how crime and safety have been affected by the
   dynamic changing nature of sex work given the dominance of the internet
   and digital technologies, including the development of new markets such
   as webcamming. This paper reports the most comprehensive findings on the
   internet-based sex market in the UK demonstrating types of crimes
   experienced by internet-based sex workers and the strategies of risk
   management that sex workers adopt, building on our article in the
   British Journal of Sociology in 2007. We present the concept of 'blended
   safety repertoires' to explain how sex workers, particularly independent
   escorts, are using a range of traditional techniques alongside digitally
   enabled strategies to keep themselves safe. We contribute a deeper
   understanding of why sex workers who work indoors rarely report crimes
   to the police, reflecting the dilemmas experienced. Our findings
   highlight how legal and policy changes which seek to ban online adult
   services advertising and sex work related content within online spaces
   would have direct impact on the safety strategies online sex workers
   employ and would further undermine their safety. These findings occur in
   a context where aspects of sex work are quasi-criminalized through the
   brothel keeping legislation. We conclude that the legal and policy
   failure to recognize sex work as a form of employment, contributes to
   the stigmatization of sex work and prevents individuals working
   together. Current UK policy disallows a framework for employment laws
   and health and safety standards to regulate sex work, leaving sex
   workers in the shadow economy, their safety at risk in a quasi-legal
   system. In light of the strong evidence that the internet makes sex work
   safer, we argue that decriminalisation as a rights based model of
   regulation is most appropriate.

AB The nature and role of social groups is a central tension in sociology.
   On the one hand, the idea of a group enables sociologists to locate and
   describe individuals in terms of characteristics that are shared with
   others. On the other, emphasizing the fluidity of categories such as
   gender or ethnicity undermines their legitimacy as ways of classifying
   people and, by extension, the legitimacy of categorization as a goal of
   sociological research. In this paper, we use a new research method known
   as the Imitation Game to defend the social group as a sociological
   concept. We show that, despite the diversity of practices that may be
   consistent with self-identified membership of a group, there are also
   shared normative expectations - typically narrower in nature than the
   diversity displayed by individual group members - that shape the ways in
   which category membership can be discussed with, and performed to,
   others. Two claims follow from this. First, the Imitation Game provides
   a way of simultaneously revealing both the diversity and 'groupishness'
   of social groups. Second, that the social group, in the
   quasi-Durkheimian sense of something that transcends the individual,
   remains an important concept for sociology.

AB Whether within an atmosphere of hope, or amidst relations of fear, the
   emotions of cancer are unavoidably collectively produced. Yet persistent
   individualistic paradigms continue to obscure how the emotions of cancer
   operate relationally - between bodies, subjects, discourses, and
   practices - and are intertwined with circulating beliefs, cultural
   desires, and various forms of normativity. Drawing on interviews with 80
   people living with cancer in Australia, this paper illustrates why
   recognition of the collective enterprise of survivorship - and the
   collective production of emotion, more generally - is important in light
   of persistent, culturally dominant conceptions of the individual patient
   as the primary 'afflicted', 'feeling', and 'treated' subject. Building
   on previous work on affective relations and moral framings, we posit
   that the collective affects of survivorship inflect what people living
   with cancer can, and should, feel. We highlight how such things as hope,
   resignation, optimism, and dread are 'products' of the collective
   affects of cancer, with implications for how survivorship is lived,
   felt, and done.

AB The article examines the limitations of methodological nationalism in
   the studies of social memory through a case study of memory of Stalinist
   repression in Belarus. It analyses how various social agencies -
   national and local activists, religious organisations, and international
   foundations - use the memory of repression for constructing post-Soviet
   Belarusian identity by embedding their national representations in
   larger transnational frameworks. Drawing on the concept of 'internal
   globalisation', this article develops the idea of 'internal
   transnationalism' that suggests the importance of wider transnational
   configurations for the definition of nation. Internalized
   transnationalism does not make a national memory concept less
   nation-centred, but it affects the choice of its cultural, political and
   civilizational framing. In contrast to methodological cosmopolitanism
   that implies rediscovering of the national as an internalized global,
   methodological transnationalism emphasizes the multiplicity of
   co-existing transnational networks that can be invoked by social actors
   in their national mnemonic agenda. Using the case of the Kurapaty
   memorial site the article analyses how multiple framings of memory
   representations - the Belarusian national memory, liberal anti-communist
   memory, contesting memories, such as Polish, Baltic and Jewish - compete
   and juxtapose in the space of social memory of political repression.

AB In the seemingly routine and the everyday, lie layers of cultural and
   social symbolism. So it is with dirt. This article examines the social
   and cultural roles of dirt within socialization practices in
   working-class industrial and ex-industrial communities. Drawn from oral
   history accounts with 46 former and current engineering apprentices, the
   discussion demonstrates dirt as a concept and a practicality, and how
   the idea of 'getting dirty' provided a cultural imagery used to
   renegotiate moral boundaries that devalue working class, masculine
   experiences and identities. Building on from the work of Skeggs (1997,
   2004, 2011), it demonstrates the lived experience of value within the
   industrial workplace past and present. Through dirt, the role of
   cultural artefacts and iconography within working-class experience and
   workplace training is explored. Additionally, the role of a cultural
   icon like dirt in the intergenerational dialogues of workplace
   communities is given new attention. In doing so the article argues that
   while after decades of underinvestment in apprenticeships as a model for
   training in the UK, a recent resurgence in interest can go some way in
   overcoming the long-term effects of the loss of large-scale industrial
   work. However, the cultures of work attached to the apprenticeships of
   the past are, within deindustrialization, much more complicated to
   develop or recreate.

AB Most democracies are governed by coalitions, comprising multiple
   political parties with conflicting policy positions. The prevalence of
   these governments poses a significant question: Which parties' electoral
   commitments are ultimately reflected in government policy? Recent
   theories have challenged our understanding of multiparty government,
   arguing that the relative influence of coalition parties depends
   crucially on institutional context. Specifically, where institutions
   allow credible enforcement of bargains, policy should reflect a
   compromise among all governing parties; where such institutions are
   absent, the preferences of parties controlling the relevant ministries
   should prevail. Critically, empirical work has thus far failed to
   provide direct evidence for this conditional relationship. Analyzing
   changes in social protection policies in 15 parliamentary democracies,
   we provide the first systematic evidence that the strength of
   legislative institutions significantly shapes the relative policy
   influence of coalition parties. Our findings have implications for our
   understanding of coalition government, policymaking, and electoral
   responsiveness.

AB Why are some societies more unequal than others? The French
   revolutionaries believed unequal inheritances among siblings to be
   responsible for the strict hierarchies of the ancien regime. To achieve
   equality, the revolutionaries therefore enforced equal inheritance
   rights. Their goal was to empower women and to disenfranchise the noble
   class. But do equal inheritances succeed in leveling the societal
   playing field? We study Germany-a country with pronounced local-level
   variation in inheritance customs-and find that municipalities that
   historically equally apportioned wealth, to this day, elect more women
   into political councils and have fewer aristocrats in the social elite.
   Using historic data, we point to two mechanisms: wealth equality and
   pro-egalitarian preferences. In a final step, we also show that,
   counterintuitively, equitable inheritance customs positively predict
   income inequality. We interpret this finding to mean that equitable
   inheritances level the playing field by rewarding talent, not status.

AB Research on stratification and mobility has consistently shown that in
   the UK there is a direct impact of social origin on occupational
   destination net of educational attainment even for degree-holders.
   However, only a few studies applied a longitudinal and dynamic
   perspective on how intergenerational mobility shapes graduates' working
   careers. Using multilevel growth curve modelling and data from the 1970
   British cohort study (BCS70), we contribute to this research by looking
   at the emergence of social inequalities during the first ten years since
   labour market entry. We further distinguish between graduates of
   different fields of study as we expect social disparities to develop
   differently due to differences in initial occupational placement and
   upward mobility processes. We find that parental class does not affect
   occupational prestige over and above prior achievement. Separate
   analyses by the field of study show that initial differences in
   occupational prestige and career progression do not differ between
   graduates from different classes of origin in STEM fields, and arts and
   humanities. It is only in the social sciences that working-class
   graduates start with lower occupational prestige but soon catch up with
   their peers from higher classes. Overall, our results indicate no direct
   effect of social origin on occupational attainment for degree-holders
   once we broaden our focus to a dynamic life course perspective.

EA AUG 2019

AB Street harassment is recognized as an 'everyday' form of violence
   against women. Influenced by contemporary sociologies of everyday life,
   this article examines women responses to street harassment, drawing on
   over 500 first person narratives submitted to the website of Hollaback
   London. The narrative structure highlights women's actions, which (like
   street harassment) have generally been considered inconsequential.
   Quantitative content analysis reveals the extent and variety of
   strategies employed by women, including speaking back, calling on others
   for help, physically fighting back, walking away and an array of
   'small', everyday actions and gestures that aim to resist harassment. I
   argue that these responses comprise everyday self-defence practice.
   Furthermore, the notion of narrative habitus is employed to argue that
   Hollaback narratives do not just describe harassment, but that reading
   narratives can generate dispositions for self-defence. Narrative
   analysis reveals the way that satire is employed to make space for
   women's successful self-defence. I argue that Hollaback narratives do
   not just offer storylines or scripts for resisting street harassment but
   foster a style for doing so. Analysis considers the limits to
   narratively motivated self-defence. This research demonstrates that, in
   order to 'see' women's resistance, we need to pay close attention to the
   everyday as the site of both oppression and moments of liberation.

AB The sociology of homosexuality lacks engagement with queer theory and
   postcolonialism and focuses primarily on the global metropoles, thus
   failing to provide a plausible account of non-Western non-normative
   sexual identities. This research adopts the author's newly proposed
   transnational queer sociology to address these deficiencies. First, it
   critiques the Western model of sexual identity predominantly employed to
   elucidate non-Western, non-normative sexualities. It does so by
   examining not only the queer flows between West and non-West but also
   those among and within non-Western contexts to produce translocally
   shared and mutually referenced experiences. Second, the proposed
   approach combines sociology with queer theory by emphasizing the
   significant role of material, as well as discursive, analyses in shaping
   queer identities, desires and practices. This article employs the
   approach to examine young gay male identities, as revealed in 90
   in-depth interviews conducted in Hong Kong (n = 30), Taiwan (Taipei, n =
   30) and mainland China (Shanghai, n = 30) between 2017 and 2019. More
   specifically, it highlights the interplay between the state and identity
   by investigating the intersection and intertwining effects of these
   young men's sexual and cultural/national identities, revealing three
   different forms of civic-political activism. The article both
   demonstrates the way in which sexuality and the state are mutually
   constituted and provides nuanced analysis of the heterogeneity of
   contemporary homosexualities in Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. In
   applying a new sociological approach to understanding sexuality, this
   research joins the growing body of scholarship within sociology that is
   decentring the Western formation of universal knowledge.

AB How do women gain authority in the public sphere, especially in contexts
   where patriarchal norms are prevalent? I argue that the leaders of
   patriarchal social movements face pragmatic incentives to expand women's
   authority roles when seeking new movement members. Women authorities
   help patriarchal movements by making persuasive, identity-based
   arguments in favor of patriarchy that men cannot, and by reaching new
   audiences that men cannot. I support this argument by examining the rise
   of online female preachers in the Islamist Salafi movement, using
   interviews, Twitter analysis, and automated text analysis of 21,000
   texts by 172 men and 43 women on the Salafi-oriented website saaid.net.
   To show the theory's generality, I also apply it to the contemporary
   white nationalist movement in the United States. The findings illustrate
   how movements that aggressively enforce traditional gender roles for
   participants can nevertheless increase female authority for pragmatic
   political reasons.

AB In theory, candidate debates can influence voters by providing
   information about candidates' quality and policy positions. However,
   there is limited evidence about whether and why debates influence voters
   in new democracies. We use a field experiment on parliamentary debates
   during Ghana's 2016 elections to show that debates improve voters'
   evaluations of candidates. Debates have the strongest effect on partisan
   voters, who become more favorable toward and more likely to vote for
   opponent-party candidates and less likely to vote for co-partisans.
   Experimental and unique observational data capturing participants'
   second-by-second reactions to the debates show that policy information
   was the most important causal mechanism driving partisan moderation,
   especially among strong partisans. A follow-up survey shows that these
   effects persist in electorally competitive communities, whereas they
   dissipate in party strongholds. Policy-centered debates have the
   potential to reduce partisan polarization in new democracies, but the
   local political context conditions the persistence of these effects.

EA AUG 2019
PY 2019
AB The individualization, privatization and marketization of risk
   management represent a fundamental dimension of the financialization of
   everyday life. As individuals are required to engage with financial
   products and services as the main way of protecting themselves from
   risks and uncertainties, their economic welfare and security are
   construed as depending largely on their own financial decisions. Within
   this setting, the concept of financial literacy and accompanying
   practices of financial education have emerged as a prominent
   institutional field handling the formulation and communication of the
   attributes and dispositions that arguably constitute the proper
   financial actor. This article analyzes financial education programmes
   currently conducted by state agencies in Israel, examining the notions
   and principles they articulate when defining and explaining proper
   financial conduct. The study indicates that moral themes and categories
   occupy a salient place in the formulation of the character traits that
   constitute the desired literate financial actor. Notions of individual
   responsibility, planning ahead and rational risk management are
   presented not merely as instrumental resources, but as moral
   imperatives. Through these notions, the programmes moralize a broad
   array of everyday practices of personal finance such as saving,
   investing, borrowing and budget management, thereby connecting the
   sphere of financial matters to the domain of moral virtues. Offering a
   representation of particular modes of financial conduct as constitutive
   components of morally virtuous personhood, these practices imbue the
   financial field as a whole, especially its current generalized logic of
   individualized and marketized risk management, with moral meanings,
   hence contributing to the normalization and depoliticization of the
   financialization of everyday life.

AB We propose a model of educational decision-making based on rational

   make inference about the costs and benefits of different educational
   options. Our model is simple, extends ideas from previous models, and
   has testable implications. We test our model using data on Danish
   monozygotic twins and find that (i) students who receive a positive
   signal about their academic ability have a higher likelihood of
   enrolling in and completing a college-bound track compared with those
   who do not; (ii) the effect of the signal is stronger for students from
   low socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds than for those from high-SES
   ones; and (iii) for low-SES students the effect is stronger on enrolment
   than on completion. Our results suggest that signals about academic
   ability affect educational decisions in general; they are more important
   for students who do not have a family 'push' to avoid downward social
   mobility; and they affect educational inequality by making low-SES
   students too optimistic about their likelihood of completing the

   poorly understood. This article seeks to shed new light on this question
   by using a quasi-experimental approach to examine the difference in
   educational inequality between East and West Germany before and after
   German unification. We compare changes in the class gradient in the
   attainment of comparable school and university qualifications in East
   and West Germany across six birth cohorts, including three cohorts of
   individuals who completed their schooling after unification. We find
   that before unification, inequality of educational opportunity at the
   mid-secondary, upper-secondary and tertiary level was substantially
   lower in East Germany than in West Germany and that unification led to a
   substantial and sustained convergence of the level of inequality of
   educational opportunity in East Germany towards that of West Germany.

   students are disproportionally affected by mental health problems. I

AB We analyze the effects of formal recognition of foreign higher education
   on employment probabilities and earnings for newly arrived immigrants in
   Sweden. Prior research has found that immigrants have lower returns on
   education if it was acquired in the country of origin than if it was
   acquired in the host country. One reason for this is that foreign
   credentials work poorly as productivity signals and risk-averse
   employers avoid employees with credentials they do not fully understand.
   A formal recognition statement can help overcome this problem by
   providing credible information about the foreign education, thus
   reducing uncertainty. Data consists of immigrants who, within the first
   ten years of residence in Sweden, had their foreign degree formally
   recognized during 2007-2011. Using fixed effects regressions, we
   estimate the treatment effect of official recognition to be 4.4
   percentage points higher probability of being employed, and 13.9 log
   points higher wage for those with employment. We also find considerable
   treatment effect heterogeneity across subcategories of immigrants from
   different regions of origin, with different reasons for immigration and
   who obtained recognition during different economic conditions. Our
   conclusions are that the mechanism of employer uncertainty is real, and
   that recognition does reduce it. But as the signal of foreign education
   becomes better, other mechanisms such as human capital transferability
   problems and quality differences, and the ability to use foreign human
   capital, become more salient, leading to heterogeneous effects.

AB Despite the intuitive notion that educational homogamy matters for the
   distribution of economic resources across households, existing research
   finds that changes in educational homogamy have had little impact on
   inequality between households. In this article, we document whether this
   conclusion generalizes to 21 countries and aim to understand the reasons
   why. We use data from the Luxembourg Income Studies to simulate the
   impact of both observed and hypothetical changes in educational homogamy
   on inequality. If educational homogamy had remained stable over time,
   the estimated difference between observed and simulated inequality would
   have been below 1 per cent in most countries. Extreme hypothetical
   changes from maximum hypergamy and hypogamy to maximum educational
   homogamy were simulated to increase inequality between 7 and 41 per
   cent, depending on the country. Hence, even though changes in
   educational homogamy have the potential to affect inequality, actual
   changes observed in this study were not strong enough to have a major
   impact. Additional analysis revealed that the potential impact of
   educational homogamy was systematically lower in countries with high
   levels of female labor force participation. Future changes in
   educational homogamy might therefore have an even smaller impact on
   inequality as ever more countries attain high levels of female
   employment.

AB The spatial concentration of immigrants in disadvantaged neighbourhoods
   may hinder their opportunities for social and economic integration. It
   is therefore important that immigrants can translate their available
   economic resources into mobility to less disadvantaged neighbourhoods.
   This study adds to existing research on the relationship between
   socioeconomic and spatial integration by focusing on the effects of
   income mobility on residential mobility. We analyse intra-urban
   residential mobility from low-income neighbourhoods into non-low-income
   neighbourhoods among immigrants and native-born residents in three urban
   regions in Finland. We use longitudinal register data for the 2004-2014
   period for the full population, allowing a dynamic analysis of changes
   in income and neighbourhood of residence. Based on fixed-effects
   multinomial logit modelling of residential outcomes, we found that
   upward income mobility is connected to exit from low-income areas, but
   the effect is stronger among the native-born Finns than among those with
   an immigrant background. This stronger effect for natives is in contrast
   to findings of previous European studies, suggesting that these might
   have been influenced by unobserved individual-level heterogeneity. Our
   findings imply that both policies improving labour market opportunities
   of immigrants and policies reducing constraints for spatial integration
   are needed if the aim is to decrease ethnic residential segregation.

AB Existing empirical research on the link between ethnic minority
   concentration in residential environments and voting for the radical
   right is inconclusive, mainly due to major differences between studies
   in the spatial scale at which minority concentration is measured. We
   examined whether the presence of non-western ethnic minorities in the
   residential environment, measured at four spatial scales, is related to
   individuals' intention to vote for the Dutch Party for Freedom (Dutch
   acronym PVV). We combined individual level survey data and register
   data, and we used multi-level structural equation models to examine
   possible mediation by anti-immigrant attitudes and political
   dissatisfaction. The models show different effects at different scales.
   At the micro scale (100 by 100 meter grids) we find a curvilinear
   effect: individuals with 30-50 per cent non-western minorities in their
   direct living environment are most likely to report to vote for the PVV.
   At higher spatial scales (up to municipal level) we find that the higher
   the proportion of non-western minorities, the more likely individuals
   are to report to vote for the PVV. These effects can however not be
   explained by anti-immigrant attitudes or political dissatisfaction. We
   even find that at the micro scale the presence of non-western minorities
   is related to less anti-immigrant attitudes.

AB Interethnic friendships are highly beneficial for decreasing ethnic
   prejudice. However, this is not true when friends identifying with
   different ethnic groups perceive each other as of the same ethnicity. We
   investigate the extent to which people categorize their friends
   "incorrectly", that is, not matching these friends'
   self-identifications. We thus move beyond the established practice of
   conceptualizing ethnic categorization as an individual characteristic
   ("who is categorized into which ethnicity"), and define it on the level
   of pairwise relations (who categorizes whom into which ethnicity), which
   enables us to model the effect of friendship on ethnic categorization.
   Using dynamic social network models, we also disentangle this effect
   from the simultaneous effect of categorization on friendship, taking
   characteristics (e.g. self-identifications) of both the observed and the
   observing individual into account. On data of 12 Hungarian high-school
   classes with one minority group, the Roma, we find that students of the
   majority group tend to select and keep friends whom they observe as
   majority members. In contrast, students of the minority group do not
   prefer other minority members when choosing friends, but tend to
   categorize their existing friends as minority peers. We conclude that
   these are two different manifestations of the preference for same-ethnic
   friends.

AB Recent waves of immigration have changed the demographic face of
   European societies and fueled considerable debate over the consequences
   of ethnic diversity for social cohesion. One prominent argument in this
   debate holds that individuals are less willing to extend trust and
   solidarity across ethnic lines, leading to lower social capital in
   multiethnic communities. We present a direct test of this proposition in
   a field experiment involving native-immigrant interactions in Zurich's
   Central Train Station. Our intervention consists of approaching
   commuters with a small request for assistance (borrowing a mobile
   phone), which we take as a measure of prosociality. We further
   differentiate between reactions towards natives as well as both high-
   and low-status immigrant groups. Compared to native-native interactions,
   we find lower solidarity in native-immigrant encounters, especially in
   cases involving stereotypically low-status immigrants. In exploratory
   analyses, we further show that discrimination only obtains in 'low cost'
   situations where commuters could easily justify not helping (e.g. by
   claiming not to carry a phone). Overall our results shed light on key
   theoretical mechanisms underlying patterns of solidarity in contemporary
   multiethnic societies.

AB A common objection to "sin taxes"-corrective taxes on goods that are
   thought to be overconsumed, such as cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary
   drinks-is that they often fall disproportionately on low-income
   consumers. This paper studies the interaction between corrective and
   redistributive motives in a general optimal taxation framework and
   delivers empirically implementable formulas for sufficient statistics
   for the optimal commodity tax. The optimal sin tax is increasing in the
   price elasticity of demand, increasing in the degree to which
   lower-income consumers are more biased or more elastic to the tax,
   decreasing in the extent to which consumption is concentrated among the
   poor, and decreasing in income effects, because income effects imply
   that commodity taxes create labor supply distortions. Contrary to common
   intuitions, stronger preferences for redistribution can increase the
   optimal sin tax, if lower-income consumers are more responsive to taxes
   or are more biased. As an application, we estimate the optimal
   nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, using Nielsen Homescan data
   and a specially designed survey measuring nutrition knowledge and
   self-control. Holding federal income tax rates constant, our estimates
   imply an optimal federal sugar-sweetened beverage tax of 1 to 2.1 cents
   per ounce, although optimal city-level taxes could be as much as 60%
   lower due to cross-border shopping.

AB This article develops and empirically tests a model of political

   nonvoting forms of political engagement. Using one of the first
   nationwide surveys of undocumented millennials between the ages of 18
   and 35 ( n 1/4 1,472), we show that (1) undocumented youth express much
   higher levels of political efficacy and participation than the
   literature on immigrant political incorporation leads us to expect, (2)
   membership in organizations that work on immigration-related issues is a
   main determinant of this sense of political efficacy, and (3) through
   mediation analysis, that organizational membership (the mediator)
   influences how political efficacy affects political participation, and
   not the other way around. The literature on immigrant political
   incorporation is vast, but precedent studies too often focus on formal
   acts of political participation, such as naturalization and voting, by
   those with lawful immigration status. With an analytical focus on youth
   without lawful immigration status, this article contributes to
   theoretical and empirical knowledge about how and to what extent
   undocumented youth become politically active and engaged despite the
   many obstacles that exist to their formal participation in politics.

AB Recent research shows that the foreign born utilize both local and
   long-distance social relationships to become entrepreneurs, affecting
   immigrants' chances at upward mobility and their contributions to
   economic development. Scholars have yet to assess how African American
   entrepreneurs take part in similar types of geographically dispersed
   business communities. Using multi-level social network analyses and OLS
   regressions to compare the geography of buyer-supplier ties originating
   from one immigrant neighborhood and one African American neighborhood in
   Chicago, this article highlights a unique mechanism that places African
   Americans at a disadvantage compared to immigrants: a lack of geographic
   diversity in African American social capital. Immigrant entrepreneurs'
   social networks, unlike African Americans' networks, connect the foreign
   born to more people in different places, enabling them to circumvent the
   limitations of their local communities and accrue more business assets.
   Contrary to existing research, many foreign-born business owners in this
   study relied on intra-national rather than local or transnational social
   ties. These findings challenge researchers to reevaluate the geographic
   foundations of immigrant and African American entrepreneurship and
   reexamine how ethnic minority entrepreneurship affects patterns of
   social stratification and economic development.

AB Groundwater from the Ogallala-High Plains Aquifer supports one of the
   most productive agriculture regions in the world. Yet, despite nearly 40
   years of policies designed to conserve and sustain this vital resource,
   the Aquifer continues to be depleted at an unsustainable rate. We
   integrate propositions from treadmill of production theory and
   ecological modernization theory to develop a structural model, focusing
   especially on the role of technological modernization as a key mechanism
   motivating depletion. A time-sequenced path analysis of all counties in
   the Ogallala Aquifer region reveals that groundwater depletion has a
   strong internal momentum characteristic of an agricultural production
   treadmill. Technological modernization promotes depletion through
   Jevon's Paradox. Increases in water efficiency-more crop per drop-are
   associated with less groundwater consumption, but more extensive
   deployments of irrigation infrastructures overwhelm the beneficial
   effects of increased water efficiency. An income-subsidy mechanism
   supports the treadmill dynamic. Agricultural production and increased
   water efficiency do not influence incomes. Instead, incomes are
   influenced mainly by expansions of irrigation technologies, which
   generates subsidies, and this dynamic puts further "spin" on the
   treadmill. The implications of the findings for theory and policy are
   discussed.

AB Existing literature has demonstrated that victims of domestic violence
   and rape undergo processes of discipline when they interact with legal
   structures, transforming themselves into "worthy victims." Intervening
   in this literature, I show how the medicalization of institutions
   surrounding domestic violence creates conditions under which women must
   prove their survivorhood, performing psychological recovery to achieve
   institutional legibility. Legal and therapeutic institutions create a
   matrix of demands on women's lives, shaping their practices of survival
   and performances of self. Through interviews with domestic violence
   survivors, I show that women engage three strategies of transformation
   to make themselves credible survivors: (1) extracting domestic violence
   from their life stories; (2) explaining abuse through "self-esteem;" (3)
   performing survivorhood through "respectable" motherhood and sexuality.
   Through these processes, women craft a domestic violence narrative and
   an institutional performance of survivorhood, both of which allow them
   to navigate institutional pressures. These therapeutic narratives and
   performances, however, also rewrite the structural elements of violence
   into (feminized) accounts of psychological failure and overcoming. Thus,
   women navigate a paradox when they become survivors: they must tell
   stories of psychological recovery, even as those stories obfuscate the
   very infrastructure of violence. It is this disjuncture between
   individualized narratives of harm and the structural work of survival
   that I examine in this work. I develop the concept of the "paradox of
   legibility" to generalize this disjuncture, and to highlight women's
   labor of making themselves credible amidst structural and institutional
   constraints.

AB Research on neighborhood structural conditions like concentrated
   disadvantage and crime largely focuses on between-neighborhood
   differences; for example, places with more disadvantage are expected to
   experience higher homicide rates. However, empirical research often does
   not consider within-neighborhood dynamics of structural stability and
   change. Furthermore, several recent studies have found cross-sectional
   associations between structural variables and crime outcomes can vary
   significantly across units, violating a key assumption of global
   modeling strategies. The current work explores if and how historical
   changes in disadvantage influence neighborhood collective efficacy and
   homicide rates, net of the level of disadvantage at a given time point.
   Collective efficacy theoretically mediates the relationship between
   conditions and crime, and is hypothesized to be the mechanism through
   which structural change influences homicide rates. It is also
   hypothesized that spatial variation in cross-sectional associations
   between disadvantage and social outcomes can be explained by accounting
   for within-neighborhood changes in disadvantage. Using a sample of
   Chicago neighborhoods and ordinary least squares and geographically
   weighted regression models, I find that within-neighborhood changes in
   disadvantage significantly predict neighborhood collective efficacy,
   though the effects of this change on homicide rates are not completely
   mediated by collective efficacy. Within-neighborhood change completely
   accounts for spatial variation in cross- sectional associations,
   offering one explanation of prior research findings. Within-neighborhood
   structural changes appear to disrupt collective efficacy and contribute
   to higher homicide rates than predicted by the level of disadvantage
   alone.

   expected to increase substantially in coming years. Instead of targeting
   a specific large-scale disaster and assessing how different
   sub-populations recover, we begin with a nationally representative
   sample of respondents from the restricted, geocoded Panel Study of
   Income Dynamics. We follow them through time (1999-2013) as hazard
   damages of varying scales accrue in the counties where they live. This
   design synthesizes the longitudinal, population-centered approach common
   in stratification research with a broad hazard-centered focus that
   extends beyond disasters to integrate ongoing environmental dynamics
   more centrally into the production of social inequality. Results
   indicate that as local hazard damages increase, so does wealth
   inequality, especially along lines of race, education, and
   homeownership. At any given level of local damage, the more aid an area
   receives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the more this
   inequality grows. These findings suggest that two defining social
   problems of our day - wealth inequality and rising natural hazard
   damages - are dynamically linked, requiring new lines of research and
   policy making in the future.

   Impacts on related personality traits are consistent with this result.

AB We develop an asset pricing model with flexible heterogeneity in asset

   holdings. A portfolio choice model implies characteristics-based demand
   when returns have a factor structure and expected returns and factor
   loadings depend on the assets' own characteristics. We propose an
   instrumental variables estimator for the characteristics-based demand
   system to address the endogeneity of demand and asset prices. Using US
   stock market data, we illustrate how the model could be used to
   understand the role of institutions in asset market movements,

   frictions reduce consumer surplus by $12/month/consumer, 28 percent of
   which can be associated with discrimination, 22 percent with inefficient

   We apply it to document cheap-talk signaling in the use of round-number

   offers that are 8-12 percent lower but are 15-25 percent more likely to

   Those same sellers are more likely to accept a similar offer, and buyers

AB While there is strong evidence that more productive plants select into
   exporting, the literature has struggled to identify export-related
   efficiency gains within plants. We show that this is due to the common
   use of revenue-based productivity measures (TFPR): more efficient
   producers tend to charge lower prices, leading to a downward bias in
   TFPR. Using census panels of Chilean, Colombian, and Mexican
   manufacturing plants, we find sizable efficiency gains after export
   entry based on efficiency measures that are not affected by output
   prices. Evidence suggests that a complementarity between exporting and
   investment in technology is an important driver of these gains.

AB Opioid use claims many thousands of lives each year. This article
   considers the diffusion of prescription opioid (PO) use within family
   households as one potential culprit of the proliferation of these
   medications. In an analysis of hundreds of millions of medical claims
   and almost 14 million opioid prescriptions in one state between 2010 and
   2015, we show that the use of POs spreads within family households. We
   also show that the treatment effect of exposure to a family member's PO
   use is driven by an increase in PO consumption for medical conditions
   that members of treated and untreated families experience at nearly
   identical rates. This pattern of results suggests household exposure
   causes an uptick in patient demand for prescription opioids. We use an
   instrumental variable estimation strategy to address the well-known
   challenges to estimating a causal effect of intra-household contagion,
   such as genotypic similarities among family members, assortative
   matching in partner selection, and clustering of health conditions
   within households. The results spotlight the salience of the most
   ubiquitous social structure, the family household, in accelerating
   opioid consumption to unprecedented levels. The findings also suggest
   that rather than direct social influence between physicians, the spread
   of prescription behavior in physician networks may be driven by shifts
   in patient demand that propagate through the patient sharing network.

AB How do public safety net and elite private mental health providers cope
   with a key dilemma since psychiatric deinstitutionalization-managing
   madness when people have the right to refuse care? I observed two
   approaches to voluntary community-based services, one that tolerates
   "non-compliance" and deviant choices, and another that attempts to
   therapeutically discipline clientele. The puzzle, given theories of the
   paternalistic governance of poverty, is that select poor patients are
   given autonomy while the privileged are micro-managed. Drawing on
   comparative fieldwork in Los Angeles, I show how contrasting ecological
   pressures and resource bases shape divergent practices. In the context
   of urban poverty governance, mental health care and low-barrier housing
   offer a way to remove problem people from public space. This "tolerant
   containment" is linked to limited therapeutic capacity and the
   construction of clients as beyond transformation. In the context of
   family systems governance, elite private mental health care is a project
   to reform wayward relatives and equip them with respectable futures. A
   "concerted constraint" of deviance, akin to Lareau's theory of
   privileged childrearing, is reserved for those who can afford
   rehabilitation and conceivably recover. Using these cases, I contribute
   to theories of social control and inequality in advanced liberal
   societies.

AB It is widely believed that democracy requires public support to survive.
   The empirical evidence for this hypothesis is weak, however, with
   existing tests resting on small cross-sectional samples and producing
   contradictory results. The underlying problem is that survey measures of
   support for democracy are fragmented across time, space, and different
   survey questions. In response, this article uses a Bayesian latent
   variable model to estimate a smooth country-year panel of democratic
   support for 135 countries and up to 29 years. The article then
   demonstrates a positive effect of support on subsequent democratic
   change, while adjusting for the possible confounding effects of prior
   levels of democracy and unobservable time-invariant factors. Support is,
   moreover, more robustly linked with the endurance of democracy than its
   emergence in the first place. As Lipset (1959) and Easton (1965)
   hypothesized over 50 years ago, public support does indeed help
   democracy survive.

AB Research shows that peacekeepers reduce conflict intensity; however,
   effects of deployment on nonpolitical violence are unknown. This article
   focuses on criminal violence and proposes a twofold mechanism to explain
   why peacekeeping missions, even when effectively reducing conflict, can
   inadvertently increase criminal violence. First, less conflict opens up
   economic opportunities (so-called peacekeeping economies) and provides
   operational security for organized crime, thus increasing violent
   competition among criminal groups. Second, demobilized combatants are
   vulnerable to turn to crime because of limited legal livelihood
   opportunities and their training in warfare. While UN troops may
   exacerbate these dynamics, UN police's peculiar role is likely to
   successfully contain criminal violence. Cross-national and subnational
   empirical analyses show that large UN military deployments result in
   higher homicide rates, whereas UN police, overall, moderate this
   collateral effect.

AB There are two principal theoretical schools that seek to explain status
   outcomes in early adulthood: those focusing on intergenerational
   transmission of class privilege and those emphasizing individual
   characteristics, particularly ambition. The first may be called the
   structuralist school and the second the psycho-social school, following
   the Wisconsin Model of Status Attainment. A second structuralist
   perspective, Segmented Assimilation, highlights transmission of
   socio-economic status across immigrant generations, but emphasizes the
   positive role of co-ethnic resources for upward mobility and preventing
   downward assimilation. We examine these alternative predictions using a
   large longitudinal sample of youths in Spain that includes both children
   of native parentage and children of immigrants. Spain possesses
   characteristics that make it uniquely suitable to examine these
   predictions. Results show that both family socio-economic status and
   ambition, measured by adolescent educational aspirations and
   expectations, play important roles in educational and occupational
   attainment, but the influence of family status persists even after
   controlling for ambition. The influence of co-ethnic nationalities
   disappears after these controls, except among Chinese and Filipino
   youths, a result consistent with segmented assimilation. Predictive
   models of status attainment yield identical results for children of
   immigrants and children of natives, indicating that in Spain, they have
   become part of a common youth universe. Theoretical and practical
   implications of the analysis are discussed.

AB There has been a long-lasting debate over whether increasing ethnic
   diversity undermines support for social welfare, and whether this
   conflict thesis applies not only to the United States, but also to
   European welfare states. In their 2016 ASR article, Schmidt-Catran and
   Spies analyzed a panel (1994 to 2010) of regional units in Germany and
   concluded that this thesis also holds for Germany. We argue that their
   analysis suffers from misspecification: their model specification
   assumes parallel time trends in welfare support in all German regions.
   However, time trends strongly differed between Western and Eastern
   Germany after reunification. In the 1990s, Eastern Germans' attitudes
   adapted to a less interventionist Western welfare system ("Goodbye Lenin
   effect"). When allowing for heterogeneous time trends, we find no
   evidence that increasing proportions of foreigners undermine welfare
   support, or that this association is moderated by economic hardship
   (high unemployment rates). We conclude with some general suggestions
   regarding the conceptualization of context effects in spatial analyses.

   decades (1970 to 2010) to examine the criminogenic consequences of
   segregation for whites and blacks. Three notable findings emerge from
   our inquiry: (1) racial segregation substantially increases the risk of
   homicide victimization for blacks while (2) simultaneously decreasing
   the risk of white homicide victimization. The result of these
   heterogeneous effects is that (3) segregation plays a central role in
   driving black-white differences in homicide mortality. These findings
   suggest the declines in racial segregation since 1970 have substantially
   attenuated the black-white homicide gap.

AB What rhetorics run throughout radical discourse, and why do some gain
   prominence over others? The scholarship on radicalism largely portrays
   radical discourse as opposition to powerful ideas and enemies, but
   radicals often evince great interest in personal and local concerns. To
   shed light on how radicals use and adopt rhetoric, we analyze an
   original corpus of more than 23,000 pages produced by Afghan radical
   groups between 1979 and 2001 using a novel computational abductive
   approach. We first identify how radicalism not only attacks dominant
   ideas, actors, and institutions using a rhetoric of subversion, but also
   how it can use a rhetoric of reversion to urge intimate transformations
   in morals and behavior. Next, we find evidence that radicals' networks
   of support affect the rhetorical mixture they espouse, due to social
   ties drawing radicals into encounters with backers' social domains. Our
   study advances a relational understanding of radical discourse, while
   also showing how a combination of computational and abductive methods
   can help theorize and analyze discourses of contention.

AB Household labor is commonly defined as a set of physical tasks such as
   cooking, cleaning, and shopping. Sociologists sometimes reference
   non-physical activities related to "household management," but these are
   typically mentioned in passing, imprecisely defined, or treated as
   equivalent to physical tasks. Using 70 in-depth interviews with members
   of 35 couples, this study argues that such tasks are better understood
   as examples of a unique dimension of housework: cognitive labor. The
   data demonstrate that cognitive labor entails anticipating needs,
   identifying options for filling them, making decisions, and monitoring
   progress. Because such work is taxing but often invisible to both
   cognitive laborers and their partners, it is a frequent source of
   conflict for couples. Cognitive labor is also a gendered phenomenon:
   women in this study do more cognitive labor overall and more of the
   anticipation and monitoring work in particular. However, male and female
   participation in decision-making, arguably the cognitive labor component
   most closely linked to power and influence, is roughly equal. These
   findings identify and define an overlooked-yet potentially
   consequential-source of gender inequality at the household level and
   suggest a new direction for research on the division of household labor.

AB Research disrupts the social world, often by making respondents aware
   that they are being observed or by instigating reflection upon
   particular aspects of life via the very act of asking questions.
   Building on insights from the first Hawthorne studies, reflexive
   ethnographers, and methodologists concerned with panel conditioning, we
   draw on six years of research within a community in southern Malawi to
   introduce a conceptual framework for theorizing disruption in
   observational research. We present a series of poignant-yet-typical
   tales from the field and two additional tools-the
   refresher-sample-as-comparison and study-focused ethnography-for
   measuring disruption empirically in a longitudinal study. We find
   evidence of study effects in many domains of life that relate directly
   to our scope of inquiry (i.e., union formation, fertility) and in some
   that extend beyond it (i.e., health). Moreover, some study effects were
   already known and discussed in the broader community, which was also
   affected by our research in unintended ways. We conclude that the
   assumption of non-interactivity in observational research is shaky at
   best, urging data-gatherers and users to think more seriously about the
   role of disruption in their work.

AB Political life in many Muslim-majority countries has been marked by the
   electoral dominance of Islamist parties. Recent attempts to explain why
   have highlighted their material and organizational factors, such as the
   provision of social services. In this article, we revive an older
   literature that emphasizes the appeal of these parties' religious nature
   to voters experiencing economic hardship. Individuals suffering economic
   strain may vote for Islamists because they believe this to be an
   intrinsically virtuous act that will be met with divine rewards in the
   afterlife. We explore this hypothesis through a series of laboratory
   experiments in Tunisia. Individuals assigned to treatment conditions
   instilling feelings of economic strain exhibit greater support for
   Islamist parties, and this support is causally mediated by an
   expectation of divine compensation in the hereafter. The evidence
   suggests that the religious nature of Islamist parties may thus be an
   important factor in their electoral success.

AB This paper investigates how the 2008-9 recession affected civic
   participation in disadvantaged and affluent neighbourhoods in the city
   of Rotterdam. We hypothesize that levels of civic participation may
   either diverge or converge across neighbourhoods with a different
   socioeconomic status. We build upon a recent wave of studies examining
   how civil society has been affected by the 2008-9 recession. Using five
   waves from the Rotterdam Neighbourhood Profile survey (N = 63,134; 71
   neighbourhoods), we find converging trends in civic participation.
   Between 2008 and 2013, civic participation declined in affluent
   neighbourhoods but increased slightly in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.
   This convergence is partly due to the level of perceived problems in the
   neighbourhood and differences in the types of volunteering found in
   disadvantaged and affluent neighbourhoods. In addition, we argue that
   these converging trends can be better understood by considering the
   neighbourhood organizational infrastructure and local policy
   configurations. Next to examining the impact of the 2008-9 recession on
   civic participation, we contribute to research on civil society by
   comparing the UK and Dutch context.

   common factors, under the null, involves a parameter at the boundary
   (related to unit canonical correlations), we derive a parameter-free
   asymptotic Gaussian distribution. We show how the group factor setting
   applies to mixed-frequency data. As an empirical illustration, we
   address the question whether Industrial Production (IP) is still the
   dominant factor driving the U.S. economy using a mixed-frequency data
   panel of IP and non-IP sectors. We find that a single common factor
   explains 89% of IP output growth and 61% of total GDP growth despite the

AB We propose a bootstrap-based calibrated projection procedure to build
   confidence intervals for single components and for smooth functions of a
   partially identified parameter vector in moment (in)equality models. The
   method controls asymptotic coverage uniformly over a large class of data
   generating processes. The extreme points of the calibrated projection
   confidence interval are obtained by extremizing the value of the
   function of interest subject to a proper relaxation of studentized
   sample analogs of the moment (in)equality conditions. The degree of
   relaxation, or critical level, is calibrated so that the function of
   theta, not theta itself, is uniformly asymptotically covered with
   prespecified probability. This calibration is based on repeatedly
   checking feasibility of linear programming problems, rendering it
   computationally attractive. Nonetheless, the program defining an extreme
   point of the confidence interval is generally nonlinear and potentially
   intricate. We provide an algorithm, based on the response surface method
   for global optimization, that approximates the solution rapidly and
   accurately, and we establish its rate of convergence. The algorithm is
   of independent interest for optimization problems with simple objectives
   and complicated constraints. An empirical application estimating an
   entry game illustrates the usefulness of the method. Monte Carlo
   simulations confirm the accuracy of the solution algorithm, the good
   statistical as well as computational performance of calibrated
   projection (including in comparison to other methods), and the
   algorithm's potential to greatly accelerate computation of other
   confidence intervals.

AB We provide a nonlinear characterization of the macroeconomic impact of
   microeconomic productivity shocks in terms of reduced-form nonparametric
   elasticities for efficient economies. We also show how microeconomic
   parameters are mapped to these reduced-form general equilibrium
   elasticities. In this sense, we extend the foundational theorem of
   Hulten (1978) beyond the first order to capture nonlinearities. Key
   features ignored by first-order approximations that play a crucial role
   are: structural microeconomic elasticities of substitution, network
   linkages, structural microeconomic returns to scale, and the extent of
   factor reallocation. In a business-cycle calibration with sectoral
   shocks, nonlinearities magnify negative shocks and attenuate positive
   shocks, resulting in an aggregate output distribution that is asymmetric
   (negative skewness), fat-tailed (excess kurtosis), and has a negative
   mean, even when shocks are symmetric and thin-tailed. Average output
   losses due to short-run sectoral shocks are an order of magnitude larger
   than the welfare cost of business cycles calculated by Lucas (1987).
   Nonlinearities can also cause shocks to critical sectors to have
   disproportionate macroeconomic effects, almost tripling the estimated
   impact of the 1970s oil shocks on world aggregate output. Finally, in a
   long-run growth context, nonlinearities, which underpin Baumol's cost
   disease via the increase over time in the sales shares of low-growth
   bottleneck sectors, account for a 20 percentage point reduction in
   aggregate TFP growth over the period 1948-2014 in the United States.

   estimate of about 0.03 for an urban area with 100,000 inhabitants to
   0.08 for an urban area of the size of Paris. Our approach also yields a

AB This article models a frictional labour market where employers
   endogenously discriminate against the long-term unemployed. The
   estimated model replicates recent experimental evidence which documents
   that interview invitations for observationally equivalent workers fall
   sharply as unemployment duration progresses. We use the model to
   quantitatively assess the consequences of such employer behaviour for
   job finding rates and long-term unemployment and find only modest
   effects given the large decline in callbacks. Interviews lost to
   duration impact individual job finding rates solely if they would have
   led to jobs. We show that such instances are rare when firms
   discriminate in anticipation of an ultimately unsuccessful application.
   Discrimination in callbacks is thus largely a response to dynamic
   selection, with limited consequences for structural duration dependence
   and long-term unemployment.
