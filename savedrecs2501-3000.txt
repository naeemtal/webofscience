AB The rhetoric of both the Brexit and Trump campaigns was grounded in
   conceptions of the past as the basis for political claims in the
   present. Both established the past as constituted by nations that were
   represented as white' into which racialized others had insinuated
   themselves and gained disproportionate advantage. Hence, the resonant
   claim that was broadcast primarily to white audiences in each place to
   take our country back'. The politics of both campaigns was also echoed
   in those social scientific analyses that sought to focus on the
   legitimate' claims of the left behind' or those who had come to see
   themselves as strangers in their own land'. The skewing of white
   majority political action as the action of a more narrowly defined white
   working class served to legitimize analyses that might otherwise have
   been regarded as racist. In effect, I argue that a pervasive
   methodological whiteness' has distorted social scientific accounts of
   both Brexit and Trump's election victory and that this needs to be taken
   account of in our discussion of both phenomena.

AB Despite much positive change in the post civil rights era, U.S. notions
   of racism and white supremacy remain powerful elements of American
   culture. The adaptability and enduring power of these forces can be seen
   in the emergence of a new historical epoch best describe as the era of
   Laissez Faire Racism. Prevalent attitudes among white Americans, certain
   theoretical arguments and hypotheses in American sociology, as well the
   election of Donald Trump rest upon the on-going operation of racism. In
   particular, I attribute Trump's electoral success to three critical
   dilemmas of race that defined contours of the 2016 presidential
   election: (1) worsening economic inequality in the presence of rapidly
   changing ethno-racial demography; (2) intensified political partisanship
   in the presence of well-institutionalized racially coded campaign
   strategies and rhetoric; and (3) the failure of the Clinton campaign to
   simultaneously champion the interests of working and middle class
   families and galvanize the previously powerful multiracial Obama
   coalition. I speculate on how to forge more effective multiracial
   coalitions in the future.

AB Scholarly and journalistic accounts of the recent successes of
   radical-right politics in Europe and the United States, including the
   Brexit referendum and the Trump campaign, tend to conflate three
   phenomena: populism, ethno-nationalism and authoritarianism. While all
   three are important elements of the radical right, they are neither
   coterminous nor limited to the right. The resulting lack of analytical
   clarity has hindered accounts of the causes and consequences of
   ethno-nationalist populism. To address this problem, I bring together
   existing research on nationalism, populism and authoritarianism in
   contemporary democracies to precisely define these concepts and examine
   temporal patterns in their supply and demand, that is, politicians'
   discursive strategies and the corresponding public attitudes. Based on
   the available evidence, I conclude that both the supply and demand sides
   of radical politics have been relatively stable over time, which
   suggests that in order to understand public support for radical
   politics, scholars should instead focus on the increased resonance
   between pre-existing attitudes and discursive frames. Drawing on recent
   research in cultural sociology, I argue that resonance is not only a
   function of the congruence between a frame and the beliefs of its
   audience, but also of shifting context. In the case of radical-right
   politics, a variety of social changes have engendered a sense of
   collective status threat among national ethnocultural majorities.
   Political and media discourse has channelled such threats into
   resentments toward elites, immigrants, and ethnic, racial and religious
   minorities, thereby activating previously latent attitudes and lending
   legitimacy to radical political campaigns that promise to return power
   and status to their aggrieved supporters. Not only does this form of
   politics threaten democratic institutions and inter-group relations, but
   it also has the potential to alter the contours of mainstream public
   discourse, thereby creating the conditions of possibility for future
   successes of populist, nationalist, and authoritarian politics.

AB This paper considers the contemporary significance of white racism and
   its association with nationalist sentiment amongst a cohort late middle
   aged white Britons, using survey responses and qualitative interviews
   from the 1958 National Child Development Study. We have shown that
   although overt racism is very limited, a substantial minority of white
   Britons display ambivalent feelings which have the potential to be
   mobilised in racist directions. We argue against the view that
   disadvantaged white working class respondents are especially xenophobic,
   and show that racist views are not strongly associated with social
   position. In exploring the clustering of different nationalist and
   racist sentiments amongst economic and cultural elites, and comparing
   these with disenfranchised' respondents with little economic and
   cultural capital, we show that it is actually the elite who are most
   likely to articulate imperial racism'. By contrast, the disenfranchised'
   articulate a kind of anti-establishment nationalism which is not
   strongly racist. We also show that the elite are strongly internally
   divided, with a substantial number of the cultural elite being strongly
   anti-racist and committed to multi-culturalism, so generating strong
   internal factionalism between elite positions. Our paper therefore
   underscores how intensifying inequalities have facilitated the
   volatility and variability of nationalist and racist sentiment.

AB This paper explores the factors that have recently increased support for
   candidates and causes of the populist right across the developed
   democracies, especially among a core group of working-class men. In the
   context of debates about whether the key causal factors are economic or
   cultural, we contend that an effective analysis must rest on
   understanding how economic and cultural developments interact to
   generate support for populism. We suggest that one way to do so is to
   see status anxiety as a proximate factor inducing support for populism,
   and economic and cultural developments as factors that combine to
   precipitate such anxiety. Using cross-national survey data from 20
   developed democracies, we assess the viability of this approach. We show
   that lower levels of subjective social status are associated with
   support for right populist parties, identify a set of economic and
   cultural developments likely to have depressed the social status of men
   without a college education, and show that the relative social status of
   those men has declined since 1987 in many of the developed democracies.
   We conclude that status effects provide one pathway through which
   economic and cultural developments may combine to increase support for
   the populist right.

AB We address resurgent populism by examining structural processes of state
   transformation in the UK, the US and France. Scholars stress the
   unifying energy of the state', a set of institutions and policies
   capable of limiting inequalities and defending legal regimes. One
   characteristic of modern Western statehood were packages of policies
   designed to integrate social groups and territories in part by ensuring
   common standards of provision and social citizenship across the nation
   state. This echoes James Scott's critical analysis of the modernist
   project of the state (1998). This unifying energy' had different origins
   including nationalist movements, combatting external influence or
   powers, war, and preparing citizens for the rigours of
   industrialization. Overcoming class differences and territorial
   differences (including cultural, social and economic differences) was a
   major source of mobilization to feed this unifying energy of the state'
   in France, Italy or Spain for instance. Political and cultural
   identities are related in significant part to respective nation states.
   We argue that this unifying energy' was an essential component of
   statehood in Europe and in the US. It is now largely lost. We explain
   why and the significance of its displacement.

AB This paper contributes to the study of social change by considering
   boundary work as a dimension of cultural change. Drawing on the
   computer-assisted qualitative analysis of 73 formal speeches made by
   Donald Trump during the 2016 electoral campaign, we argue that his
   political rhetoric, which led to his presidential victory, addressed the
   white working class's concern with their declining position in the
   national pecking order. He addressed this group's concern by raising
   their moral status, that is, by (1) emphatically describing them as
   hard-working Americans who are victims of globalization; (2) voicing
   their concerns about people above' (professionals, the rich, and
   politicians); (3) drawing strong moral boundaries toward undocumented
   immigrants, refugees, and Muslims; (4) presenting African Americans and
   (legal) Hispanic Americans as workers who also deserve jobs; (5)
   stressing the role of working-class men as protectors of women and LGBTQ
   people. This particular case study of the role of boundary work in
   political rhetoric provides a novel, distinctively sociological approach
   for capturing dynamics of social change.

AB Many Democrats hoped that a particular kind of identity politics -
   women's - would help Hillary Clinton win the White House. In the
   aftermath of the election, some commentators bemoaned the fact that a
   majority of white women had voted for Trump, and called it a kind of
   betrayal, underlining their expectation that women would naturally, on
   the basis of their gender identity, support a woman with women-friendly
   politics. Indeed, this kind of thinking about identity politics has been
   widespread with reference to a number of demographic groups. Meanwhile,
   identity politics is lamented from the right and left by those who
   favour a greater emphasis on class-based inequalities, or a greater
   national identity, some of whom blame identity politics for spawning or
   justifying a backlash of right-leaning populism in the US. We argue for
   a turn to a more robust definition of identity as multidimensional and
   politically mediated for understanding political alignments over the
   past several decades. The multidimensionality of inequality -
   intersectionality or complex inequality - is widely accepted in the
   study of gender and race across the social science disciplines but has
   yet to be as successfully integrated into studies of electoral politics.
   Thinking about women's positioning in systems of complex inequality, and
   how the political parties have or have not articulated the concerns of
   different groups of women, helps us to understand the 2016 election, as
   well as past and potentially future political developments.

AB The debates relating to social class and whether it is still a useful
   concept in describing a lived reality of the British population has
   never been far away from media, political and academic dispute.
   Thatcher's Britain throughout the 1980s attempted to dilute class
   meaning with what was called a home owning democracy' and thus end class
   collective politics through easily available credit for the working
   class while simultaneously attacking trade union organization,
   recruitment and political action.
   During the late 1990s and into the noughties a New Labour'
   administration attempted to exacerbate the end of class politics through
   an agenda of a cultural distinction' to class identity. Class struggle,
   class politics and class identity is embedded deep within the cultural
   norms practices, and history of British democracy. Consequently it is
   difficult if not impossible to prise class inequality in the UK away

   cultural class distinction, within the UK had the biggest influence in

   viewpoints of working-class communities of East London, and of ex-mining
   towns of Nottinghamshire. Framing into fuller context the anger and
   apathy of being left out', arguing that being left out' has been part of
   working-class political narratives for over 30 years. Going beyond
   frustration and apathy, a significant part of the narrative of working

AB This paper argues that the election of Donald Trump is the product of a
   confluence of historical factors rather than the distinctive appeal of
   the victor himself. By paying particular attention to the geography of
   unusual voting behaviour the analytical question comes into view: why
   did so much uncharacteristic voting occur in the Rust Belt states of the
   upper Midwest? It is impossible to answer this question adequately using
   conventional categorical attributes. The usual hypotheses of economic
   anxiety' and white revanchism are unable to account for sudden shifts in
   the voting behaviour of both white and black voters in post-industrial
   territories. Instead, it is necessary to turn to the history of the
   region and the institutional apparatus that connected voters there to
   the federal government and the Democratic Party. From this perspective
   we can see that the active dismantling of the Fordist social order set
   the region on a divergent path from the rest of the country. But this
   path had no political outlet due to the reorientation of the Democratic
   Party around a new class and geographic base. Due to this, the party
   pursued policies that would magnify the region's difficulties rather
   than alleviate its circumstances. Moreover, the elaborate institutional
   ties that connected the region's voters to the Democratic Party and the
   federal government meant that the political implications of regional
   decline would be muted. However, as these institutions frayed, Rust Belt
   voters were made available to candidates that challenged the policy
   consensus that had done so much damage to the region. The election was
   decided by a Rust Belt revolt that unified black and white working-class
   voters against Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.

AB Any effort to situate Trump's ascendance in the broader currents of
   cross-national developments, or in the longer course of American
   political development, must begin by recognizing it as a curious hybrid
   of populism and plutocracy. Although American right-wing populism has
   real social roots, it has long been nurtured by powerful elites seeking
   to undercut support for modern structures of economic regulation and the
   welfare state. American political institutions offered a distinctive
   opportunity for a populist figure to draw on this fury to first capture
   the nomination of the GOP, and from that position to ascend to the White
   House. Yet the administration's substantive agenda constitutes a
   full-throated endorsement of the GOP economic elite's long-standing
   demands for cuts in social spending, tax reductions for the wealthy, and
   the gutting of consumer, worker and environmental protections. The chasm
   between Trump's rhetoric and his actions justifies a more skeptical
   assessment of the breadth and depth of American populism, one that
   acknowledges how its contours are shaped by the nation's unusual
   political institutions, its intensifying political polarization and the
   out-sized influence of the wealthy.

AB The labor market increasingly rewards social skills. Between 1980 and
   2012, jobs requiring high levels of social interaction grew by nearly 12
   percentage points as a share of the U.S. labor force. Math-intensive but
   less social jobs-including many STEM occupations-shrank by 3.3
   percentage points over the same period. Employment and wage growth were
   particularly strong for jobs requiring high levels of both math skill
   and social skills. To understand these patterns, I develop a model of
   team production where workers "trade tasks" to exploit their comparative
   advantage. In the model, social skills reduce coordination costs,
   allowing workers to specialize and work together more efficiently. The
   model generates predictions about sorting and the relative returns to
   skill across occupations, which I investigate using data from the NLSY79
   and the NLSY97. Using a comparable set of skill measures and covariates
   across survey waves, I find that the labor market return to social
   skills was much greater in the 2000s than in the mid-1980s and 1990s.

   non-Latino white residents. Our results indicate that growing Latino
   student populations are associated with declining net migration among
   whites. This pattern is particularly strong in non-traditional Latino
   districts, where the presence of Latinos is historically recent, in
   districts that are spatially proximate to those with smaller Latino
   populations, and in districts marked by relatively low internal
   segregation. These findings apply primarily to whites with the closest
   ties to public schools: school-age children and "parent-age" adults
   between the ages of 30 and 49, suggesting that whites' selective
   migration is linked to preferences for public schools with smaller

   objective, that these numbers are frequently biased and reliant on

AB Much of migration theory has come to revolve around the category of the
   "labor migrant," without taking into account labor, like homemaking,
   that remains unrecognized by the market. Drawing from qualitative
   interviews with thirty-one Chinese migrants in different stages of
   making a move from Beijing to Vancouver, we attempt to bring better
   visibility to how the labor involved in homemaking intersects with
   migration. Defining homemaking as work in the pragmatic-existentialist
   context of the stabilization of everyday routines, we uncover three
   themes to homemaking work: settling in, settling down, and settling for.
   Discussion of these themes reveals two important issues for migration
   theory: settlement relies upon the work of homemaking and the work of
   homemaking in many cases motivates migration. For these reasons, the
   work of homemaking should be more carefully studied within the migration
   literature.

AB Long-term trends in the federal income poverty measure are well
   documented and researched, but long-term trends in material hardship, as
   an alternative measure of economic well-being, are much less well known.
   In part, this is because data limitations have precluded the study of
   material hardship at multiple data points over time. Using data from the
   2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation and repeat observations
   approximately one year apart, this paper uses probit models to analyze
   separately four domains of material hardship (i.e., food insecurity,
   housing hardship, medical hardship and essential expense hardship) in
   order to identify demographic characteristics that are associated with
   whether hardships occur and if they are one-time or repeated. The key
   findings are: 1) across all four domains, experiences of material
   hardship are evenly split between one-time and repeated, 2) across all
   four domains, exits from hardship are matched by entrances into
   hardship, and 3) some demographic factors, such as disability status,
   are strong and consistent predictors of material hardship across domains
   and recurrence, while other demographic factors, such as living in a
   metropolitan area or not, affect domains and recurrence of hardship
   differently. This analysis not only improves our understanding of how
   material hardship operates in households, but also demonstrates how
   material hardship can be a more nuanced and robust measure of economic
   well-being. Together with future research, these findings can help
   policymakers create more targeted and effective interventions that help
   all Americans make ends meet.

AB National civic integration programs for non-European migrants have
   become increasingly common across Europe. While the official purpose of
   these programs is to facilitate migrants' entry into society, scholars
   argue that they may actually reinforce the boundaries that separate
   migrants from the national community. To address this potential paradox,
   I propose a theoretical framework that combines the concepts of
   racialization and symbolic boundaries and effectively locates
   integration programs in the long historical relationship between
   Europeans and non-Europeans. In applying this framework, this article
   draws on an ethnography of the French civic integration program - the
   "Reception and Integration Contract" - and interviews with program
   staff. I find that the program represents the French nation as modern,
   secular, and striving towards gender equality, and immigrants as
   traditional with patriarchal gender relations and public religious
   practices that conflict with the values of the French Republic. Using
   these representations, the program discursively draws racialized
   boundaries between the French nation and participating migrants based on
   language, culture, and religion. While program personnel with immigrant
   origins challenge and blur these boundaries, they also often reinforce
   them and facilitate this process of racialization. Overall, the
   essentialist and hierarchical representations within the program
   discourses appear to reproduce the historical contrast between European
   and non-European and limit the possibilities for boundary crossing and
   entry into the nation.

AB How can cultural understandings simultaneously diverge from and
   contribute to aggregate patterns of action? On one hand, shared
   cognitive associations guide people's everyday actions, and these
   actions comprise the behavioral trends that sociologists seek to measure
   and understand. On the other hand, these shared understandings often
   contradict behavioral trends. I address this theoretical puzzle by
   considering the empirical case of sexual relationships and school
   dropout in Malawi. Moving recursively between longitudinal survey data
   and in-depth interviews, I compare statistical patterns and cultural
   beliefs about the relationship between sexual relationships and school
   dropout. Interviewees emphasized ways that relationships render girls
   incapable of continuing in school, whereas survey data provide limited
   support for these posited causal processes. However, these shared
   beliefs about the detrimental effects of relationships for school
   performance have real effects: teachers, parents, and students act as if
   these narratives were true, and these behavioral responses sustain the
   broader antinomy between sex and schooling. This analysis reveals new
   insights into how cultural understandings-and the various ways people
   respond to and enforce them-contribute to the demographic patterns we
   observe using survey data.

AB Randomized experiments are increasingly used to study political
   phenomena because they can credibly estimate the average effect of a
   treatment on a population of interest. But political scientists are
   often interested in how effects vary across subpopulations-heterogeneous
   treatment effects-and how differences in the content of the treatment
   affects responses-the response to heterogeneous treatments. Several new
   methods have been introduced to estimate heterogeneous effects, but it
   is difficult to know if a method will perform well for a particular data
   set. Rather than using only one method, we show how an ensemble of
   methods-weighted averages of estimates from individual models
   increasingly used in machine learning-accurately measure heterogeneous
   effects. Building on a large literature on ensemble methods, we show how
   the weighting of methods can contribute to accurate estimation of
   heterogeneous treatment effects and demonstrate how pooling models lead
   to superior performance to individual methods across diverse problems.
   We apply the ensemble method to two experiments, illuminating how the
   ensemble method for heterogeneous treatment effects facilitates
   exploratory analysis of treatment effects.

AB There is increasing interest in experiments where outcomes are measured

   such as by mailers, door-to-door canvasses, phone calls, or online ads.
   However, common designs for such experiments are often prohibitively
   expensive, vulnerable to bias, and raise ethical concerns. We show how
   four methodological practices currently uncommon in such experiments
   have previously undocumented complementarities that can dramatically
   relax these constraints when at least two are used in combination: (1)
   online surveys recruited from a defined sampling frame (2) with at least
   one baseline wave prior to treatment (3) with multiple items combined
   into an index to measure outcomes and, (4) when possible, a placebo
   control. We provide a general and extensible framework that allows
   researchers to determine the most efficient mix of these practices in
   diverse applications. Two then examine how these practices perform
   empirically. First, we examine the representativeness of online panel
   respondents recruited from a defined sampling frame and find that their
   representativeness compares favorably to phone panel respondents.
   Second, an original experiment successfully implements all four
   practices in the context of a door-to-door canvassing experiment. We
   conclude discussing potential extensions.

AB We discuss a statistical procedure to carry out empirical research that

   Researchers send their datasets to an independent third party who
   randomly generates training and testing samples. Researchers perform
   their analysis on the training sample and are able to incorporate
   feedback from both colleagues, editors, and referees. Once the paper is
   accepted for publication the method is applied to the testing sample and
   it is those results that are published. Simulations indicate that, under
   empirically relevant settings, the proposed method delivers more power
   than a PAP. The effect mostly operates through a lower likelihood that
   relevant hypotheses are left untested. The method appears better suited
   for exploratory analyses where there is significant uncertainty about
   the outcomes of interest. We do not recommend using the method in
   situations where the treatment are very costly and thus the available
   sample size is limited. An interpretation of the method is that it
   allows researchers to perform direct replication of their work. We also
   discuss a number of practical issues about the method's feasibility and

AB Due to the crucial role of political knowledge in democratic
   participation, the measurement of political knowledge has been a major
   concern in the discipline of political science. Common formats used for
   political knowledge questions include multiple-choice items and
   open-ended identification questions. The conventional wisdom holds that
   multiple-choice items induce guessing behavior, which leads to
   underestimated item-difficulty parameters and biased estimates of
   political knowledge. This article examines guessing behavior in
   multiple-choice items and argues that a successful guess requires
   certain levels of knowledge conditional on the difficulties of items. To
   deal with this issue, we propose a Bayesian IRT guessing model that
   accommodates the guessing components of item responses. The proposed
   model is applied to analyzing survey data in Taiwan, and the results
   show that the proposed model appropriately describes the guessing
   components based on respondents' levels of political knowledge and item
   characteristics. That is, in general, partially informed respondents are
   more likely to have a successful guess because well-informed respondents
   do not need to guess and barely informed ones are highly seducible by
   the attractive distractors. We also examine the gender gap in political
   knowledge and find that, even when the guessing effect is accounted for,
   men are more knowledgeable than women about political affairs, which is
   consistent with the literature.

   measures do not coincide when parties care about multiple issues. We
   show that forward-looking parties have an incentive to implement
   policies favored by the representative voter, in an attempt to constrain
   future challengers. This incentive grows as antagonism increases. On the

AB One of the puzzles about the financial crisis of 2008 is why regulators,
   particularly the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), were so slow to
   recognize the impending collapse of the financial system and its broader
   consequences for the economy. We use theory from the literature on
   culture, cognition, and framing to explain this puzzle. Consistent with
   recent work on "positive asymmetry," we show how the FOMC generally
   interpreted discomforting facts in a positive light, marginalizing and
   normalizing anomalous information. We argue that all frames limit what
   can be understood, but the content of frames matters for how facts are
   identified and explained. We provide evidence that the Federal Reserve's
   primary frame for making sense of the economy was macroeconomic theory.
   The content of macroeconomics made it difficult for the FOMC to connect
   events into a narrative reflecting the links between foreclosures in the
   housing market, the financial instruments used to package the mortgages
   into securities, and the threats to the larger economy. We conclude with
   implications for the sociological literatures on framing and cognition
   and for decision-making in future crises.

AB In this article, we propose a new explanation for why certain cultural
   products outperform their peers to achieve widespread success. We argue
   that products' position in feature space significantly predicts their
   popular success. Using tools from computer science, we construct a novel
   dataset allowing us to examine whether the musical features of nearly
   27,000 songs from Billboard's Hot 100 charts predict their levels of
   success in this cultural market. We find that, in addition to artist
   familiarity, genre affiliation, and institutional support, a song's
   perceived proximity to its peers influences its position on the charts.
   Contrary to the claim that all popular music sounds the same, we find
   that songs sounding too much like previous and contemporaneous
   productions-those that are highly typical-are less likely to succeed.
   Songs exhibiting some degree of optimal differentiation are more likely
   to rise to the top of the charts. These findings offer a new perspective
   on success in cultural markets by specifying how content organizes
   product competition and audience consumption behavior.

AB This article examines the intersection of two structural developments:
   the growth of surveillance and the rise of "big data." Drawing on
   observations and interviews conducted within the Los Angeles Police
   Department, I offer an empirical account of how the adoption of big data
   analytics does-and does not-transform police surveillance practices. I
   argue that the adoption of big data analytics facilitates amplifications
   of prior surveillance practices and fundamental transformations in
   surveillance activities. First, discretionary assessments of risk are
   supplemented and quantified using risk scores. Second, data are used for
   predictive, rather than reactive or explanatory, purposes. Third, the
   proliferation of automatic alert systems makes it possible to
   systematically surveil an unprecedentedly large number of people.
   Fourth, the threshold for inclusion in law enforcement databases is
   lower, now including individuals who have not had direct police contact.
   Fifth, previously separate data systems are merged, facilitating the
   spread of surveillance into a wide range of institutions. Based on these
   findings, I develop a theoretical model of big data surveillance that
   can be applied to institutional domains beyond the criminal justice
   system. Finally, I highlight the social consequences of big data
   surveillance for law and social inequality.

AB Principal-agent problems plagued early modern corporations. The existing
   literature emphasizes the potential benefits provided by private trade
   in aligning the interests of company agents to those of their
   principals. We contribute to this line of work by analyzing the
   organizational and social mechanisms that may help address
   principal-agent problems in the presence of private trading
   opportunities. Drawing on personnel records of more than half a million
   seafarers employed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) over nearly a
   century, we show that monitoring was effective in reducing desertion
   when private trade was conceived as a market activity subordinated to
   hierarchy. Social bonds were more effective in preventing desertion when
   the company elevated private trade above hierarchy. Our analysis
   clarifies how early corporations could maintain control over a
   geographically dispersed and diverse labor force in the absence of
   modern tools of organizational governance.

AB The effect of generous welfare benefits on unemployment is highly
   contested. The dominant perspective contends that benefits provide
   disincentive to work, whereas others portray benefits as job-search
   subsidies that facilitate better job matches. Despite many studies of
   welfare benefits and unemployment, the literature has neglected how this
   relationship might vary across institutional contexts. This article
   investigates how unemployment benefits and minimum income benefits
   affect unemployment across levels of the institutional insider/outsider
   divide. I analyze the moderating role of the disparity in employment
   protection for holders of permanent and temporary contracts and of the
   configuration of wage bargaining. The analysis combines data from 20
   European countries and the United States using the European Union Labour
   Force Survey and the Current Population Survey 1992-2009. I use a
   pseudo-panel approach, including fixed effects for sociodemographic
   groups within countries and interactions between benefits and
   institutions. The results indicate that unemployment benefits and
   minimum income benefits successfully subsidize job search and reduce
   unemployment in labor markets with a moderate institutional
   insider/outsider divide. However, when there is greater disparity in
   employment protection and when bargaining either combines low
   unionization with high centralization or high unionization with low
   centralization, generous benefits create a disincentive to work,
   plausibly because attractive job opportunities are scarce.

AB Sociologists have long examined how states, intergovernmental
   organizations (IGOs), international nongovernmental organizations
   (INGOs), and professional groups interact in order to institutionalize
   their preferred norms at the transnational level. Yet, explanations of
   global norm-making that emphasize inter-organizational negotiations do
   not adequately explain the intra-organizational script-writing-that is,
   the codification of norms in prescriptive behavioral templates-that
   underpins this process. This article opens the black box of how scripts
   emerge and institutionalize within IGOs. Script-writing is a function of
   both world-cultural frames and material interests, held by different
   intra-organizational actors: scientific IGO staff and state
   representatives in governing bodies, respectively. The interplay between
   these frames and interests determines whether scripts will
   institutionalize. In this theoretical model, world-cultural and
   power-political explanations are pertinent to different, mutually
   informing, and coexisting aspects of the script-writing process. As a
   corollary of our approach, we present a conceptual framework for the
   study of intra-IGO script-writing, which is contingent on three
   normative struggles: among IGO staff, within an IGO's board of
   directors, and between the staff and the board. To empirically
   substantiate our arguments, we examine scripts on taxation and capital
   controls by the International Monetary Fund. We conclude by discussing
   the broader implications of our model for the study of international
   organizations and the engines of global norm-making.

AB In this comment, I identify two methodological issues in McClintock's
   (2014) article on beauty exchange. First, McClintock's difference
   models, which find no evidence of exchange, are poor measures of
   exchange that fail to account for important confounders and rely on an
   overly narrow conceptualization of exchange. Second, McClintock codes
   her log-linear models to find a difference in the effect of men's and
   women's beauty in exchange rather than the total effect of women's
   beauty, which is both statistically significant and substantively large.

AB In my article, "Beauty and Status: The Illusion of Exchange in Partner
   Selection?" (McClintock 2014), I used descriptive statistics, three
   forms of regression, and six measures of socioeconomic status to examine
   the "trophy wife" stereotype that women "exchange" their beauty for
   men's status. According to the stereotype, such women would partner with
   comparatively less-attractive men who are comparatively high in
   socioeconomic status. I found little support for beauty-status exchange,
   and this limited support lacked robustness. Gullickson critiques my
   analysis on two grounds, arguing against the difference-based regression
   models, and proposing a new specification of interaction effects in the
   log-linear models. However, the difference models conceptualize exchange
   as defined in the relevant literature, and Gullickson's modified
   difference models only replicate my conventional regression models,
   providing no new evidence for or against beauty-status exchange.
   Likewise, Gullickson's proposed log-linear specifications are not only
   non-hierarchical, they also fail to improve model fit or to support
   exchange when using alternative measures of status. Indeed, Gullickson
   focuses on the only measure of status that yields any support for
   beauty-status exchange. Altogether, Gullickson's case for beauty-status
   exchange overlooks the preponderance of contrary evidence and
   prioritizes statistical significance, attainable only under narrow model
   specifications, over robustness and model fit.

   health exams does not significantly alter smoking behavior because (a)
   signals of biomarker health are noisy within individuals, (b) the
   influence of biomarkers on major health outcomes is small, and (c)
   cigarette smoking is addictive. This paper also presents evidence of
   selection in smoking that, when not modeled, may cause an overstatement
   of the effect of smoking on expected longevity.

   This phenomenon is evident throughout three decades worth of microdata

AB Scholars argue that states undertake foreign military interventions for
   economic reasons, yet few have investigated whether intervention
   produces economic benefits. This article answers this question in the
   context of US foreign-imposed regime changes (FIRCs) in Latin America.
   Because FIRCs install leaders who are sympathetic to the intervener's
   interests, economic arguments maintain that these interventions should
   increase bilateral trade between the targets and imposing countries. Yet
   security-based arguments assert that FIRCs should have little economic
   effect, as regime changes target threats rather than generate economic
   benefits. A third perspective argues that FIRCs reduce trade by
   generating political instability, which causes foreign firms to cut back
   on their involvement and domestic firms to experience difficulty getting
   goods to market. To test these competing arguments, this study employs a
   novel dataset on bilateral trade (1873-2007) compiled through archival
   research in Washington, DC. Using a gravity model and synthetic
   controls, it finds that FIRC produces an average decrease of 45 per cent
   in the dollar value of bilateral trade. Further analysis of archival
   sector-level data and case studies cast doubt on alternate explanations.

   because voters who might have voted for a unified party under closed

   solves commitment problems and addresses the root causes of civil
   conflict. Statistical tests utilizing new data on the implementation of

AB Why do challengers attack some states that have allies, while avoiding
   conflict with others? This article builds upon previous research by
   arguing that parity in the observable capabilities of opposing states
   and their allies generates greater uncertainty and miscalculations on
   the part of challengers, which leads to a higher probability of
   conflict. Unlike previous research, however, this article argues that
   military alliances among democracies are better able to overcome this
   uncertainty, making power distributions largely irrelevant. The results
   demonstrate that uncertainty generated at power parity is mitigated when
   a target state's allies are more democratic, resulting in no overall
   change in the probability of conflict. This study therefore emphasizes
   that the effectiveness of military alliances lies not necessarily in
   their aggregation of power, but in their ability to co-ordinate their
   power and communicate this co-ordination to potential challengers.

AB Socialization theory claims that the ability of education to reduce

   authorities are not equally committed to accepting ethnic minorities:
   higher educated persons harbor less anti-foreigner sentiment because
   they spend longer in educational institutions that impose official

   minorities. Consequently, higher educated persons ought to diverge from
   the lower educated as democratic institutions progress. Analyses support
   these claims: the impact of education on reducing anti-foreigner
   sentiment is strongest in the oldest democracies, moderate among the
   medium-aged (e.g., South European) democracies and weakest among the
   youngest (East European) democracies; and higher educated persons are

AB Prior scholarship overlooks the capacity of other actors to raise the
   political costs of unilateral action by turning public opinion against
   the president. Through a series of five experiments embedded in
   nationally representative surveys, we demonstrate Congress's ability to
   erode support for unilateral actions by raising both constitutional and
   policy-based objections to the exercise of unilateral power.
   Congressional challenges to the unilateral president diminish support
   for executive action across a range of policy areas in both the foreign
   and domestic realm and are particularly influential when they explicitly
   argue that presidents are treading on congressional prerogatives. We
   also find evidence that constitutional challenges are more effective
   when levied by members of Congress than by other actors. The results
   resolve a debate in the literature and suggest a mechanism through which
   Congress might exercise a constraint on the president, even when it is
   unable to check him legislatively.

AB A growing experimental literature uses response rates to fictional
   requests to measure discrimination against ethnic minorities. This
   article argues that restricting attention to response rates can lead to
   faulty inferences about substantive discrimination depending on how
   response dummies are correlated with other response characteristics. We
   illustrate the relevance of this problem by means of a conjoint
   experiment among all German welfare offices, in which we randomly varied
   five traits and designed requests to allow for a substantive coding of
   response quality. We find that response rates are statistically
   indistinguishable across treatment conditions. However, putative
   non-Germans receive responses of significantly lower quality,
   potentially deterring them from applying for benefits. We also find
   observational evidence suggesting that discrimination is more pronounced
   in welfare offices run by local governments than in those embedded in
   the national bureaucracy. We discuss implications for the study of
   equality in the public sphere.

   negativity biases in perception and judgment, we devise a theoretical
   framework to articulate why vicarious experiences magnify racial and
   ethnic disparities in evaluations of judicial actors. Four hypotheses
   are tested using original survey data from the state of Washington.
   Results provide strong evidence that vicarious experiences influence
   citizens' evaluations of both police and courts, and they do so in a

AB Does political violence leave a lasting legacy on identities, attitudes,

   and that families transmit these effects across generations. Inherited
   identities then impact the contemporary attitudes and behaviors of the
   descendants of victims. Testing these hypotheses is fraught with
   methodological challenges; to overcome them, we study the deportation of
   Crimean Tatars in 1944 and the indiscriminate way deportees died from
   starvation and disease. We conducted a multigenerational survey of
   Crimean Tatars in 2014 and find that the descendants of individuals who
   suffered more intensely identify more strongly with their ethnic group,
   support more strongly the Crimean Tatar political leadership, hold more
   hostile attitudes toward Russia, and participate more in politics. But
   we find that victimization has no lasting effect on religious
   radicalization. We also provide evidence that identities are passed down
   from the victims of the deportation to their descendants.

AB Political brokers mobilize voters all over the world, yet little is

   two drivers of brokers' efforts: (1) incentivesmonetary rewards or
   sanctionsand monitoring and (2) partisan attachment. We examine our
   theory using data on the Mexican National Educational Workers Union
   (SNTE), Latin America's largest union and a well-known political
   machine. Consistent with the role of teachers as brokers, we find that
   the vote share of parties supported by the SNTE machine is higher in
   polling stations located in schools. This effect is absent when teachers
   are asked to mobilize voters in support of a party for which they have
   no partisan attachment, and it is uncorrelated with the union's
   monitoring capacity. This suggests that partisan attachment, rather than
   incentives and monitoring, explains the SNTE's effectiveness as a
   political machine.

AB A hallmark finding in the study of public opinion is that many citizens
   approach the political realm with one-sided attitudes that color their
   judgments, making attitude change difficult. This finding highlights the
   importance of citizens with weak prior attitudes, since they might
   represent a segment of the electorate that is more susceptible to
   influence. The judgment processes of citizens with weak attitudes,
   however, are poorly understood. Drawing from dual-process models in
   psychology, I test the idea that citizens with weak explicit attitudes
   rely on implicit attitudes as they render political judgments. I find
   support for this conjecture in experimental and observational data.
   There are two main contributions. First, I show that an important and
   understudied segment of the electorate arrives at political decisions
   via automatic (but nonetheless predictable) mental processes. Second, I
   characterize the conditions under which implicit political attitudes
   matter more and less.

AB Despite rapid urbanization across the Global South, identity politics
   within rural-urban migrant communities remains understudied. Past
   scholarship is divided over whether village-based ethnic divisions will
   erode or deepen within diverse poor migrant populations. I assess these
   divergent predictions through an ethnographic survey experiment'
   (N=4,218) among unique samples of poor migrants in India. Contra
   conventional expectations, I find intra-class ethnic divisions are
   neither uniformly transcended nor entrenched across key arenas of
   migrant life. Instead, I observe variation consistent with situational
   theories predicting ethnic divisions will be muted only in contexts
   triggering a common identity among migrants. I pinpoint urban employers
   and politicians as these triggers. Poor migrants ignore ethnic divisions
   when facing these elites, who perceive and treat them in class terms.
   However, migrants remain divided in direct interactions with each other.
   These bifurcated findings imply poor migrants may be available for both
   class-based and ethnic mobilization in the city.

AB Women are dramatically underrepresented in legislative bodies, and most
   scholars agree that the greatest limiting factor is the lack of female
   candidates (supply). However, voters' subconscious biases (demand) may
   also play a role, particularly among conservatives. We designed an
   original field experiment to test whether messages from party leaders
   can affect women's electoral success. The experimental treatments
   involved messages from a state Republican Party chair to the leaders of
   1,842 precinct-level caucus meetings. We find that party leaders'
   efforts to stoke both supply and demand (and especially both together)
   increase the number of women elected as delegates to the statewide
   nominating convention. We replicate this finding in a survey experiment
   with a national sample of validated Republican primary election voters
   (N = 2,897). Our results suggest that simple interventions from party
   leaders can affect the behavior of candidates and voters and ultimately
   lead to a substantial increase in women's descriptive representation.

AB The institution of citizen suits is a decentralized form of public
   participation that allows citizens to influence the implementation of

   This article proposes a model of citizen suits. It then analyzes how
   this institution influences legislative decisions. The legislature
   bargains to choose the budget, distributive spending, and spending on an
   ideologically contested public good (e.g., health care or environmental
   protection). I find that citizen suits enable courts to forge a
   compromise between opponents and proponents of the public good by
   responding to the diverse claims of citizens. Anticipating the
   mobilization of citizens in courts, legislators in turn craft more
   socially efficient bills, with less distributive spending, which better
   represent the distribution of preferences for the public good compared
   to when citizens have no role in the implementation of legislation.

   benefits from giving the elected politician discretion to adapt policies
   to his information. But limits on discretion are desirable when
   politicians do not share the electorate's policy preferences. Optimal
   political representation generally consists of a mixture of the delegate
   (no discretion) and trustee (full discretion) models. Ambiguous
   electoral platforms are essential for achieving beneficial
   representation. Nevertheless, electoral competition does not ensure
   optimal representation: The winning candidate's platform is generally
   overly ambiguous. While our theory rationalizes a positive correlation
   between ambiguity and electoral success, it shows that the relationship

AB The (unheralded) first step in many applications of automated text
   analysis involves selecting keywords to choose documents from a large
   text corpus for further study. Although all substantive results depend
   on this choice, researchers usually pick keywords in ad hoc ways that
   are far from optimal and usually biased. Most seem to think that keyword
   selection is easy, since they do Google searches every day, but we
   demonstrate that humans perform exceedingly poorly at this basic task.
   We offer a better approach, one that also can help with following
   conversations where participants rapidly innovate language to evade
   authorities, seek political advantage, or express creativity; generic
   web searching; eDiscovery; look-alike modeling; industry and
   intelligence analysis; and sentiment and topic analysis. We develop a
   computer-assisted (as opposed to fully automated or human-only)
   statistical approach that suggests keywords from available text without
   needing structured data as inputs. This framing poses the statistical
   problem in a new way, which leads to a widely applicable algorithm. Our
   specific approach is based on training classifiers, extracting
   information from (rather than correcting) their mistakes, and
   summarizing results with easy-to-understand Boolean search strings. We
   illustrate how the technique works with analyses of English texts about
   the Boston Marathon bombings, Chinese social media posts designed to
   evade censorship, and others.

   that the front-door and front-door difference-in-differences estimators

   We illustrate these points with an application to a job training study
   and with an application to Florida's early in-person voting program. For
   the job training study, we show that these techniques can recover an

   available, the modeling is restricted to a few variables. This article
   introduces multilevel regression with synthetic poststratification
   (MrsP), which relaxes the data requirement of MrP to marginal
   distributions, substantially increases the prediction precision of the
   method, and extends its use to countries without census data. The
   findings of Monte Carlo, U.S., and Swiss analyses show that, using the
   same predictors, MrsP usually performs in standard applications as well
   as the currently used standard approach, and it is superior when
   additional predictors are modeled. The better performance and the more

AB There is an ongoing debate in the field of social mobility research
   about whether intergenerational social mobility can be increased by way
   of education policy. However, evidence on the effects of specific
   education policies on social mobility continues to be scarce. This
   article analyses the effect of one specific policy reform, the extension
   of compulsory schooling in Germany, which has been argued to have led to
   a decrease in educational inequality and an increase in social mobility.
   Using a difference-in-difference design, the article exploits the
   variation in the timing of the reform across German states to estimate
   the reform effect on the educational attainment and labour market
   chances of individuals from different social class backgrounds. We find
   that the reform resulted in a substantial narrowing of the gap in
   educational attainment between different social origin groups. This
   decline in educational inequality further translated into a reduction in
   the inequality in labour market chances between people from different
   social class backgrounds, thus increasing intergenerational social
   mobility. Our findings suggest that educational policy can lead to
   substantial increases in intergenerational social mobility, which may
   have been overlooked in past research on societal-level, long-run trends

AB In contemporary societies, travelling intensively to and for work has
   become an important part in many people's lives. A life course approach
   suggests that spatial mobility may, however, conflict with other life
   domains such as fertility, especially for women. Using longitudinal
   survey data from France, Germany, Spain, and Switzerland, our study
   provides novel evidence that the interdependence of fertility and
   work-related spatial mobility behaviours is largely shaped by national
   contexts. Based on innovative techniques of sequence analysis, our
   results indicate that long-term experiences of daily and weekly
   long-distance commuting and overnight work travel are associated with
   lower fertility mainly among women in Germany and Switzerland. In France
   and Spain, the association is weaker or absent. Interestingly, male
   overnight travellers in Germany and Switzerland show similar tendencies.
   These men have a comparatively lower fertility than other men, although
   the cross-national differences are less pronounced than among women. Our
   study discusses the role of national family policies, social norms, and
   labour market structures in facilitating or hindering the reconciliation
   between fertility and work-related spatial mobility.

AB In contrast to previous, single-gender studies on step-parents'
   participation in childcare, I use the pooled Generations and Gender
   Survey to address the following questions: (i) Is there a gender
   difference in the potential divergence in how childcare is organized in
   two-biological-parent and step-parent households (i.e. are there larger
   differences between type-of-mother and type-of-father families)? and
   (ii) Does the type of partnership (marital/non-marital cohabitation)
   matter for how childcare is divided in step-parent households and if it
   does, does it matter more for step-mothers or step-fathers? The findings
   from the country-level fixed-effect models show that whereas the
   difference between type-of-father households is negligible, the gap
   between type-of-mother households is significantly larger, particularly,
   in non-marital cohabitations. The findings are more pronounced for the
   division of physical (e.g. taking care of child when sick) than
   interactive (e.g. helping child with homework) tasks. The proposition is
   put forward that these findings stem from the higher ambiguity which
   surrounds the parenting role of step-mothers compared to that of
   step-fathers.

AB It is often shown that temporary employees generally perceive their job
   insecurity to be higher than permanent employees. However, substantial
   variations in this perceived job security gap exist between countries.
   This article engages with this knowledge and adds to it by focusing on
   these country variations and asking what role the strength of employment
   protection legislation (EPL) has both on the size of the job security
   gap and in explaining country differences. The developed hypotheses
   suggest that the two components of EPL-job security provisions,
   indicating the 'protection gap' between permanent and temporary
   employees as well as specific regulations on the use of temporary
   contracts-will increase the job security gap. These hypotheses are
   tested using data from the European Social Survey for 2004 and 2010 and
   data on employment regulations from the Organisation for Economic
   Co-operation and Development. Compared to existing studies, this article
   offers a more detailed look at the operationalization of job security
   provisions and regulations on temporary employment-proposing an
   alternative measurement which is more closely related to the theoretical
   arguments. By using this more elaborate operationalization, the
   multilevel model shows that the gap in perceived job security between
   temporary and permanent employees systematically increases with respect
   to the two components of EPL.

AB This study investigates whether increased availability of low-cost,
   state-subsidized childcare for under 3-year-olds in Germany is
   associated with shorter employment interruptions amongst mothers. By
   focusing on a major childcare reform in East and West Germany, we
   examine the effect in two contexts that differ markedly in the
   acceptance and use of formal childcare and maternal employment. We
   combine rich longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel
   (2006-2014) with annual administrative county-level data on the
   availability of low-cost, state-subsidized childcare, estimating event
   history models. The results indicate that increased childcare
   availability for under 3-year-olds reduces mothers' employment
   interruptions, particularly after a second childbirth, and increases the
   probability of returning to part-time or full-time employment as opposed
   to marginal employment. Furthermore, increased availability of low-cost,
   state-subsidized childcare increases mothers' likelihood of returning to
   employment in the second year after childbirth, when paid leave
   entitlements expire and the availability of childcare becomes important.
   However, our results are only statistically significant for West German
   mothers and only after the birth of a second child. The study extends
   the literature on women's return-to-work behaviour by providing evidence
   on the medium-term impact of family policy on the duration of mothers'
   employment interruptions.

AB This article analyses how differences in the salience of religion as a
   symbolic boundary of the nation among the majority populations in Europe
   can be explained. Following previous studies, I consider individual- and
   country-level characteristics based on theories of social identity and
   ethnic threat in my analyses to explain the variation. In addition, I
   include the institutional relationship between church and state and
   historical manifestations of religious nationalism as additional context
   conditions, which I assume to influence the salience of religious
   boundaries among the population. Drawing on data from the International
   Social Survey Programme, multilevel regression models are applied to
   data from 28 European countries. The results reveal that affiliation
   with the dominant religion as well as individual religiosity and
   perceived ethnic threat influences whether the national community is
   defined in religious terms. At the country level, historical
   manifestations of religious nationalism and a close and supportive
   relation between the state and dominant church increase the salience of
   religious boundaries of the nation, even when controlling for different
   levels of secularization. Thus, cultural narratives and institutional
   settings constitute important frameworks that impact individual
   definitions of national belonging in times of growing religious
   diversity and struggles over immigrant integration.

   individuals who score high on openness, and who therefore are more
   appreciative of and responsive to new experiences, react more
   positively/less negatively to interethnic encounters. We test this
   conjecture on two surveys collected in Denmark and Canada. In line with
   our expectations, the analyses suggest that openness positively
   moderates the effect of interethnic encounters on immigration attitudes:
   compared to those with lower levels of openness, more open individuals
   express more pro-immigration attitudes when experiencing both personal

   We incorporate skill-intensity differences across firms and sectors into

   reallocate factors toward a country's comparative advantage sectors,
   increasing the skill premium in countries with a comparative advantage
   in skill-intensive sectors and decreasing it elsewhere. Reductions in
   trade costs also reallocate factors toward more productive and
   skill-intensive firms within sectors and toward skill-intensive sectors
   in all countries, increasing the skill premium in all countries.
   Quantitatively, we find that trade liberalization increases the skill

   were largely nominal. Wage cuts were larger in cities with higher

   Different parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative, and
   permissive) emerge as equilibrium outcomes and are affected both by
   parental preferences and by the socioeconomic environment. Parenting
   style, in turn, feeds back into the children's welfare and economic
   success. The theory is consistent with the decline of authoritarian

   or value function iteration setup, we interpolate functions using an

   grow much more slowly than standard tensor product grids. Moreover,
   adaptivity adds a second layer of sparsity, as grid points are added
   only where they are most needed, for instance, in regions with steep
   gradients or at nondifferentiabilities. To further speed up the solution
   process, our implementation is fully hybrid parallel, combining
   distributed and shared memory parallelization paradigms, and thus
   permits an efficient use of high-performance computing architectures. To
   demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we solve two very
   different types of dynamic models: first, high-dimensional international
   real business cycle models with capital adjustment costs and
   irreversible investment; second, multiproduct menu-cost models with
   temporary sales and economies of scope in price setting.

AB This note studies some seemingly anomalous results that arise in
   possibly misspecified, reduced-rank linear asset-pricing models
   estimated by the continuously updated generalized method of moments.
   When a spurious factor (that is, a factor that is uncorrelated with the
   returns on the test assets) is present, the test for correct model
   specification has asymptotic power that is equal to the nominal size. In
   other words, applied researchers will erroneously conclude that the
   model is correctly specified even when the degree of misspecification is
   arbitrarily large. The rejection probability of the test for
   overidentifying restrictions typically decreases further in
   underidentified models where the dimension of the null space is larger
   than 1.

   condition in a nonparametric instrumental variable model, known as
   completeness, and it links the outcome of the test to properties of an
   estimator of the structural function. In particular, I show that the
   data can provide empirical evidence in favor of both an arbitrarily
   small identified set as well as an arbitrarily small asymptotic bias of
   the estimator. This is the case for a large class of complete
   distributions as well as certain incomplete distributions. As a
   byproduct, the results can be used to estimate an upper bound of the
   diameter of the identified set and to obtain an easy to report estimator
   of the identified set itself.

AB Owing to the worldwide shortage of deceased-donor organs for
   transplantation, living donations have become a significant source of
   transplant organs. However, not all willing donors can donate to their
   intended recipients because of medical incompatibilities. These
   incompatibilities can be overcome by an exchange of donors between
   patients. For kidneys, such exchanges have become widespread in the last
   decade with the introduction of optimization and market design
   techniques to kidney exchange. A small but growing number of liver
   exchanges have also been conducted. Over the last two decades, a number
   of transplantation procedures emerged where organs from two living
   donors are transplanted to a single patient. Prominent examples include
   dual-graft liver transplantation, lobar lung transplantation, and
   simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation. Exchange, however, has been
   neither practiced nor introduced in this context. We introduce
   dual-donor organ exchange as a novel transplantation modality, and
   through simulations show that living-donor transplants can be
   significantly increased through such exchanges. We also provide a simple
   theoretical model for dual-donor organ exchange and introduce optimal
   exchange mechanisms under various logistical constraints.

AB The rise of the global network of nation-states has precipitated social
   transformations throughout the world. This article examines the role of
   political and economic globalization in driving fertility convergence
   across countries between 1965 and 2009. While past research has
   typically conceptualized fertility change as a country-level process,
   this study instead employs a theoretical and methodological framework
   that examines differences in fertility between pairs of countries over
   time. Convergence in fertility between pairs of countries is
   hypothesized to result from increased cross-country connectedness and
   cross-national transmission of fertility-related schemas. I investigate
   the impact of various cross-country ties, including ties through
   bilateral trade, intergovernmental organizations, and regional trade
   blocs, on fertility convergence. I find that globalization acts as a
   form of social interaction to produce fertility convergence. There is
   significant heterogeneity in the effects of different cross-country
   ties. In particular, trade with rich model countries, joint
   participation in the UN and UNESCO, and joining a free trade agreement
   all contribute to fertility convergence between countries. Whereas the
   prevailing focus in fertility research has been on factors producing
   fertility declines, this analysis highlights specific mechanisms-trade
   and connectedness through organizations-leading to greater similarity in
   fertility across countries. Globalization is a process that propels the
   spread of culturally laden goods and schemas impinging on fertility,
   which in turn produces fertility convergence.

AB A growing number of school districts use centralized assignment
   mechanisms to allocate school seats in a manner that reflects student
   preferences and school priorities. Many of these assignment schemes use
   lotteries to ration seats when schools are oversubscribed. The resulting
   random assignment opens the door to credible quasi-experimental research
   designs for the evaluation of school effectiveness. Yet the question of
   how best to separate the lottery-generated randomization integral to
   such designs from non-random preferences and priorities remains open.
   This paper develops easily-implemented empirical strategies that fully
   exploit the random assignment embedded in a wide class of mechanisms,
   while also revealing why seats are randomized at one school but not
   another. We use these methods to evaluate charter schools in Denver, one
   of a growing number of districts that combine charter and traditional
   public schools in a unified assignment system. The resulting estimates
   show large achievement gains from charter school attendance. Our
   approach generates efficiency gains over ad hoc methods, such as those
   that focus on schools ranked first, while also identifying a more
   representative average causal effect. We also show how to use
   centralized assignment mechanisms to identify causal effects in models
   with multiple school sectors.

AB Stochastic discount factor (SDF) processes in dynamic economies admit a
   permanent-transitory decomposition in which the permanent component
   characterizes pricing over long investment horizons. This paper
   introduces an empirical framework to analyze the permanent-transitory
   decomposition of SDF processes. Specifically, we show how to estimate
   nonparametrically the solution to the Perron-Frobenius eigenfunction
   problem of Hansen and Scheinkman, 2009. Our empirical framework allows
   researchers to (i) construct time series of the estimated permanent and
   transitory components and (ii) estimate the yield and the change of
   measure which characterize pricing over long investment horizons. We
   also introduce nonparametric estimators of the continuation value
   function in a class of models with recursive preferences by
   reinterpreting the value function recursion as a nonlinear
   Perron-Frobenius problem. We establish consistency and convergence rates
   of the eigenfunction estimators and asymptotic normality of the
   eigenvalue estimator and estimators of related functionals. As an
   application, we study an economy where the representative agent is
   endowed with recursive preferences, allowing for general (nonlinear)
   consumption and earnings growth dynamics.

AB Does foreign aid enable or constrain elite capture of public revenues?
   Reflecting on prominent debates in the foreign aid literature, we
   examine whether recipient preferences are consistent with a view that
   foreign donors wield substantial control over the flow of aid dollars,
   making elite capture more difficult and mass benefits more likely. We
   compare elite and mass support for foreign aid versus government
   spending on development projects through a survey experiment with
   behavioral outcomes. A key innovation is a parallel experiment on
   members of the Ugandan national parliament and a representative sample
   of Ugandan citizens. For two actual aid projects, we randomly assigned
   different funders to the projects. Significant treatment effects reveal
   that members of parliament support government programs over foreign aid,
   whereas citizens prefer aid over government. Donor control also implies
   that citizens should favor foreign aid more and elites less as their
   perceptions of government clientelism and corruption increase. We
   explore this and report on other alternative mechanisms. Effects for
   citizens and elites are most apparent for those perceiving significant
   government corruption, suggesting that both sets of subjects perceive
   significant donor control over aid.

AB The recent backlash against globalization in many advanced economies
   raises questions about the source of this protectionist sentiment.
   Traditional accounts generally attribute the welfare consequences of
   trade to skill level or industry characteristics, or instead emphasize
   the nonmaterial determinants of support for openness. Consequently, we
   know little about how a major labor market
   characteristicoccupationshapes both the distributional consequences of
   and preferences toward trade openness. We propose and test a new theory
   of trade policy preferences based on occupation characteristics. Drawing
   from the tasks literature in economics, we argue that occupation
   characteristics are a key determinant of how trade affects workers and
   thus individuals' trade preferences. Our theory suggests that, in
   advanced economies, individuals in routine-task-intensive occupations
   will be negatively affected by trade, and thus more protectionist. This
   relationship will increase in the degree to which occupation job tasks
   can be provided from a distance (i.e., offshorable). We find support for
   our theory using data from the 2003 and 2013 International Social Survey
   Programme in high-income democracies. Our results suggest that the
   occupational characteristics of routineness and offshorability are
   important determinants of trade preferences, offering additional
   understanding of the sources of protectionist sentiment even after
   controlling for labor market characteristics suggested by conventional
   wisdom.

AB This paper explores the question of how major powers signal support for
   their proteges. We develop a theory that explains why major powers show
   support for some proteges using highly visible frontstage signals of
   support, while supporting other proteges through less visible, but
   nonetheless costly, offstage signals. From an international strategic
   perspective, it is puzzling that major powers do not always send the
   most visible signal possible. We argue that this can be explained by
   considering the domestic environments in which the leaders of major
   powers and proteges operate. Focusing particularly on the United States
   as we develop our theory, we argue that the US will prefer to send
   offstage signals of support for more autocratic proteges for several
   reasons. First, sending frontstage support signals for autocracies would
   expose US leaders to charges of hypocrisy. Second, frontstage signals of
   support for autocracies face an impediment to credibility because of the
   public backlash in the United States that overt support for dictators
   could generate. Third, many autocratic proteges would be reluctant to
   accept a frontstage signal of support from the US because it could
   undermine their regime stability. We test our theory in a data set that
   records various support signals sent by the United States for other
   countries between 1950 and 2008, finding strong support for our
   expectations. We also find evidence of the causal mechanisms posited by
   our theory in a case study of relations between the US and the Shah's
   Iran.

AB Aid donors pursue a strategy of targeted development with regard to
   recipient states. The determinants of aid allocation have shifted
   significantly. Industrialized states are increasingly unable to insulate
   themselves from spillovers caused by underdevelopment abroad. Donors
   attempt to use aid to decrease these spillovers, targeting developing
   countries where the effects on the donor are anticipated to be large.
   Once a recipient is chosen, concern for recipient government capacity
   guides the composition of aid. Empirical analysis of aid allocation from
   1973 to 2012 demonstrates that, while explanations based on security and
   economic ties to the donor explain allocation well in the Cold War, the
   post-2001 period is best understood by incorporating a role for targeted
   development. This framework helps synthesize various findings in the aid
   allocation literature and has important implications for studying aid
   effectiveness.

AB The rapid growth of trust funds at multilateral development
   organizations has been widely neglected in the academic literature. We
   examine sovereign donors' choices among various trust fund options and
   contend that the choice among the different trust funds involves a
   fundamental trade-off: larger funds provide donors with burden-sharing
   benefits, but each donor can better assert its individual preferences in
   a fund with fewer other donors. The theoretical considerations yield
   testable hypotheses on a range of factors affecting this fundamental
   trade-off, most notably the area of the trust fund's intervention and
   donor countries' competing domestic interests. A large-N analysis of
   participation decisions of OECD/DAC donors in trust funds over the past
   decade mostly corroborates these hypotheses. In particular, ex ante
   preference alignment among donors as well as indicators for global
   activities and fragile states aid are robust determinants of
   participation in (large) multi-donor funds. In contrast, a donor tends
   to prefer a single-donor fund in areas where its national interests
   dominate.

AB National security is one of many fields where experts make vague
   probability assessments when evaluating high-stakes decisions. This
   practice has always been controversial, and it is often justified on the
   grounds that making probability assessments too precise could bias
   analysts or decision makers. Yet these claims have rarely been submitted
   to rigorous testing. In this paper, we specify behavioral concerns about
   probabilistic precision into falsifiable hypotheses which we evaluate
   through survey experiments involving national security professionals.
   Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that decision makers responding
   to quantitative probability assessments are less willing to support
   risky actions and more receptive to gathering additional information.
   Yet we also find that when respondents estimate probabilities
   themselves, quantification magnifies overconfidence, particularly among
   low-performing assessors. These results hone wide-ranging concerns about
   probabilistic precision into a specific and previously undocumented bias
   that training may be able to correct.

AB Using a population-based survey experiment, this study evaluates the
   role of in-group favoritism in influencing American attitudes toward
   international trade. By systematically altering which countries gain or
   lose from a given trade policy (Americans and/or people in trading
   partner countries), we vary the role that in-group favoritism should
   play in influencing preferences. Our results provide evidence of two
   distinct forms of in-group favoritism. The first, and least surprising,
   is that Americans value the well-being of other Americans more than that
   of people outside their own country. Rather than maximize total gains,
   Americans choose policies that maximize in-group well-being. This
   tendency is exacerbated by a sense of national superiority; Americans
   favor their national in-group to a greater extent if they perceive
   Americans to be more deserving. Second, high levels of perceived
   intergroup competition lead some Americans to prefer trade policies that
   benefit the in-group and hurt the out-group over policies that help both
   their own country and the trading partner country. For a policy to
   elicit support, it is important not only that the US benefits, but also
   that the trading partner country loses so that the US achieves a greater
   relative advantage. We discuss the implications of these findings for
   understanding bipartisan public opposition to trade.

AB The modern international order faces profound challenges. Power is
   shifting to non-Western states and diffusing to non-state actors,
   including transnational insurgents. This is more than a power
   transition: it also about culture. Western states now share the stage
   with powers such as China who bring their own cultural values,
   practices, and histories, and new forms of transnational violence are
   justified in the name of religious identity and belief. Some see this as
   a fundamental threat to modern international order, an order created by
   and for the West. Others see the liberal order as uniquely able to
   accommodate states and peoples of diverse cultures. How well equipped is
   IR to contribute to these debates? I review four recent works on the
   future of the modern international order, asking what conceptual,
   theoretical, and empirical resources they offer for understanding the
   relationship between cultural diversity and international order. This
   literature suffers from four limitations: culture is essentialized or
   bracketed; institutions are seen as either simple expressions of
   cultural values or structures that neutralize culture, with their
   recognition function ignored; the structural power of international
   ordershow they produce political and cultural subjectivitiesis
   underappreciated; and international orders are conceived too narrowly as
   orders of sovereign states. To overcome these limitations, I advance a
   new perspective on cultural diversity and international order.
   International orders evolve in heterogeneous cultural contexts, and the
   governance of diversity is a key imperative of order building. In
   response, international orders develop diversity regimes: institutional
   norms and practices that define legitimate units of political authority,
   authorize certain forms of cultural difference, and relate the two.
   These regimes are essential to the legitimacy of international orders,
   but face two interrelated pressures for change: shifts in underlying
   material capabilities, and new claims for cultural recognition, often
   rooted in grievances against past or prevailing forms of recognition.

AB Scholars have debated whether laws can influence public opinion, but
   evidence of these feedback effects is scant. This article examines the
   effect of Arizona's 2010 high-profile anti-immigrant law, SB 1070, on
   both public attitudes and behaviors toward immigrants. Using sentiment
   analysis and a difference-in-difference approach to analyze more than
   250,000 tweets, the author finds that SB 1070 had a negative impact on
   the average sentiment of tweets regarding immigrants, Mexicans, and
   Hispanics, but not on those about Asians or blacks. However, these
   changes in public discourse were not caused by shifting attitudes toward
   immigrants but by the mobilization of anti-immigrant users and by
   motivating new users to begin tweeting. While some scholars propose that
   punitive laws can shape people's attitudes toward targeted groups, this
   study shows that policies are more likely to influence behaviors. Rather
   than placating the electorate, anti-immigrant laws may stir the pot
   further, mobilizing individuals already critical of immigrants.

AB In recent decades, the sociology of the state has become engrossed in
   the relationship between knowledge and modern statecraft. Heeding recent
   calls for society-centered approaches, this article investigates the
   role of nonstate leaders in the production of state knowledge. It takes
   up the following question: How have nonstate leaders (i.e., civil
   leaders and community advocates) contributed to what James Scott has
   termed state legibility? While historical traces suggest that these
   actors have worked to lessen opposition to state projects, this activity
   remains empirically understudied and conceptually underdeveloped.
   Addressed to this problem, this article introduces the concept of
   consent building and proposes an analytic approach that focuses on the
   motivations of nonstate leaders, the obstacles of noncompliance they
   confront, and the persuasive tactics used to foster public cooperation.
   To illustrate the purchase of this approach, it presents a case study of
   local Latino promoters of the 2010 U.S. census. This analysis reveals
   how nonstate leaders can enable, rather than impede, the capacity to see
   like a state.

AB Why is neoliberalization experienced unevenly throughout the Islamic
   world? This article explores Islam-inspired Egyptian and Turkish
   organizations' competing orientations to poverty relief. The study is
   based on interviews, direct observation, and comparative historical
   analysis. While there was a contested balance between neoliberal and
   communitarian orientations to charitable giving in Egypt, in Turkey
   neoliberal approaches marginalized communitarian ones. These differences
   can be traced back to a contrast in the combination of two factors: the
   religious movements and the links between benevolent organizations and
   the state. The relatively more unified Islamic field, which was
   thoroughly merged with the market-friendly state in Turkey, fostered the
   neoliberalization of charity. The fragmented Egyptian Islamic field,
   coupled with an unevenly cooperative (even if still market-friendly)
   state, led to the persistence of an embattled communitarianism. A
   field-based analysis allows us to extend the insights of the uneven
   diffusion literature to micro terrain.

AB In this article, the authors develop a theory of religious change based
   on the linked ecological understanding of the state-building process, to
   tackle the question of why the diverged path of religious change took
   place in South Korea and Taiwan in the 1970s. Specifically, this article
   aims to explain three related puzzles: (1) Given the fact that the
   growth of Christianity in Taiwan and South Korea was similar in the
   1950s, why, in the late 1960s, did Christianity begin to grow
   explosively in South Korea while it stagnated in Taiwan? (2) Why did
   this explosive growth in South Korea occur during the Park Chung Hee
   regime? (3) Why did other religions (e.g., Buddhism) also grow rapidly
   in South Korea during the same period? Using several original materials,
   the authors demonstrate the central role of different state-building
   processes in sparking the diverged religious change in these two
   societies.

AB Structural balance theory attends to a group's network of sentiments and
   posits that this network alters over time toward particular structural
   forms. Current work on the theory is focused on understanding the
   mechanisms that alter sentiments as a function of the configuration of
   sentiments in which they are embedded. Although the theory assumes
   tension reduction mechanisms, there has been no effort to directly
   measure and model the temporal changes of individuals' relational
   tensions that are predicted by the theory. This article elaborates and
   tests balance theory with an empirical analysis of its posited
   interpersonal tensions and their reductions via a sentiment conversion
   process. In addition, the authors open a new line of inquiry on the
   theory's scope conditions and point to a community commitment condition
   that is involved in the realization of structural balance. Their
   analysis draws on a unique suite of multiwave measures obtained from the
   Urban Communes Data Set.

AB Using novel county-level data, the authors document that nearly 25% of
   residential mortgage loans originated between 2003 and 2005 in America
   contained one or more indications of mortgage fraud but also that rates
   were highly variable across counties. Multivariate regression models
   reveal that rates of mortgage fraud were higher in areas with greater
   loan volumes, a larger share of loans originated by independent mortgage
   companies, elevated rates of preexisting property crime, and higher
   levels of black-white racial segregation; it was less prevalent where
   government-sponsored enterprises purchased a larger share of the loans
   sold in secondary mortgage markets. The findings are most consistent
   with classic and contemporary anomie theories and perspectives that
   highlight the geographic targeting of selected housing markets with loan
   products and tactics that provided fertile ground for mortgage fraud.
   The authors discuss the implications of these patterns for developing a
   more comprehensive understanding of contemporary spatial inequalities.

AB There has been a recent, rapid de facto privatization of education in
   many African countries, as the number of private secondary schools
   operating in the region has grown. The majority of these schools are
   "low-cost" private schools where tuition and fees are set as low as
   possible to cover operating costs and still generate profit. Proponents
   of low-cost private schools argue that these schools have proliferated
   in impoverished areas to meet unmet demand for access to education and
   where private schools may offer better quality than locally available
   public schools. Theories of inequality of educational opportunity
   suggest that if private schools offer better-quality education, students
   from more advantaged families will be more likely to enroll at these
   institutions, potentially exacerbating educational inequality in the
   region. This analysis uses data from a school-based longitudinal survey,
   the Malawi Schooling and Adolescent Study, to examine socio-economic
   inequalities in the transition to secondary school and on-time
   enrollment in upper secondary. My findings indicate that youth from
   non-poor households are not only more likely to enroll in secondary
   school than poor youth, but they are also more likely to substitute
   enrollment in private schools for enrollment in second-tier government
   schools. Enrollment at private schools, however, does not yield
   schooling advantages; relative to both tiers of government secondary
   schooling, students who initially enrolled at private schools were the
   least likely to enroll on time in upper secondary school. These patterns
   suggest that these schooling circumstances may yield less segregation of
   opportunity than might otherwise be assumed.

AB The notion that biological memories of environmental experiences can be
   embedded in the human genome and even transmitted transgenerationally is
   increasingly relevant in the postgenomic world, particularly in
   molecular epigenetics, where the genome is conceptualized as porous to
   environmental signals. In this article I discuss the current rethinking
   of race in epigenetic rather than genetic terms, emphasizing some of its
   paradoxical implications, especially for public policy. I claim in
   particular that: (i) if sociologists want to investigate race in a
   postgenomic world they should pay more attention to this novel plastic
   and biosocial view of race; and (ii) there are no reasons to believe
   that an epigenetic view will extinguish race, or that soft-inheritance
   claims will produce a less exclusionary discourse than genetics (hard
   heredity). Quite the opposite, the ground for a re-racialization of
   social debates and the reinforcement of biological boundaries between
   groups are highlighted in the article.

AB Most literature on racial prejudice deals with the racial attitudes of
   the ethnic majority and ethnic minorities separately. This paper breaks
   this tradition. We examine the social distance attitudes of white and
   non-white British residents to test if these attitudes follow the same
   trends over time, whether they are driven by the same social processes
   and whether they are inter-related. We have three main findings.
   Firstly, social distance from other ethnic groups has declined over time
   for both white and ethnic minority Britons. For the white majority there
   are both period and cohort elements to this decline. Secondly, we see
   some evidence that social distance between the majority and minority
   groups is reciprocal. Specifically, minorities who experience rejection
   by the white British feel a greater sense of distance from them.
   Thirdly, we find that all groups share the perception of the same ethnic
   hierarchy. We see evidence of particularly widespread hostility towards
   Muslim Britons from all ethnic groups suggesting that Muslims are
   singled out for negative attention from many British residents of all
   other backgrounds, including a large number who do not express hostility
   to other groups.

AB This paper examines publics of young German Muslims. Case studies
   include the singer Huelya Kandemir, the theatre group Uma Lamo and the
   social network Zahnrader. By focusing on spiritual music publics,
   theatrical comedy publics and social publics, it tries a new approach to
   the way in which we understand minority public engagement. In addition
   to examining the concept of counterpublics, it utilizes the concept of
   participatory culture, which offers a relevant complement. The study
   argues that the publics of young German Muslims display multifaceted
   artistic and civic engagement, which can best be understood in terms of
   participation in cultural or civic productions and contribution to the
   wider German public. Features or effects of counterpublics, such as the
   countering of mainstream representations of minority identities and the
   offering of alternative discourses, are occasionally reflected in their
   activities.

AB In this paper I argue that the intersecting sociologies of ethnicity and
   migration work from a series of interconnected blind spots hindering
   effective analysis of the current UK situation. Both operate
   analytically within the limitations of an immigrant problem' framework;
   are overinvested in state agendas; privilege a nation state analysis;
   are narrowly focused on distributions of migrant bodies, and on
   receiving, at the expense of sending, contexts. Exploring these
   limitations with data derived from a modest small-scale qualitative
   study of young Chinese migrants in London, I argue for a reframing along
   four dimensions. Firstly, in an era of elite migration, sociology could
   reach beyond its immigrant problem framework and open up to a broader
   range of UK migrant ethnicities and circumstances. Secondly, a stronger
   focus on cities as the scale on which lives are lived, and through which
   diverse streams of translocal activity are routed, would open new
   avenues of sociological exploration. Thirdly, including translocal
   activities connected with distributions of ethnic migrant bodies, such
   as capital transfers, would broaden its focus, taking migration and
   ethnicity more centrally into the analysis of globalization as one of
   its constituting practices. Finally, paying attention to sending, as
   well as arrival cities, reveals migrants' thinking and shapes the ways
   in which they live, as my data shows. The Chinese are both one of the
   UK's neglected minorities, and one of its fastest growing populations.
   They are a good example of new UK migrants and they bring
   globalization's realignment with the rising significance of China to the
   UK.

AB The hidden barriers, or gender pay gap', preventing women from earning
   equivalent incomes to men is well documented. Yet recent research has
   uncovered that, in Britain, there is also a comparable class-origin pay
   gap in higher professional and managerial occupations. So far this
   analysis has only been conducted at the national level and it is not
   known whether there are regional differences within the UK. This paper
   uses pooled data from the 2014 and 2015 Labour Force Survey (N=7,534) to
   stage a more spatially sensitive analysis that examines regional
   variation in the class pay gap. We find that this class ceiling' is not
   evenly spatially distributed. Instead it is particularly marked in
   Central London, where those in high-status occupations who are from
   working-class backgrounds earn, on average, 10,660 pound less per year
   than those whose parents were in higher professional and managerial
   employment. Finally, we inspect the Capital further to reveal that the
   class pay gap is largest within Central London's banking and finance
   sector. Challenging policy conceptions of London as the engine room' of
   social mobility, these findings suggest that class disadvantage within
   high-status occupations is particularly acute in the Capital. The
   findings also underline the value of investigating regional differences
   in social mobility, and demonstrate how such analysis can unravel
   important and previously unrecognized spatial dimensions of class
   inequality.

AB In a previous paper it has been shown that across three cohorts of men
   and women born in Britain in 1946, 1958 and 1970 a gender difference
   exists in regard to relative rates of class mobility. For men these
   rates display an essential stability but for women they become more
   equal. The aim of the present paper is to shed light on the causes of
   this trendor, that is, of increasing social fluidityamong women. We
   begin by considering a refined version of the perverse fluidity
   hypothesis: that is, one that proposes that part-time work leads to
   increasing downward worklife mobility among women that also entails
   downward intergenerational mobility and thus promotes greater fluidity.
   We do in fact find that the increase in fluidity is very largely, if not
   entirely, confined to women who have had at least one period of
   part-time work. However, a more direct test of the hypothesis is not
   supportive. We are then led to investigate whether it is not that
   part-time working itself is the crucial factor but rather that women who
   subsequently work part-time already differ from those who do not at
   entry into employment. We find that eventual full- and part-timers do
   not differ in their class origins nor, in any systematic way, in their
   educational qualifications. But there is a marked and increasing
   difference in the levels of employment at which they make their labour
   market entry. Eventual part-timers are more likely than eventual
   full-timers to enter in working-class positions, regardless of their
   class origins and qualifications. Insofar as these women are from more
   advantaged origins, they would appear not to seek to exploit their
   advantages to the same extent as do full-timers in order to advance
   their own work careers. And it is, then, in the downward mobility
   accepted by these womenwho increase in number across the cohortsthat we
   would locate the main source of the weakening association between class
   origins and destinations that is revealed among women at large.

AB We investigate the relationship between social origin, postgraduate
   degree attainment, and occupational outcomes across five British
   age-group cohorts. We use recently-available UK Labour Force Survey data
   to conduct a series of logistic regressions of postgraduate (masters or
   doctorate) degree attainment among those with first degrees, with
   controls for measures of degree classification, degree subject, age,
   gender, ethnicity and national origin. We find a marked strengthening of
   the effect of class origin on degree- and occupational attainment across
   age cohorts. While for older generations there is little or no
   difference by class origin in the rates at which first-degree graduates
   attain postgraduate degrees, those with working-class-origins in the
   youngest age-group are only about 28 per cent as likely to obtain a
   postgraduate degree when compared with their peers from privileged
   origins. Moreover, social origin matters more for occupational
   destination, even among those with postgraduate degrees, for those in
   younger age groups. These findings demonstrate the newly important, and
   increasing, role of postgraduate degrees in reproducing socio-economic
   inequality in the wake of the substantial expansion of undergraduate and
   postgraduate education. Our findings lend some support to the Maximally
   Maintained Inequality thesis, suggesting that gains in equality of
   access to first-degrees are indeed at risk from postgraduate expansion.

AB The paper looks into the dynamics of information society policy and its
   implementation in the Greek context. It argues that information society
   development is a contested process, influenced by pre-existing state,
   economy and society relations. Based on this, it looks into the
   different aspects of the idiosyncratic path which the evolution of the
   Greek information society has followed, particularly after 2000. Using
   Bob Jessop's strategic-relational approach (SRA) to the state as an
   analytical framework and drawing on a number of in-depth interviews with
   relevant political actors, it provides insights into policy
   implementation by examining: the public management of information
   technology projects, how such projects were received in bureaucratic
   structures and practices, as well as the relationship between the state
   and the information and communication technology (ICT) sector in public
   procurement processes. The emphasis is on the period 2000-2008, during
   which a major operational programme on the information society in Greece
   was put into effect. The paper also touches upon the post-2008
   experience, suggesting that information society developments might
   include dynamics operating independently and even in contradiction to
   the state agenda.

AB Whether employment life courses have become more unstable and complex
   across the twentieth century has been a prominent topic in academic and
   public debate. Yet, empirical evidence on longer-term employment
   trajectories and how they changed across cohorts beyond single-country
   analyses is sparse. In this paper, we propose a new methodological
   approach that includes measures developed in sequence analysis to
   summarize complexity in employment trajectories in a cross-classified
   multilevel model by cohort and country. This allows us to quantify and
   describe change in the complexity of employment trajectories across
   cohorts relative to variation across fourteen European countries. We use
   SHARELIFE data to analyze employment trajectories from age 15 to 45 for
   men and women born between 1918 and 1963. For these birth cohorts,
   findings show that change across cohorts is negligibly small, compared
   with a sizeable variation of complexity in employment trajectories
   across countries. Further, based on theoretical assumptions derived from
   the varieties of capitalism literature, we demonstrate that the
   cross-national variation in employment complexity can, in part, be
   accounted for by employment protection legislation and unemployment
   protection measured as wage replacement rates. We conclude that in
   accordance with other studies, our findings contradict the commonly held
   belief that employment trajectories have become much more unstable
   across the second half of the twentieth century. More generally, the
   proposed methodological approach is also promising to analyze complexity
   in life course trajectories in other areas of application.

AB Why are some workers employed in some workplaces more likely to acquire
   valued rewards in the form of employer-provided benefits? In this paper,
   I shed new light on the sources of benefits inequality by developing a
   structural, rent-based theory as a strategy for observing and explaining
   within-and between-workplace benefits inequality. I put forward rent
   extraction by powerful workers as a main causal mechanism that produces
   within-workplace variation; and workplaces' rent-sharing, attributable
   to firms with considerable resources and formalized organizations, as a
   mechanism that generates between-workplace variation. I test this
   theoretical model and the "linkedness" of the two mechanisms by
   analyzing Israeli matched employer-employee register data. I find that
   workers with greater bargaining power for rent extraction (i.e.,
   full-time full-year (FTFY), service-class occupations) are more likely
   to obtain valued benefits within workplaces. Also large-scale,
   large-size firms and formalized workplaces (i.e., state-owned and public
   organizations and older organizations) are more likely to share their
   rent by providing valued benefits to all their workers, FTFY workers and
   service-class employees in particular. I conclude that benefits
   exacerbate the disparities arising from wages-except for women, who have
   higher odds of obtaining valued benefits than comparable men;
   implicitly, women have an unmeasured preference for benefits.

AB Research shows that receiving loans, family contributions, and grants
   has implications for students both during and after college, but one key
   outcome has been overlooked: fields of study. Using data from the
   National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1997 cohort (NLSY-97), this study
   is the first to assess how college funding is associated with first-term
   majors and course selection throughout college. I posit that funding
   sources effectively constrain students' fields of study, such that
   students choose majors and courses that align with their broader
   financial circumstances. As funding from loans increases, students are
   more likely to major in applied non-STEM fields (e.g., business,
   nursing) and less likely to be undeclared during the first
   term-particularly if students are from low-or middle-income families.
   Conversely, as funding from family contributions increases, students are
   more likely to be undeclared and less likely to major or take courses in
   applied non-STEM fields. Receiving grants bears little relation to
   students' major or course fields. These patterns suggest that funding
   sources entail distinct costs and benefits that may influence college
   student decision-making, and that fields of study are the product of
   multiple sources of inequality.

   to Nordic countries. We compare the association between family income
   and sons' earnings in the United States (National Longitudinal Study of
   Youth 1979), Britain (British Cohort Study 1970), and Sweden (Population
   Register Data, 1965 cohort), and find that both income elasticities and
   rank-order correlations are highest in the United States, followed by
   Britain, with Sweden being clearly more equal. We ask whether
   differences in educational inequality and in return to qualifications
   can explain these cross-country differences. Surprisingly, we find that
   this is not the case, even though returns to education are higher in the
   United States. Instead, the low income mobility in the United States and
   Britain is almost entirely due to the part of the parent-son association
   that is not mediated by educational attainment. In the United States and
   especially Britain, parental income is far more important for earnings
   at a given level of education than in Sweden, a result that holds also
   when controlling for cognitive ability. This goes against widespread
   ideas of the United States as a country where the role of ascription is
   limited and meritocratic stratification prevails.

   patterns and predictors of nationalist emphases in 576 secondary school
   social science textbooks from 78 countries published between 1955 and
   2011. Our descriptive and multilevel analyses show that nationalist
   narratives in textbooks persist into the recent globalization era and on
   average are not diminished in countries that are more economically,
   politically, or socially globalized. However, countries that occupy a
   dominant position in world society-either through Western cultural
   status or deeper embeddedness in international non-governmental
   organizations (INGOs)-tend to display lower levels of nationalism in
   their textbooks. Our examination contributes to the sociology of
   education by highlighting that the relationship between the global and
   the national is not a zero sum game: even in our globalized world,
   nationalist educational narratives are alive and well. We further
   contribute to the world society perspective by highlighting a tension
   between recent world cultural shifts toward individual rights and
   cosmopolitanism and the continued centrality of the nation-state model
   in world society. Our results suggest that attenuation of nationalist
   celebrations in schooling may be easiest for globally dominant countries

AB Despite prominent and compelling theoretical arguments linking
   manufacturing imports from the global South to rising income inequality
   in the global North, the literature has produced decidedly mixed support
   for such arguments. We explain this mixed support by introducing
   intervening processes at the global and national levels. At the global
   level, evolving characteristics of global production networks (GPNs)
   amplify the effect of Southern imports. At the national level, wage
   coordination and welfare state generosity counteract the mechanisms by
   which Southern imports increase inequality, and thereby mitigate their
   effects. We conduct a time-series cross-section regression analyses of
   income inequality among eighteen advanced capitalist countries to test
   these propositions. Our analysis addresses alternative explanations, as
   well as validity threats related to model specification, sample
   composition, and measurement. We find substantial variation in the
   effect of Southern imports across global and national contexts. Southern
   imports have no systematic effect on income inequality until the
   magnitude of GPN activity surpasses its world-historical average, or in
   states with above-average levels of wage coordination and welfare state
   generosity. With counterfactual analyses, we show that Southern imports
   would have led to much different inequality trajectories in the North if
   there were fewer GPNs, and if the prevailing degrees of wage
   coordination and welfare state generosity were higher. The
   countervailing effects of GPNs and institutional context call for
   theories of inequality at the intersection of the global and the
   national, and raise important questions about distributional politics in
   the years to come.

   separate premarital from postmarital earnings movements. The data
   consist of information on annual earnings 1990-2009 for all Swedes born
   1960-1974 (N = 926,219). The results indicate that age homogamy is
   related to higher earnings for both men and women, and that larger age
   differences are generally associated with lower union premiums, quite
   independently of which spouse is older. However, most of these results
   are explained by assortative mating, in which men and women with greater
   earnings potentials find partners of a similar age. Overall, the age
   difference between spouses seems to have a limited causal effect, if
   any, on individual earnings.

   neighborhood crime outcomes. Drawing on routine activities theory and
   social disorganization theory, such research has posited that such
   institutions can directly affect crime rates by providing potential
   targets or encouraging criminal behavior, and can indirectly affect
   crime rates by discouraging social control efforts. We draw on this
   literature, as well as the literature on reactions to firearm
   prevalence, to examine the effects of gun shops on local crime rates.
   Using data for the year 2000 drawn from the National Neighborhood Crime

   crime in eighty-nine large US cities. Our findings indicate that gun
   shop prevalence in urban areas is associated with increased rates of
   homicides and robberies, and that these effects are more pronounced in
   neighborhoods characterized by residential instability. We conclude with
   a discussion of policy considerations and avenues for future research on

AB This study investigates whether exposure to various news sectors (local
   television, network television, cable television, radio, daily print
   newspapers, and Internet) is associated with audience members' criminal
   justice policy preferences, and how these relationships are moderated by
   audience members' socio-demographic characteristics. I propose that the
   relationship between news exposure and punitiveness is mediated by
   audience members' instrumental concerns (fear of crime and previous
   victimization) and expressive concerns (belief in the importance of
   traditional ties, feelings of racial resentment, and pessimism about the
   national economy). I further suggest that the relationship between news
   exposure and punitiveness is moderated by audience members'
   socio-demographic characteristics (race/ethnicity, local crime rate, and
   political ideology). Finally, I contend that individual news sectors
   vary in their attention to crime and their rhetorical framing, and thus
   have differing relationships with punitiveness. Results of a nationally
   representative survey suggest that news exposure cultivates punitiveness
   among whites, but not among blacks or Hispanics. Among whites, local
   news viewership has a significant positive relationship with
   punitiveness, particularly among individuals living in low-crime areas.
   Cable television, radio, print newspaper, and Internet news exposure
   have significant relationships with punitiveness, the direction of which
   hinges on audience members' partisanship. I discuss the results in the
   context of the social construction of reality, highlighting the
   interplay between experienced and vicarious sources of knowledge, and in
   terms of selective exposure, emphasizing that audience members' news
   outlet choices have profound implications for their worldviews.

AB Despite sustained attention, scholars disagree about the relationship
   between country-level affluence and the environmental concern of mass
   publics. While many studies assume this relationship to be uniform, we
   argue that it is reasonable to expect meaningful variation in the
   association between country-level affluence and concern across countries
   with different levels of wealth. We place this idea at the center of our
   analyses. To do so, we assess public willingness to pay for
   environmental protection using five waves of World Values Survey data,
   examining 101 country-years nested in forty-two countries spanning
   nineteen years. Results from mixed-effects logistic and linear
   regression models reveal substantial heterogeneity in the association
   between environmental concern and country-level affluence. We find that
   growth in affluence over time associates with higher mass environmental
   concern, but only among less affluent countries. In contrast, countries
   that are on average more affluent tend to have lower environmental
   concern, but again, this relationship is primarily concentrated among
   less affluent countries. Although a variety of theories can be usefully
   applied to particular relationships occurring along the range of
   affluence, we argue that degradation theories go far in explaining the
   heterogeneous associations uncovered between environmental concern and
   country-level affluence. That associations are largely concentrated
   among less affluent countries has implications for the understanding of
   environmental concern in wealthy countries and the development of policy
   to address environmental reform. These issues are discussed in the
   conclusion.

AB This paper introduces a historical, macro-political argument into the
   literature on anti-immigration sentiment, which has mainly considered
   individual-level predictors such as education or social capital as well
   as country-level factors such as fluctuations in labor market
   conditions, changing composition of immigration streams, or the rise of
   populist parties. We argue that past geopolitical competition and war
   have shaped how national identities formed and thus also contemporary
   attitudes toward newcomers: countries that have experienced more violent
   conflict or lost territory and sovereignty developed ethnic (rather than
   civic) forms of nationalism and thus show higher levels of
   anti-immigration sentiment today. We introduce a geopolitical threat
   scale and score 33 European countries based on their historical
   experiences. Two anti-immigration measures come from the European Social
   Survey. Mixed-effects, ordinal logistic regression models reveal strong
   statistical and substantive significance for the geopolitical threat
   scale. Furthermore, ethnic forms of national identification do seem to
   mediate this relationship between geopolitical threat and restrictionist
   attitudes. The main analysis is robust to a wide variety of model
   specifications, to the inclusion of all control variables known to
   affect anti-immigration attitudes, and to a series of alternative
   codings of the geopolitical threat scale.

AB Using longitudinal data that we have collected on friendship and advice
   relations in a cohort of MBA students, we examine how status affects the
   dynamics of network ties among peers. Estimates of Stochastic
   Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs) suggest that status is a consequence of
   network ties because over time the level of status attributed to
   individual students by other students tends to the average level of
   status attributed to their network partners-a phenomenon we call status
   assimilation. Status is also an antecedent to network ties because it
   affects partner selection decisions, giving rise to distinct forms of
   social attachment. We find that both network-based processes of status
   assimilation, as well as status-based processes of social selection, are
   present, but they vary subtly yet significantly across network domains.
   Students tend to the average level of status of their friends, but not
   to that of their advisors. High-status students are more active in the
   friendship network, but more popular in the advice network. We find
   evidence of performance homophily rather than status homophily: students
   with similar grades are more likely to exchange friendship and advice
   ties. High-status students tend to be more central in the advice
   network, but status attributions spill over through friendship, rather
   than advice relations. The study documents how the relation between
   social status and social networks varies both over time, as well as
   across network domains. The study also demonstrates the importance of
   accounting for multiplexity-the tendency of a network to operate through
   another.

AB How is the delinquent behavior of adolescents influenced by their peers?
   Previous studies in criminology have primarily focused on the effects of
   friendship networks on delinquency, but what is less examined is the
   influence of weaker and often negligible relationships on behavior. In
   this paper, we explore the effect of familiar others, namely those
   socio-demographically similar peers who are not connected through
   friendships, on the behavioral diffusion of smoking among adolescents.
   Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
   Health, we show that, even after controlling for the behavior of
   friends, the smoking behavior of familiar others has a significant
   longitudinal effect on adolescents' likelihood of smoking tobacco and
   marijuana. The results have important implications for expanding our
   understanding of the social diffusion of adolescent behavior through
   contextual mechanisms.

AB Genre assignments help audiences make sense of new releases. Studies
   from a wide range of market contexts have shown that generalists defying
   clear mapping to established categories suffer penalties in market
   legitimacy, perceived quality, or audience attention. We introduce an
   empirical strategy to disentangle two mechanisms, reduced niche fitness
   and audience confusion, causing devaluation or ignorance of
   boundary-crossing offers. Our data on 2,971 feature films released to US
   theaters and subsequently made available on DVD further reveal that
   consequences of category spanning are subject to strong moderating
   influences. Negative effects are far from universal, manifesting only if
   (a) combined genres are culturally distant, (b) products are released to
   a stable and highly institutionalized market context, and (c) offers
   lack familiarity as an alternative source of market recognition. Our
   study provides ramifications as to the scope conditions of
   categorization effects and modifies some widely acknowledged truisms
   regarding boundary crossing in cultural markets.

AB Research on inmate social order, a once-vibrant area, receded just as
   U.S. incarceration rates climbed and the country's carceral contexts
   dramatically changed. This study returns to inmate society with an
   abductive mixed-methods investigation of informal status within a
   contemporary men's prison unit. We collected narrative and social
   network data from 133 male inmates housed in a unit of a Pennsylvania
   medium-security prison. Analyses of inmate narratives suggest that unit
   "old heads" provide collective goods in the form of mentoring and role
   modeling that foster a positive and stable peer environment. We test
   this hypothesis with Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) of peer
   nomination data. The ERGM results complement the qualitative analysis
   and suggest that older inmates and inmates who have been on the unit
   longer are perceived by their peers as powerful and influential. Both
   analytic strategies point to the maturity of aging and the acquisition
   of local knowledge as important for attaining informal status in the
   unit. In summary, this mixed-methods case study extends theoretical
   insights of classic prison ethnographies, adds quantifiable results
   capable of future replication, and points to a growing population of
   older inmates as important for contemporary prison social organization.

AB To reduce poverty and food insecurity in Africa requires raising
   productivity in agriculture. Systematic use of fertilizer and hybrid
   seed is a pathway to increased productivity, but adoption of these
   technologies remains low. We investigate whether the quality of
   agricultural inputs can help explain low take-up. Testing modern
   products purchased in local markets, we find that 30% of nutrient is
   missing in fertilizer, and hybrid maize seed is estimated to contain
   less than 50% authentic seeds. We document that such low quality results
   in low average returns. If authentic technologies replaced these
   low-quality products, however, average returns are high. To rationalize
   the findings, we calibrate a learning model using data from our
   agricultural trials. Because agricultural yields are noisy, farmers'
   ability to learn about quality is limited and this can help explain the
   low quality equilibrium we observe, but also why the market has not
   fully collapsed.

AB This article studies technology adoption in a cluster of soccer-ball
   producers in Sialkot, Pakistan. We invented a new cutting technology
   that reduces waste of the primary raw material and gave the technology
   to a random subset of producers. Despite the clear net benefits for
   nearly all firms, after 15 months take-up remained puzzlingly low. We
   hypothesize that an important reason for the lack of adoption is a
   misalignment of incentives within firms: the key employees (cutters and
   printers) are typically paid piece rates, with no incentive to reduce
   waste, and the new technology slows them down, at least initially.
   Fearing reductions in their effective wage, employees resist adoption in
   various ways, including by misinforming owners about the value of the
   technology. To investigate this hypothesis, we implemented a second
   experiment among the firms that originally received the technology: we
   offered one cutter and one printer per firm a lump-sum payment,
   approximately a month's earnings, conditional on demonstrating
   competence in using the technology in the presence of the owner. This
   incentive payment, small from the point of view of the firm, had a
   significant positive effect on adoption. The results suggest that
   misalignment of incentives within firms is an important barrier to
   technology adoption in our setting.

AB There are a large number of studies which show social class
   differentials in educational test scores and results from an early age.
   Cultural explanations based on working-class 'resistance' to learning
   activities or class differences in 'cultural capital' are often put
   forward to explain differentials in educational test scores. In this
   article we first discuss why these processes cannot account for the
   pattern of class differences, given the empirical patterns observed
   before setting out and then testing two alternative theories that
   purport to explain class differences in educational performance: the
   family investment model (FIM) and the family stress model (FSM).
   Empirical expectations from these theories are defined and then tested
   using data from four waves of the Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally
   representative sample of children from the United Kingdom. Structural
   equation models with mediation are used to quantify the direct and
   indirect effects of social class acting via cognitive ability and child
   psychological adjustment. Our models account for between 81 and 93 per
   cent of the effect of social class on teacher assessments of child
   educational performance. Approximately two-thirds of the effect of
   social class on educational performance at age 7 years are mediated by
   differential child cognitive ability and 15 per cent by psychological
   adjustment. The mechanisms in the FIM and FSM models strongly interact
   suggesting that a hybrid model may be more useful. Processes central to
   the FSM but acting through the child's cognitive ability are key in
   determining educational differentials across social class groups.

AB In this article, we investigate the effect of social customs on one of
   the most important instances of collective action, namely, workers
   uniting in trade unions. Although many studies have used social custom
   theory to explain unionization, existing studies have not adequately
   analysed social customs at the workplace. Using workplace union density
   as a proxy for social custom, this analysis improves existing studies in
   a number of ways. First, multi-level analyses of a large panel data set
   from Denmark reveal that there is a significant positive effect of
   workplace union density on the probability that new employees join
   unions. Secondly, using nonparametric regression, we find that the
   functional form of the relationship between the two variables is
   accelerating. These results hold for various subsamples. The
   accelerating functional form indicates that large initial investments in
   unionization are required to create self-sustaining social customs for
   union membership. Thirdly, we test the acceleration using segmented
   regression analysis and find a significant acceleration around 45-65 per
   cent workplace union density. In the conclusion, we discuss the
   implications of our study for unionization strategies and for research
   on unionization.

AB This research presents a new perspective on migrant integration. It
   questions the extent that established migrants perceive threats from new
   migrants, and how that is influenced by natives' perceived migrant
   threat. We hypothesized about an acculturation pattern that established
   migrants will be more similar to the host country's dominant public
   opinion in their migrant threat perceptions than more recent migrants.
   Furthermore, we examined to what extent ethnic competition theory also
   applies to migrants. We analysed migrants in the data from the European
   Social Survey. As expected, established migrants perceive less of a
   threat from new migrants than natives. Public opinion among natives was
   positively associated with established migrants' threat perceptions and
   in particular with threat perceptions of migrants who had resided longer
   in the destination country and were better structurally integrated.
   Moreover, among migrants, threat perceptions are lower in particular in
   contexts where the share of new migrants with a similar cultural
   background is higher. Finally, hypotheses derived from ethnic
   competition theory that have found support among natives were also
   supported among migrants: The lower the educational level and
   socio-economic status of established migrants, the stronger their
   migrant threat perceptions.

   conditions. A statistical decomposition approach is developed and
   applied, allowing for a systematic differentiation between long-term
   change, short-term fluctuations, and structural regional differences in
   labour-market conditions. To study individual-level consequences for
   transitions to vocational training, regionalized labour-market data are
   merged with longitudinal data from the National Educational Panel Study,
   and multivariate transition-rate models are fitted. The results indicate
   that structural differences between regions have had significant effects
   on the transition behaviour of school leavers, whereas temporary crises
   have been of only minor relevance. Moreover, different groups have been
   affected to different degrees by varying labour-market conditions. We
   also highlight the usefulness of our decomposition approach for a
   broader set of applications.

   investigates the influence of parental separation on father and mother
   involvement in their children's lives in adolescence using data from the
   German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) and employing family
   fixed-effects models to control for omitted variable bias. The results
   show that parental separation negatively affects father involvement.
   Father involvement, however, is only reduced as a result of separation
   in socio-economically disadvantaged families. In addition, father
   involvement is more reduced for girls than for boys. Mother involvement
   is not influenced by parental separation. Taken together, these results
   demonstrate that changes in parental involvement following parental
   separation show an important amount of heterogeneity.

AB Immigrants and ethnic minority members typically hold lower levels of
   social trust than majority members due to fewer socio-economic resources
   and a higher risk of discrimination. While institutional factors are a
   strong predictor for different levels of social trust across countries,
   we know little about whether and how institutional and political
   contexts influence group-related differences in trust within societies.
   This study examines how institutional fairness and anti-discrimination
   policies influence social trust gaps between natives and immigrants as
   well as ethnic minority members. Offering a nuanced perspective, I argue
   that regulations promoting equal treatment may also have unintended
   consequences on ethnic minority trust by increasing the sensitivity
   towards remaining inequalities and discriminatory practices. Multilevel
   models test the theoretical arguments using repeated cross-sectional
   survey data from European countries merged with time series information
   on political context. The results show that an increase in institutional
   fairness is related to widening social trust gaps. Findings from
   additional tests on potential mechanisms suggest that institutional
   fairness promotes norms of equal treatment which in turn magnify the
   extent to which ethnic discrimination impedes social trust.

AB Many scholars see social mobility as a key factor that contributes to

   versions of the social mobility argument and assess their empirical
   validity using recent survey data on music and visual arts consumption
   in the United Kingdom. By applying diagonal reference models to our
   data, we show that none of these three arguments receives empirical
   support. Both parents' and respondent's educational level affect
   music/visual arts consumption, with the weight of the former being about
   a third in magnitude of the latter. There is no difference between the
   upwardly mobile and the downwardly mobile in the relative weights of
   origin and destination. Finally, socially mobile individuals are
   actually less omnivorous than those who are intergenerationally stable
   in advantaged positions. In light of these findings, we argue that
   social mobility does not explain the emergence of music/visual arts
   omnivores in the United Kingdom.

AB We examine the extent to which the educational attainments of a
   generation are reproduced in Great Britain. We address a very specific
   question-what was the effect, among people born around the middle of the
   20th century, of having acquired a University degree on the probability
   of having a child who also acquires a degree? We consider the two
   central processes involved: the effect of having a degree on whether a
   person had a child and, conditional on having at least one child, the
   effect of having a degree on whether at least one child acquired a
   degree. We find a strong and persistent negative effect of having a
   degree on the chances of having a child, but, among those who had a
   child, the possession of a degree had a large positive effect on the
   probability of that child also acquiring a degree. These two effects
   largely cancel out, and thus having a degree had a very small effect on
   the chances of having a child who also had a degree. One major advantage
   of adopting the prospective approach used here is that it helps to
   better answer questions concerning the intergenerational effects of
   changes in education.

AB This article presents a theorem connecting the goodness or badness of a
   thing with the goodness or badness of inequality in the thing's
   distribution. The theorem, which applies to cardinally measurable things
   like income, debt, years in prison, disease risk, and risk of
   unemployment, states that if an observer regards the original thing as a
   good (bad), then that observer regards inequality in the thing's
   distribution as a bad (good). The proof uses three inequality measures
   and two fairness measures embedding observer framing of things as good
   or bad. The theorem touches many themes in the sociological literature,
   not only goods and bads, inequality and stratification, the Weberian
   life chances, values, and attitudes toward inequality, but also, via its
   proof, fairness and moral development. Further, the theorem and its
   proof raise questions that provide new directions for theoretical and
   empirical research. For example, empirical tasks ahead include (1)
   learning more about inequality in bads (especially about their frequency
   distributions and inequality measures, to match the growing knowledge
   about differences across subgroups), and (2) studying both just rewards
   and justice evaluations, in both goods and bads, to assess the scope of
   justice concerns between earned and unearned things and between
   additive, transferable possessions and nonadditive, nontransferable
   characteristics. Finally, this work contributes to the growing
   understanding of the connections between inequality, justice, and the
   vast behavioural and social outcomes which inequality and justice,
   separately or together, generate.

AB How do social relationships develop when people fall into poverty or

   regarding poverty and social relationships exists, respective dynamics
   and causality questions remain unanswered. We use longitudinal German
   Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) data from 1992 to 2013 and analyse contact
   frequency, the size of social networks, as well as their composition
   (friends; family members; employed persons). Our results support central
   findings from cross-sectional studies with a longitudinal research
   design: contacts frequencies and the resource potential of a network
   decline; however, contacts to family members and the number of close
   friends remain unaffected. Additionally, we show that poverty negatively
   impacts social relationship patterns with a delay and in a non-linear
   fashion. Pure poverty consequences on social network patterns are rather
   small, but they are nevertheless existent, even when controlling for
   other life events (e.g. illness or unemployment) that are quite strongly
   related to social network issues.

   positive effects of gender and racial diversity on sales revenue, number
   of customers, perceived relative market share, and perceived relative
   profitability. This comment points out that Herring's analysis contains
   two errors. First, missing codes on the outcome variables are treated as
   substantive codes. Second, two control variables-company size and
   establishment size-are highly skewed, and this skew obscures their
   positive associations with the predictor and outcome variables. We
   replicate Herring's analysis correcting for both errors. The findings
   support only one of the original eight hypotheses, suggesting that
   diversity is nonconsequential, rather than beneficial, to business
   success.

AB Understanding the processes that lead to change in institutions and
   meanings is a central concern of sociology. This paper examines the
   tactics used by "plural-marriage" activists to cast members of such
   marriages as an oppressed minority and portray polygamy as empowering to
   women. In-depth interviews with Mormon fundamentalist polygamist women
   (N = 30) and men (N = 4) involved in the plural-marriage-rights movement
   suggest that, to achieve these goals, our respondents distance
   themselves from Mormon fundamentalist groups known to force underage
   girls into marriage while rhetorically likening themselves to a
   population with whom they have moral objections: gays and lesbians.
   Movement leaders reinforce the analogy with gay men and lesbians by
   strategically and self-consciously employing a language of "coming out
   of the closet" to talk about revealing and affirming their polygamist
   status. We argue that they are drawn to this particular language not
   merely because it is culturally ubiquitous but also because of how
   same-sex marriage and polygamy have been connected via what we call
   discursive networks. As feminist scholars, we consider our respondents'
   claims that polygyny offers women advantages over monogamy, while also
   examining how post-feminist discourse about choice can reinforce
   patriarchal structures.

AB Ambitions that students and their parents set during their adolescence
   have significance across the life course. It is yet unclear, however,
   how these expectations respond to changing family circumstances. In this
   work, we examine how negative family economic shocks affect educational
   expectations for students and their parents by using two theoretical
   perspectives - status attainment and adopt-adapt models. Further, we
   move beyond these debates about the malleability of expectations by
   considering how this malleability might differ by your place in the
   social structure. We thus make hypotheses about how social class may
   buffer or amplify the effect of negative family economic shocks on
   educational expectations. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we
   expand our conceptualization of educational expectations beyond degree
   expectations to include educational institutional route expectations-the
   educational pathway that students plan to take to achieve their degree
   expectations. We find that degree expectations are only somewhat
   malleable, but that route expectations are malleable. Family economic
   shocks served to reduce students' and parents' expectations for
   beginning their post-secondary education at a B.A.-granting institution.
   Further, we find support for the amplification hypothesis rather than
   the buffering hypothesis; the expectations of middle-class students and
   parents prove more negatively responsive to family economic shocks than
   do those of their lower SES counterparts. This work has implications for
   examining the dynamic nature of the status attainment process and
   suggests that expanding educational expectations to include
   institutional route may be vital for understanding social mobility in
   the current educational climate.

AB Taking a "strength approach" to African American families and cultures,
   recent research demonstrates that familial racial socialization provides

   discrimination among Black youth. Building on these nascent findings,
   the present study takes a process-oriented approach to understand how
   racial socialization reduces and counteracts the effects of
   discrimination on offending. Building on a social schematic theory of
   offending (Burt and Simons 2011), this study explores whether two social
   psychological factors, positive racial identities and spirituality,
   serve as mechanisms through which racial socialization provides
   resilience. We test our hypotheses with structural equation models using
   data from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), a longitudinal,
   multisite study of roughly 700 African American youth and their primary
   caregivers followed from late childhood to early adulthood. Consistent
   with our theoretical model, findings suggest that familial racial
   socialization practices provide resilience to the criminogenic effects
   of racial discrimination in large part by increasing positive racial
   identities and spirituality. Implications of these findings and
   directions for future research are discussed.

AB The nature of the relationship between employers and employees has been
   changing over the past three decades, with firms increasingly relying on
   contractors, temp agencies, and franchises rather than hiring employees
   directly. We investigate the impact of this transformation on the wage
   structure by following jobs that are moved outside the boundary of lead
   employers to contracting firms. We develop a new method for identifying
   outsourcing of food, cleaning, security, and logistics services in
   administrative data using the universe of social security records in
   Germany. We document a dramatic growth of domestic outsourcing in
   Germany since the early 1990s. Event-study analyses show that wages in
   outsourced jobs fall by approximately 10-15% relative to similar jobs
   that are not outsourced. We find evidence that the wage losses
   associated with outsourcing stem from a loss of firm-specific rents,
   suggesting that labor cost savings are an important reason firms choose
   to contract out these services. Finally, we tie the increase in
   outsourcing activity to broader changes in the German wage structure, in
   particular showing that outsourcing of cleaning, security, and logistics
   services alone accounts for around 9% of the increase in German wage
   inequality since the 1980s.

AB We examine the health plan choices that 23,894 employees at a U.S. firm
   made from a large menu of options that differed only in financial
   cost-sharing and premium. These decisions provide a clear test of the
   predictions of the standard economic model of insurance choice in the
   absence of choice frictions because plans were priced so that nearly
   every plan with a lower deductible was financially dominated by an
   otherwise identical plan with a high deductible. We document that the
   majority of employees chose dominated plans, which resulted in excess
   spending equivalent to 24% of chosen plan premiums. Low-income employees
   were significantly more likely to choose dominated plans, and most
   employees did not switch into more financially efficient plans in the
   subsequent year. We show that the choice of dominated plans cannot be
   rationalized by standard risk preference or any expectations about
   health risk. Testing alternative explanations with a series of
   hypothetical-choice experiments, we find that the popularity of
   dominated plans was not primarily driven by the size and complexity of
   the plan menu, nor informed preferences for avoiding high deductibles,
   but by employees' lack of understanding of health insurance. Our
   findings challenge the standard practice of inferring risk preferences
   from insurance choices and raise doubts about the welfare benefits of
   health reforms that expand consumer choice.

AB Parents play important roles in their children's lives, and parental
   involvement in elementary school in particular is meaningful for a range
   of child outcomes. Given the increasing number of school-aged children
   with incarcerated parents, this study explores the ways paternal
   incarceration is associated with mothers' and fathers' reports of
   home-and school-based involvement in schooling. Using Fragile Families
   Study data, we find that a father's incarceration inhibits his
   school-and home-based involvement in schooling, but associations for
   maternal involvement are weaker. Results are robust to alternative
   specifications of incarceration that address concerns about selection
   and unobserved heterogeneity. Findings also hold across levels of
   father-child contact. We also conducted a test of the system avoidance
   mechanism and results suggest it partially explains reductions in school
   involvement for fathers following incarceration. Given the reoccurring
   interest in the interconnection between families and schools and how
   this translates into success, this study suggests that paternal
   incarceration is associated with lower parental involvement in schooling
   and highlights the role of system avoidance in this association.
   Attachment to social institutions like schools is quite consequential,
   and this work highlights another way mass incarceration influences
   social life in the United States.

AB A growing literature documents deleterious consequences of incarceration
   for mental health. Although salient, incarceration is only one form of
   criminal justice contact and, accordingly, focusing on incarceration may
   mask the extent to which the criminal justice system influences mental
   health. Using insights from the stress process paradigm, along with
   nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Survey of
   Youth 1997, we examine criminal justice contact-defined as arrest,
   conviction, and incarceration-and mental health. First, fixed-effects
   models, which adjust for stable unobserved and time-varying observed
   characteristics, show that arrest is deleteriously associated with
   mental health, and arrest accounts for nearly half of the association
   between incarceration and poor mental health, although certain types of
   incarceration appear more consequential than others. Second, the
   associations are similar across race and ethnicity; this, combined with
   racial/ethnic disparities in contact, indicates that criminal justice
   interactions exacerbate minority health inequalities. Third, the
   associations between criminal justice contact, especially arrest and
   incarceration, and mental health are particularly large among
   respondents residing in contextually disadvantaged areas during
   adolescence. Taken together, the results suggest that the consequences
   of criminal justice contact for mental health have a far greater reach
   than previously considered.

AB Mothers are shown to receive lower wages than childless women across
   industrial countries. Although research on mothers' wage disadvantage
   has noted that the extent of this disadvantage is not universal among
   mothers, it has paid relatively little attention to how the structural
   characteristics of jobs moderate the price women pay for motherhood.
   Using data from 16 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
   that began in 1997, we examine how the pay gap between mothers and
   non-mothers varies by occupational characteristics. Deriving hypotheses
   from three prominent explanations for the motherhood wage
   penalty-stressing work-family conflict and job performance, compensating
   differentials, and employer discrimination, respectively-we test whether
   this penalty changes with an occupation's exposure to hazardous
   conditions, schedule regularity, required on-the-job training,
   competitiveness, level of autonomy, and emphasis on teamwork. Results
   from fixed-effects models show that the wage reduction for each child is
   less in occupations with greater autonomy and lower teamwork
   requirements. Moreover, mothers encounter a smaller penalty when their
   occupations impose less competitive pressure. On the whole, these
   findings are consistent with the model focusing on job strain and
   work-family conflict, adding evidence to the importance of improving job
   conditions to alleviate work-family conflict.

AB Context effects, where a characteristic of an upper-level unit or
   cluster (e.g., a country) affects outcomes and relationships at a lower
   level (e.g., that of the individual), are a primary object of
   sociological inquiry. In recent years, sociologists have increasingly
   analyzed such effects using quantitative multilevel modeling. Our review
   of multilevel studies in leading sociology journals shows that most
   assume the effects of lower-level control variables to be invariant
   across clusters, an assumption that is often implausible. Comparing
   mixed-effects (random-intercept and slope) models, cluster-robust pooled
   OLS, and two-step approaches, we find that erroneously assuming
   invariant coefficients reduces the precision of estimated context
   effects. Semi-formal reasoning and Monte Carlo simulations indicate that
   loss of precision is largest when there is pronounced cross-cluster
   heterogeneity in the magnitude of coefficients, when there are marked
   compositional differences among clusters, and when the number of
   clusters is small. Although these findings suggest that practitioners
   should fit more flexible models, illustrative analyses of European
   Social Survey data indicate that maximally flexible mixed-effects models
   do not perform well in real-life settings. We discuss the need to
   balance parsimony and flexibility, and we demonstrate the encouraging
   performance of one prominent approach for reducing model complexity.

AB We develop and test the idea that public appreciation for authentic
   lowbrow culture affords an effective way for certain elites to address
   feelings of authenticity-insecurity arising from "high status
   denigration" (Hahl and Zuckerman 2014). This argument, which builds on
   recent sociological research on the "search for authenticity" (e.g.,
   Grazian 2005) and on Bourdieu's (1993) notion of artistic
   "disinterestedness," is validated through experiments with U.S. subjects
   in the context of "outsider" art (Fine 2004). The first study
   demonstrates that preference for lowbrow culture perceived to be
   authentic is higher when individuals feel insecure in their authenticity
   because they attained status in a context where extrinsic incentives are
   salient. The second study demonstrates that audiences perceive the
   members of erstwhile denigrated high-status categories to be more
   authentic if they consume lowbrow culture, but only if the cultural
   producer is perceived as authentic. We conclude by noting how this "
   authenticity-by-appreciation" effect might be complementary to
   distinction-seeking as a motivation for elite cultural omnivorousness,
   and we draw broader implications for when and why particular forms of
   culture are in demand.

AB Affluent Americans support more conservative economic policies than the

   Yet little is known about the emergence of these consequential views. We
   develop, test, and find support for a theory of class cultural norms:
   These preferences are partly traceable to socialization that occurs on
   predominantly affluent college campuses, especially those with norms of
   financial gain, and especially among socially embedded students. The
   economic views of the student's cohort also matter, in part
   independently of affluence. We use a large panel data set with a high
   response rate and more rigorous causal inference strategies than
   previous socialization studies. The affluent campus effect holds with
   matching, among students with limited school choice, and in a natural
   experiment; and it passes placebo tests. College socialization partly
   explains why affluent Americans support economically conservative
   policies.

AB Influential recent scholarship assumes that authoritarian rulers act as
   perfect agents of economic elites, foreclosing the possibility that
   economic elites may at times prefer democracy absent a popular threat
   from below. Motivated by a puzzling set of democratic transitions, we
   relax this assumption and examine how elite uncertainty about
   dictatorshipa novel and generalizable causal mechanism impacting
   democratizationcan induce elite support for democracy. We construct a
   noisy signaling model in which a potential autocrat attempts to convince
   economic elites that he will be a faithful partner should elites install
   him in power. The model generates clear predictions about how two major
   types of elite uncertaintyuncertainty in a potential autocratic
   successor's policies produced by variance in the pool of would-be
   dictator types, and uncertainty in the truthfulness of policy promises
   made by potential autocratic successorsimpact the likelihood of
   elite-driven democratization. We demonstrate the model's plausibility in
   a series of cases of democratic transition.

AB This study provides one of the first causal estimates of both the
   personal and partisan incumbency advantages. Using data on six local
   elections taking place during the last 20 years in 278 municipalities in
   Portugal, it relies on a reform introducing mayoral term limits as a
   natural experiment that creates exogenous variation on the incumbency
   status of officeholders while holding the incumbency status of the party
   constant. A new methodology combining two quasi-experimental methods,
   the regression discontinuity and the difference-in-discontinuities
   designs, allows for a credible estimation of the independent personal
   and partisan returns to incumbency. Results causally identify the
   personal effect as the driver of the incumbency advantage.

AB The study of political conflict in legislatures is fundamental to
   understanding the nature of governance, but also difficult because of
   changes in membership and the issues addressed over time. Focusing on
   the enduring issue of civil rights in the United States since
   Reconstruction, we show that using current methods and measures to
   characterize elite ideological disagreements makes it hard to interpret
   or reconcile the conflicts with historical understandings because of
   their failure to adequately account for the policies being voted upon
   and the consequences of the iterative lawmaking process. Incorporating
   information about the policies being voted upon provides a starkly
   different portrait of elite conflictnot only are contemporary parties
   relatively less divided than is commonly thought, but the conflict
   occurs in a smaller, and more liberal, portion of the policy space.
   These findings have important implications for a broad range of work
   that uses elite actions to compare political conflict/polarization
   across time.

AB Despite declining memberships, labor unions still represent large shares
   of electorates worldwide. Yet their political clout remains contested.
   To what extent, and in what way, do unions shape workers' political
   preferences? We address these questions by combining unique survey data
   of American workers and a set of inferential strategies that exploit two
   sources of variation: the legal choice that workers face in joining or
   opting out of unions and the over-time reversal of a union's policy
   position. Focusing on the issue of trade, we offer evidence that unions
   influence their members' policy preferences in a significant and
   theoretically predictable manner. In contrast, we find that
   self-selection into membership accounts at most for a quarter of the
   observed union effect. The study illuminates the impact of unions in
   cohering workers' voice and provides insight on the role of information
   provision in shaping how citizens form policy preferences.

AB The widespread availability of voter files has improved the study of
   participation in American politics, but the lack of comprehensive data
   on nonregistrants creates difficult inferential issues. Most notably,
   observational studies that examine turnout rates among registrants often
   implicitly condition on registration, a posttreatment variable that can
   induce bias if the treatment of interest also affects the likelihood of
   registration. We introduce a sensitivity analysis to assess the
   potential bias induced by this problem, which we call differential
   registration bias. Our approach is most helpful for studies that
   estimate turnout among registrants using posttreatment registration
   data, but it is also valuable for studies that estimate turnout among
   the voting-eligible population using secondary sources. We illustrate
   our approach with two studies of voting eligibility effects on
   subsequent turnout among young voters. In both cases, eligibility
   appears to decrease turnout, but these effects are found to be highly
   sensitive to differential registration bias.

AB We use variation in historical state centralization to examine the
   long-term impact of institutions on cultural norms. The Kuba Kingdom,
   established in Central Africa in the early 17th century by King Shyaam,
   had more developed state institutions than the other independent
   villages and chieftaincies in the region. It had an unwritten
   constitution, separation of political powers, a judicial system with
   courts and juries, a police force, a military, taxation, and significant
   public goods provision. Comparing individuals from the Kuba Kingdom to
   those from just outside the Kingdom, we find that centralized formal
   institutions are associated with weaker norms of rule following and a
   greater propensity to cheat for material gain. This finding is
   consistent with recent models where endogenous investments to inculcate
   values in children decline when there is an increase in the
   effectiveness of formal institutions that enforce socially desirable
   behavior. Consistent with such a mechanism, we find that Kuba parents
   believe it is less important to teach children values related to
   rule-following behaviors.

   Religious elites (Brahmins) burnt disproportionately more widows, and

   campaigns may irrationally fear close contests or be unrealistically

   optimistic than fearful, and that incumbent and higher-office campaigns
   are more accurate at assessing their chances. While the public may be

   face a dilemma: they need effective brokers, but these brokers create
   vulnerabilities that can ultimately reduce the party's vote share and
   even cause electoral loss. So, in addition to highlighting electoral
   strengths of political machines, this article reveals their

   Evidence from the United States and Britain indicate that partisan

   control contributed to enhancing party cohesion during the nineteenth
   and twentieth centuries. Here, these mechanisms are evaluated by
   analysing a dataset containing all the recorded votes from the Canadian
   House of Commons, 1867-2011. Overall, we find that partisan sorting and
   the government's ability to control the agenda are central to the
   consolidation of parties over time. Our results underscore the need to
   integrate institutional rules and legislative agendas into models of
   parliamentary voting behaviour and suggest that strict party discipline
   can lead to the development of a multi-party system in the legislative

   vote choice models assume that parties perfectly transmit positions,

   this news coverage can be biased in terms of salience - which leads to
   asymmetric information. This study examines how information asymmetries
   in news coverage of parties influence knowledge about political party
   positions. It finds that the availability of information in the news
   media about a party increases knowledge about its position, and that

   acquisition and processing have important implications for how election

   identifies cohorts that experienced a shock in family income in

   childhood to be isolated from other characteristics of parents, such as
   their education level and personality traits. The study uses a
   differences-in-differences approach and finds that the affected cohorts

   data in Indonesia from 1990 through 2005, this article argues that riots
   tend to occur in ethnically divided districts with low electoral
   competition because uncompetitiveness in the first democratic elections
   signals continued regime entrenchment and local political exclusion. As
   such, riots often follow uncompetitive elections, and dissipate after

AB The First World War is often cited as proof par excellence of the flaws
   in the liberal peace argument because the adversaries it engaged had
   been each other's major pre-war trading partners. Although commonly
   assumed to have wreaked havoc on the trade of the states it engaged, the
   war's impact on commerce has rarely been rigorously examined. Using an
   original dataset, this study shows that the Great War triggered
   substitution processes that reduced its trade-related costs. Although
   recourse to second-best alternatives always induces efficiency losses,
   the costs of adjustment were small relative to the other costs that
   states incurred during the war. The analysis shows that the Great War is
   not the egregious exception to the theory that conventional wisdom has
   long assumed it to be. At the same time, it makes clear that the
   deterrent power of trade varies inversely with belligerents' ability to
   access the markets of alternative trading partners.

   that activism is passed down from one generation to the next: first
   movers often came from families that had been punished for opposing the
   regime in the past. Secondly, repression during the Arab Spring was also
   counterproductive: those connected to first movers via Facebook
   supported renewed prodemocracy protests when informed of the regime's
   use of repression in 2011. A regime that jails and beats political
   dissidents creates incentives for its citizens to oppose it; these
   abuses can come back to haunt the regime long after repression occurs.

AB We extend Ellsberg's two-urn paradox and propose three symmetric forms
   of partial ambiguity by limiting the possible compositions in a deck of
   100 red and black cards in three ways. Interval ambiguity involves a
   symmetric range of 50- n to 50+ n red cards. Complementarily, disjoint
   ambiguity arises from two nonintersecting intervals of 0 to n and 100 -
   n to 100 red cards. Two-point ambiguity involves n or 100 - n red cards.
   We investigate experimentally attitudes towards partial ambiguity and
   the corresponding compound lotteries in which the possible compositions
   are drawn with equal objective probabilities. This yields three key
   findings: distinct attitudes towards the three forms of partial
   ambiguity, significant association across attitudes towards partial

AB I introduce a model of undirected dyadic link formation which allows for
   assortative matching on observed agent characteristics (homophily) as
   well as unrestricted agent-level heterogeneity in link surplus (degree
   heterogeneity). Like in fixed effects panel data analyses, the joint
   distribution of observed and unobserved agent-level characteristics is
   left unrestricted. Two estimators for the (common) homophily parameter,
   beta(0), are developed and their properties studied under an asymptotic
   sequence involving a single network growing large. The first, tetrad
   logit (TL), estimator conditions on a sufficient statistic for the
   degree heterogeneity. The second, joint maximum likelihood (JML),
   estimator treats the degree heterogeneity {A(i0)}(i=1)(N) as additional
   (incidental) parameters to be estimated. The TL estimate is consistent
   under both sparse and dense graph sequences, whereas consistency of the
   JML estimate is shown only under dense graph sequences.

   conditions, we perform an empirical analysis using data on the Second
   Congo War, a conflict that involves many groups in a complex network of
   informal alliances and rivalries. The estimates of the fighting
   externalities are then used to infer the extent to which the conflict
   intensity can be reduced through (i) dismantling specific fighting
   groups involved in the conflict; (ii) weapon embargoes; (iii)

AB Modeling intergenerational altruism is crucial to evaluate the long-term
   consequences of current decisions, and requires a set of principles
   guiding such altruism. We axiomatically develop a theory of pure, direct
   altruism: Altruism is pure if it concerns the total utility (rather than
   the mere consumption utility) of future generations, and direct if it
   directly incorporates the utility of all future generations. Our axioms
   deliver a new class of altruistic, forward-looking preferences, whose
   weight put on the consumption of a future generation generally depends
   on the consumption of other generations. The only preferences lacking
   this dependence correspond to the quasi-hyperbolic discounting model,
   which our theory characterizes. Our approach provides a framework to
   analyze welfare in the presence of altruistic preferences and addresses
   technical challenges stemming from the interdependent nature of such
   preferences.

AB Differences in preferences are important to explain variation in
   individuals' behavior. There is, however, no consensus on how to take
   these differences into account when evaluating policies. While prominent
   in the economic literature, the standard utilitarian criterion is
   controversial. According to some, interpersonal comparability of
   utilities involves value judgments with little objective basis. Others
   argue that social justice is primarily about the distribution of
   commodities assigned to individuals, rather than their subjective
   satisfaction or happiness. In this paper, we propose and axiomatically
   characterize a criterion, named opportunity-equivalent utilitarian, that
   addresses these claims. First, our criterion ranks social alternatives
   on the basis of individuals' ordinal preferences. Second, it compares
   individuals based on the fairness of their assignments.
   Opportunity-equivalent utilitarianism requires society to maximize the
   sum of specific indices of well-being that are cardinal, interpersonally
   comparable, and represent each individual's preferences.

AB The ill-posedness of the nonparametric instrumental variable (NPIV)
   model leads to estimators that may suffer from poor statistical
   performance. In this paper, we explore the possibility of imposing shape
   restrictions to improve the performance of the NPIV estimators. We
   assume that the function to be estimated is monotone and consider a
   sieve estimator that enforces this monotonicity constraint. We define a
   constrained measure of ill-posedness that is relevant for the
   constrained estimator and show that, under a monotone IV assumption and
   certain other mild regularity conditions, this measure is bounded
   uniformly over the dimension of the sieve space. This finding is in
   stark contrast to the well-known result that the unconstrained sieve
   measure of ill-posedness that is relevant for the unconstrained
   estimator grows to infinity with the dimension of the sieve space. Based
   on this result, we derive a novel non-asymptotic error bound for the
   constrained estimator. The bound gives a set of data-generating
   processes for which the monotonicity constraint has a particularly
   strong regularization effect and considerably improves the performance
   of the estimator. The form of the bound implies that the regularization
   effect can be strong even in large samples and even if the function to
   be estimated is steep, particularly so if the NPIV model is severely
   ill-posed. Our simulation study confirms these findings and reveals the
   potential for large performance gains from imposing the monotonicity
   constraint.

AB Many recent papers in political science and economics use rainfall as a
   strategy to facilitate causal inference. Rainfall shocks are as-if
   randomly assigned, but the assignment of rainfall by county is highly
   correlated across space. Since clustered assignment does not occur
   within well-defined boundaries, it is challenging to estimate the
   variance of the effect of rainfall on political outcomes. I propose
   using randomization inference with historical weather patterns from 7 3
   years as potential randomizations. I replicate the influential work on
   rainfall and voter turnout in presidential elections in the United
   States by Gomez, Hansford, and Krause (2 0 0 7) and compare the
   estimated average treatment effect (ATE) to a sampling distribution of
   estimates under the sharp null hypothesis of no effect. The alternate
   randomizations are random draws from national rainfall patterns on
   election andwould-be election days, which preserve the clustering in
   treatment assignment and eliminate the need to simulate weather patterns
   or make assumptions about unit boundaries for clustering. I find that
   the effect of rainfall on turnout is subject to greater sampling
   variability than previously estimated using conventional standard
   errors.

AB Mixed-methods designs, especially those where cases selected for small-N
   analysis (SNA) are nested within a large-N analysis (LNA), have become
   increasingly popular. Yet, since the LNA in this approach assumes that
   units are independently distributed, such designs are unable to account
   for spatial dependence, and dependence becomes a threat to inference,
   rather than an issue for empirical or theoretical investigation. This is
   unfortunate, since research in political science has recently drawn
   attention to diffusion and interconnectedness more broadly. In this
   paper we develop a framework for mixed-methods research with spatially
   dependent data-a framework we label "geo-nested analysis"-where insights
   gleaned at each step of the research process set the agenda for the next
   phase and where case selection for SNA is based on diagnostics of a
   spatial-econometric analysis. We illustrate our framework using data
   from a seminal study of homicides in the United States.

AB Parties and social movements play an important role in many theories of

   underdeveloped as random samples are difficult to conduct among
   political activists. This paper proposes a novel procedure to sample
   different parties over time and space by utilizing the advertising
   option of the social media webpage Facebook. As this method allows for
   quotas and the collection of large samples at relatively low cost, it
   becomes possible to improve the representativeness through
   poststratification and subsample robustness checks. Three examples
   illustrate these advantages of Facebook sampling: First, a Facebook
   sample approximated intraparty decisions and the outcome of a leadership
   contest of the Alternative for Germany. Second, a weighted Facebook
   sample achieved similar estimates as a representative local leader
   survey of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Third, by evaluating
   subgroups of key demographics for parties with unknown population
   parameters, two Facebook samples show that the color-coded conflict in
   Thailand was driven by different concepts of regime type, but not by a
   left-right divide on economic policy-making. Facebook sampling appears
   to be the best and cheapest method to conduct time-series
   cross-sectional studies for political activists.

AB Methodologists and substantive scholars alike agree that one of process
   tracing's foremost contributions to qualitative research is its capacity
   to adjudicate among competing explanations of a phenomenon. Existing
   approaches, however, only provide explicit guidance on dealing with
   mutually exclusive explanations, which are exceedingly rare in social
   science research. I develop a tripartite solution to this problem. The
   Relationships among Rivals (RAR) framework (1) introduces a typology of
   relationships between alternative hypotheses, (2) develops specific
   guidelines for identifying which relationship is present between two
   hypotheses, and (3) maps out the varied implications for evidence
   collection and inference. I then integrate the RAR framework into each
   of the main process-tracing approaches and demonstrate how it affects
   the inferential process. Finally, I illustrate the purchase of the RAR
   framework by reanalyzing a seminal example of process-tracing research:
   Schultz's (2001) analysis of the Fashoda Crisis. I show that the same
   evidence can yield new and sometimes contradictory inferences once
   scholars approach comparative hypothesis testing with this more nuanced

AB Bayesian probability holds the potential to serve as an important bridge
   between qualitative and quantitative methodology. Yet whereas Bayesian
   statistical techniques have been successfully elaborated for
   quantitative research, applying Bayesian probability to qualitative
   research remains an open frontier. This paper advances the burgeoning
   literature on Bayesian process tracing by drawing on expositions of
   Bayesian "probability as extended logic" from the physical sciences,
   where probabilities represent rational degrees of belief in propositions
   given the inevitably limited information we possess. We provide
   step-by-step guidelines for explicit Bayesian process tracing, calling
   attention to technical points that have been overlooked or inadequately
   addressed, and we illustrate how to apply this approach with the first
   systematic application to a case study that draws on multiple pieces of
   detailed evidence. While we caution that efforts to explicitly apply
   Bayesian learning in qualitative social science will inevitably run up
   against the difficulty that probabilities cannot be unambiguously
   specified, we nevertheless envision important roles for explicit
   Bayesian analysis in pinpointing the locus of contention when scholars
   disagree on inferences, and in training intuition to follow Bayesian
   probability more systematically.

   argue here that elite cue-taking models in International Relations are
   both overly pessimistic and unnecessarily restrictive. Members of the
   public may lack information about the world around them, but they do not
   lack principles, and information need not only cascade from the top
   down. We present the results from five survey experiments where we show
   that cues from social peers are at least as strong as those from
   political elites. Our theory and results build on a growing number of
   findings that individuals are embedded in a social context that combines
   with their general orientations toward foreign policy in shaping
   responses toward the world around them. Thus, we suggest the public is
   perhaps better equipped for espousing judgments in foreign affairs than
   many of our top-down models claim.

   agents about the leader's privately held information as her coercive
   capacity increases. By adjusting her policy choice in response to
   available private and public information, the coercive leader achieves
   her preferred average of agents' actions, and in so doing, neutralizes
   the possibly deleterious coordinating influence of public information.
   We develop implications of our analysis for understanding autocratic
   leadership in different political and organizational contexts.

AB Spatial models of policymaking have evolved from the median voter
   theorem to the inclusion of institutional considerations such as
   committees, political parties, and various voting and amendment rules.
   Such models, however, implicitly assume that no policy is better than
   another at solving public policy problems and that all policy makers are
   equally effective at advancing proposals. We relax these assumptions,
   allowing some legislators to be more effective than others at creating
   high-quality proposals. The resulting Legislative Effectiveness Model
   (LEM) offers three main benefits. First, it can better account for
   policy changes based on the quality of the status quo, changing our
   understanding of how to overcome gridlock in polarized legislatures.
   Second, it generalizes canonical models of legislative politics, such as
   median voter, setter, and pivotal politics models, all of which emerge
   as special cases within the LEM. Third, the LEM offers significant new
   empirical predictions, some of which we test (and find support for)
   within the U.S. Congress.

AB Why do organizations choose to use nonviolence? Why do they choose
   specific nonviolent tactics? Existing quantitative work centers on mass
   nonviolent campaign, but much of the nonviolence employed in contentious
   politics is smaller-scale nonviolent direct action. In this article, we
   explore the determinants of nonviolence with new data at the
   organization level in self-determination disputes from 1960 to 2005. We
   present a novel argument about the interdependence of tactical choices
   among nonviolent options in self-determination movements. Given
   limitations on their capabilities, competition among organizations in a
   shared movement, and different resource requirements for nonviolent
   strategies, we show that organizations have incentives to diversify
   tactics rather than just copy other organizations. The empirical
   analysis reveals a rich picture of varied organizational resistance
   choices, and a complex web of interdependence among tactics.

AB Though many scholars study the formation of policy, less attention is
   given to its endurance. In this article, I seek to determine what
   contributes to the longevity of policy by examining the case of
   presidential unilateralism. While scholars widely recognize presidents'
   ability to unilaterally make policy with executive orders, they largely
   do not account for how these same orders can be easily changed by
   subsequent administrations. To address this deficiency, I develop a
   theory of executive order duration based on both time-invariant
   characteristics of the order and time-variant changes in the political
   climate it faces. Using survival analysis to examine all orders revoked
   between 1937 and 2013, I find support for the theory. This study has
   implications for understanding the endurance of executive orders and
   other policy instruments as part of the law as well as understanding the
   strategic actions of policy makers given the transient nature of these
   tools.

AB Does foreign aid improve human rights and democracy? We help arbitrate
   the debate over this question by leveraging a novel source of
   exogeneity: the rotating presidency of the Council of the European
   Union. We find that when a country's former colonizer holds the
   presidency of the Council of the European Union during the budget-making
   process, the country is allocated considerably more foreign aid than are
   countries whose former colonizer does not hold the presidency. Using
   instrumental variables estimation, we demonstrate that this aid has
   positive effects on human rights and democracy, although the effects are
   short-lived after the shock to aid dissipates. We adduce the timing of
   events, qualitative evidence, and theoretical insights to argue that the
   conditionality associated with an increased aid commitment is
   responsible for the positive effects in the domains of human rights and
   democracy.

AB One important and, to date, overlooked component of democratic
   accountability is the extent to which it might exacerbate existing
   societal inequalities if the outcomes for some groups of citizens are
   prioritized over others when voters evaluate governmental performance.
   We analyze a decade of California school board elections and find
   evidence that voters reward or punish incumbent board members based on
   the achievement of white students in their district, whereas outcomes
   for African American and Hispanic students receive comparatively little
   attention. We then examine public opinion data on the racial education
   achievement gap and report results from an original list experiment of
   California school board members that finds approximately 40% of
   incumbents detect no electoral pressure to address poor academic
   outcomes among racial minority students. We conclude by discussing the
   implications of these findings for several scholarly literatures,
   including retrospective voting, racial inequality in political
   influence, intergovernmental policymaking, and education politics.

AB Can the way we speak affect the way we perceive time and think about
   politics? Languages vary by how much they require speakers to
   grammatically encode temporal differences. Futureless tongues (e.g.,
   Estonian) do not oblige speakers to distinguish between the present and
   future tense, whereas futured tongues do (e.g., Russian). By
   grammatically conflating today and tomorrow, we hypothesize that
   speakers of futureless tongues will view the future as temporally closer
   to the present, causing them to discount the future less and support
   future-oriented policies more. Using an original survey experiment that
   randomly assigned the interview language to Estonian/Russian bilinguals,
   we find support for this proposition and document the absence of this
   language effect when a policy has no obvious time referent. We then
   replicate and extend our principal result through a cross-national
   analysis of survey data. Our results imply that language may have
   significant consequences for mass opinion.

AB In recent years, sociologists have noted the increasing centrality of
   credit for determining life chances in our society, but they have not
   given adequate attention to the credit market as a key site where
   individuals assert claims over economic resources. This article explores
   distinctive features of the credit transaction that differentiate claims
   making in the credit market from more familiar forms of claims making in
   the labor market. Rather than the quid pro quo exchange between formal
   equals that characterizes the wage relation, the extension of credit
   creates an obligation that marks the debtor as inferior to the creditor.
   The hierarchical and asymmetrical nature of the loan contract appears to
   erode the possibility for effective political demands in this arena.
   However, this article demonstrates that to the extent the status of
   ownership is institutionalized in the credit transaction, borrowers may
   be able to overcome some of the disadvantages associated with occupying
   the weaker position in an unequal relationship of exchange.

AB Sociologists have frequently noted the relationship between fiscal
   institutions and the development of national financial markets, but the
   centrality of national budgets for structuring that relationship has
   received scant attention. This article uses a historical case study from
   the United States to address that gap. A 1960s political battle between
   the federal government and the Johnson administration over asset sales
   and the budget culminated in a reorganization of U.S. housing finance
   policy: Fannie Mae was spun off and authorized to issue mortgage-backed
   securities. This case study situates the early days of the modern U.S.
   securitization market within a broader political effort to use financial
   engineering and liberalization to avoid the redistribution of wealth,
   revealing how the effort to mobilize capital and influence outside of
   budgetary constraints can organize government engagements with finance.
   Implications are drawn for fiscal sociology, the sociology of finance,
   and the interaction between fiscal and financial systems over time.

AB In 1964-68, the U.S. Congress enacted comprehensive legislation
   prohibiting discrimination in employment (1964 Civil Rights Act), voting
   (1965 Voting Rights Act), and housing (1968 Fair Housing Act). A
   half-century later, most scholars concur that voting rights was by far
   the most successful, fair housing was a general failure, and Title VII
   fell somewhere in between. Explanations of civil rights effectiveness in
   political sociology that emphasize state-internal resources and
   capacities, policy entrepreneurship, and/or the degree of white
   resentment cannot explain this specific outcome hierarchy. Pertinent to
   President Trump's policies, the authors propose an alternative
   hypothesis grounded in the sociology of law: the comparative
   effectiveness of civil rights policies is best explained by the extent
   to which each policy incorporated a group-centered effects (GCE)
   statutory and enforcement framework. Focusing on systemic group
   disadvantage rather than individual harm, discriminatory consequences
   rather than discriminatory intent, and substantive group results over
   individual justice, GCE offers an alternative theoretical framework for
   analyzing comparative civil rights outcomes.

   is the extent to which this technology breaks with Mendelian single

   genetic information that could be used to establish complex multicausal
   interactions at the molecular level, geneticists actively work to

AB This article considers the effects on the wage structure of the U.S.
   economy's growing reliance on demand from high-income consumers.
   Relative to the mass consumers that defined the post-World War II U.S.
   economy, high-income consumers are willing to pay for high-quality and
   high-status products. These spending patterns split producers into
   up-market and down-market segments and stoke winner-take-all dynamics
   among up-market producers. Economic dependence on high-income consumers
   could thus lead to a new form of industrial segmentation, based on
   vertical differentiation by product quality or status. To test these
   predictions, data from consumer expenditure and wage surveys are linked
   using input-output tables and used to fit variance function regressions.
   Results show that industries more dependent on high-income consumers
   have greater wage inequality. This analysis identifies a new structural
   source of wage inequality not considered in previous research: the
   increasingly unequal composition of consumer demand reproduces wage
   inequality.

AB Why would market organizations engage in symbolic and material acts
   conveying appreciation and respect to other organizations that confirm
   their inferior position in an established hierarchy? The authors argue
   that deference is the price outsider organizations pay to pass
   categorical and symbolic boundaries and gain acceptance in contexts
   where insiders regard them as impure. Because not all organizations can
   or are willing to pay the price, deference varies according to
   positional, dispositional, and interactional characteristics. The
   authors examine and find support for the view of organizational
   deference as strategic behavior using empirical evidence on market
   finance organizations investing in film production in France over two
   decades. The analysis expands research on nonconflictual interactions
   and symbolic boundaries in market settings.

AB This paper introduces a new IV strategy based on IVF (in vitro
   fertilization) induced fertility variation among childless women to
   estimate the causal effect of having children on their career. For this
   purpose, we use administrative data on IVF treated women in Denmark.
   Because observed chances of IVF success do not depend on labor market
   histories, IVF treatment success provides a plausible instrument for
   childbearing. Our IV estimates indicate that fertility effects on
   earnings are: (i) negative, large, and long- lasting; (ii) driven by
   fertility effects on hourly earnings and not so much on labor supply;
   and (iii) much stronger at the extensive margin than at the intensive
   margin.

AB Despite the theoretical importance of intragenerational mobility and its
   connection to intergenerational mobility, no study since the 1970s has
   documented trends in intragenerational occupational mobility. The
   present article fills this intellectual gap by presenting evidence of an
   increasing trend in intragenerational mobility in the United States from
   1969 to 2011. We decompose the trend using a nested occupational
   classification scheme that distinguishes between disaggregated
   micro-classes and progressively more aggregated meso-classes,
   macro-classes, and manual and nonmanual sectors. Log-linear analysis
   reveals that mobility increased across the occupational structure at
   nearly all levels of aggregation, especially after the early 1990s.
   Controlling for structural changes in occupational distributions
   modifies, but does not substantially alter, these findings. Trends are
   qualitatively similar for men and women. We connect increasing mobility
   to other macro-economic trends dating back to the 1970s, including
   changing labor force composition, technologies, employment relations,
   and industrial structures. We reassert the sociological significance of
   intragenerational mobility and discuss how increasing variability in
   occupational transitions within careers may counteract or mask trends in
   intergenerational mobility, across occupations and across more broadly
   construed social classes.

AB That the anarchic system generates incentives for states to balance each
   other's power is conventional wisdom in international relations. As
   such, the contemporary unipolar system is an anomaly. Observers explain
   its existence in several ways, including the benevolence of US hegemony
   and the constraints international institutions impose on the exercise of
   US power. None of them, however, explain what is perhaps the most
   puzzling outcome of the Soviet collapse: the decision of the United
   States to maintain its level of military spending. To explain its
   choice, we extend the seminal argument Waltz advanced long ago to a
   dynamic setting. Using a simple model, we show that the interest of the
   unipole in deterring a challenge to its power can induce it to continue
   to invest in guns rather than to shift its resources to the production
   of butter. This strategy can enable the incumbent unipole to pre-empt
   the balancing process that has long been thought to be central to state
   survival under anarchy.

AB Although girls outperform boys in academic achievement in general, boys
   still have an advantage in STEM fields in many countries. One possible
   explanation for the female disadvantage in maths and their
   under-representation in technical professions is culturally embedded
   beliefs about female inferiority and male superiority in maths and
   related disciplines. On the one hand, these beliefs can lead to
   different subject-specific investment strategies of female and male
   students. On the other hand, the presence of negative stereotypes about
   girls' lower competencies in maths in classrooms can hamper girls'
   performance via stereotype threat by their peers' expectation.
   Accordingly, not only the own beliefs are relevant but also the
   attitudes of classmates that can reinforce behaviour patterns of
   adolescents conforming the prevailing gender norms. Using data from the
   Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries,
   we investigate whether students' gender roles and norms and their
   classmates' attitudes towards gender norms bring forward stereotypical
   maths performance at school in Germany. Our results indicate a distinct
   gender differential in favour of boys. We find evidence that female
   students perform particularly worse in classrooms in which traditional
   masculinity norms are present, while in classrooms with no or low
   approval of these norms, no statistically significant gap is apparent.

AB International trade directly influences US presidential elections. We
   explore the electoral implications of the increasing tradability of
   services and the large US surplus in services trade. Our paper builds on
   prior work showing that job insecurity from import competition in
   manufacturing diminishes political support for incumbents. We construct
   novel measures of the tradability of an industry using
   establishment-level data covering nearly all US economic activity. We
   find increases in incumbent party vote shares in counties with large
   numbers of workers in high-skilled tradable services as well as goods,
   and decreases in counties with high employment in low-skilled
   manufacturing. Incumbent parties are particularly vulnerable to losing
   votes in swing states with many low-skilled manufacturing workers. In
   national-level models, we show for the first time that increasing
   imports (exports) are associated with decreasing (increasing)
   presidential incumbent vote shares. The national-level effects are large
   and politically consequential. We also find an Electoral College
   incentive to protect the manufacturing sector and to oppose trade
   agreements.

AB Regime type has opposing effects on terrorism. If a regime constrains
   the executive branch, then terrorism may be more prevalent. If, however,
   a regime allows all viewpoints to be represented, then grievances may be
   held in check, resulting in less terrorism. Regimes that value
   constituents' lives and property will also act to limit attacks. We
   formulate a game-theoretic model, containing a terrorist group and
   targeted government, that captures these opposing forces and supports a
   nonlinear relationship between regime type and terrorism. This model
   indicates how diverse samples in the literature can result in different
   relationships between regime type and terrorism. Seldom does it support
   the positive relationship that is prevalent in the terrorism literature.
   We apply a large variety of empirical techniques to show that regime
   type has a robust inverted U-shaped impact on various terrorism
   measures. Foreign policy variables (e.g., alliance with the United
   States) are not a robust influence on terrorism.

AB Bargaining models play a central role in international relations,
   particularly in the study of conflict. A common criticism of this
   approach is that it fails to account for nonmaterial (e.g.,
   psychological) factors that may influence the bargaining process. We
   augment a standard bargaining model by allowing actors' preferences over
   conflict to diverge from the fitness payoffs (e.g., resources) typical
   of such models. Preferences are subject to evolutionary forcesthose who
   attain high fitness reproduce more. We find that (1) there is a
   trade-off where being irrationally tough leads to better bargains but
   also more inefficient conflict; (2) actors develop behavioral biases
   consistent with empirical findings from psychology and behavioral
   economics; and (3) these behavioral biases inevitably lead to conflict.
   By bridging the strategic and psychological approaches to conflict, our
   models provide new insights into questions such as how changes in
   military and intelligence-gathering technology affect the likelihood and
   expected cost of war, and how to interpret the purported decline of
   violence over recent human history.

AB The treatment of foreign investment has become the most controversial
   issue in global governance. At the center of the controversy lies the
   mechanism of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), which allows
   private firms legal recourse against governments if government
   interference has degraded their investment. Using newly released data
   covering 742 investment disputes, I assess some of the central claims
   about ISDS. I argue that the regime has indeed undergone an important
   shift: a majority of claims today deal not with direct takings by
   low-rule-of-law countries, but with regulation in democratic states.
   Such indirect expropriation claims have seen a precipitous decrease in
   their odds of legal success over the past twenty years. They are also
   far less likely to result in early settlement. These parallel trends may
   be a result of a rise in strategic litigation by investors whose aim is
   not only to obtain compensation but also to deter governments'
   regulatory ambitions.

AB Self-determination claims have abounded in the international system
   since the end of World War II. But these claims have not emerged
   everywhere. About half of the states in the international system face
   some challenge related to self-determination today. Why do some states
   face these demands while others do not? We argue that ethno-national
   self-determination is one of many identities with which individuals can
   find affinity. While an international norm related to self-determination
   has developed globally, its use as a basis for political claims has
   diffused regionally. Diffusion of self-determination occurs through
   observation of others using self-determination as a basis of
   organization, generating a sense of legitimacy, sensitivity to related
   grievance, and perceptions of tangible benefits related to
   self-determination identification. We test this empirically on global
   data on self-determination claims from 1960 to 2005 and find evidence of
   spatial diffusion, suggesting that self-determination is, to some
   extent, contagious.

AB Theory and extensive evidence connect poverty and underdevelopment to
   civil conflict yet evidence on the impact of development programs on
   violence is surprisingly mixed. To break this impasse, we exploit a
   within-country policy experiment to examine the conditions under which
   antipoverty programs reduce violence. The roll-out of India's National
   Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme caused a large long-run reduction in
   Maoist conflict violence, as measured with an original data set based on
   local-language press sources. These pacifying effects were not uniform,
   however, but overwhelmingly concentrated in districts with sufficient
   pre-existing local state capacity to implement the program effectively.
   The results demonstrate the potential for anti-poverty programs to

   highlight the crucial role of state capacity in shaping these effects.

   theoretical framework in which suicide is a symptom of an anomic state
   of society can help us understand the diversity of trajectories that
   transnational migrants follow and that shape their suicide rates within
   a cosmopolitan society. Drawing on ethnographic data collected on eight
   suicides and three attempted suicide cases of second-generation male
   Alevi Kurdish migrants living in London, this article explains the
   impact of segmented assimilation/adaptation trajectories on the
   incidence of suicide and how their membership of a 'new rainbow

   anomic social position with a lack of integration and regulation.

AB In the context of increasing cross-border mobility and the associated
   interconnections and diversities, 'cosmopolitanism' has become a key
   concept in sociology. Understood as individual real-world orientation,
   many authors consider a central cause for cosmopolitanism in
   physical-corporeal mobility, in particular transnationally. However, the
   significance of virtual and imagined mobility, such as via television or
   the Internet, is increasingly emphasized. Nevertheless, it has so far
   been little examined how and with which relative strength
   physical-corporeal and virtual-imagined mobility are associated with
   cosmopolitan orientations. Unlike previous studies, the two forms of
   mobility are considered simultaneously. On the basis of existing studies
   and theoretical considerations, it is assumed that the dimension of
   global orientation is influenced rather by physical-corporeal than by
   virtual-imagined mobility, whereas the dimension of cultural openness is
   influenced rather by virtual-imagined than by physical mobility. One
   reason could be the different potential of the mobility forms to respond
   to perceived conflicts in the confrontation with the Other. The
   hypotheses are preliminary tested using data from an online survey that
   allows both to distinguish locals, ( national) shuttles and
   transnationals, and to query media use. An exploratory principal
   component analysis confirmed, as in other studies, that global
   orientation and cultural openness are distinct dimensions. The results
   of the multivariate analyses largely support the hypotheses and indicate
   that in investigations of cosmopolitanism, the processes of
   identity-related self-categorization should be distinguished from pure
   socialization processes.

AB This article assesses how processes of social closure enhance
   intergenerational immobility in the regulated professions and thus
   promote persistence at the top of the occupational hierarchy. We compare
   four European countries (GB, Germany, Denmark and Sweden) that differ
   considerably in their degree of professional regulation and in their
   broader institutional arrangements. We run log-linear and logistic
   regression models on a cumulative dataset based on three large-scale
   surveys with detailed and highly comparable information at the level of
   unit occupations. Our analyses indicate that children of licensed
   professionals are far more likely to inherit the occupation of their
   parents and that this stronger micro-class immobility translates into
   higher chances of persistence in the upper class. These results support
   social closure theory and confirm the relevance of a micro-class
   approach for the explanation of social fluidity and of its
   cross-national variations. Moreover, we find that, when children of
   professionals do not reproduce the micro-class of their parents, they
   still display disproportionate chances of persistence in professional
   employment. Hence, on the one hand, processes of social closure erect
   barriers between professions and fuel micro-class immobility at the top.
   On the other hand, the cultural proximity of different professional
   groups drives intense intergenerational exchanges between them. Our
   analyses indicate that these micro-and meso-class rigidities work as
   complementary routes to immobility at the top.

AB This paper argues that shifts in access to housing - both in relation to
   rental and ownership - disrupt middle-class reproduction in ways that
   fundamentally influence class formation. While property ownership has
   had a long association with middle-class identities, status and
   distinction, an increasingly competitive rental market alongside
   inflated property prices has impacted on expectations and anxieties over
   housing futures. In this paper, we consider two key questions: (1) What
   happens to middle-class identities under the conditions of this wider
   structural change? (2) How do the middle classes variously manoeuvre
   within this? Drawing on empirical research conducted in London, we
   demonstrate that becoming an owner-occupier may be fractured along lines
   of class but also along the axes of age, wealth and timing, particularly
   as this relates to the housing market. It builds on understandings of
   residential status and place as central to the formation of class,
   orienting this around the recognition of both people and place as
   mutable, emphasizing that changing economic and social processes
   generate new class positionalities and strategies for class
   reproduction. We argue that these processes are writ large in practices

AB This article asks: how is class consciousness and cohesiveness amongst
   the UK business elite maintained in the twenty-first century? Elite
   studies traditionally sought to account for the construction and
   circulation of dominant ideology through exclusive education systems,
   institutional board interlocks and club memberships. The problem is that
   business elite membership of all these institutions has been steady
   declining in recent decades. Contemporary corporate elites now appear
   more mobile and fragmented in an age of globalization. However, class
   cohesion amongst business leaders appears as strong as ever after
   decades of neoliberal policy hegemony. So, how are such ideas, norms and
   values circulated and maintained? This study tried to answer this
   question drawing on a set of 30 semi-structured interviews with top UK
   CEOs and a demographic audit of current FTSE 100 CEOs. The findings
   suggest that three additional means of achieving business elite
   coherence have become more significant: professional business education,
   semi-formal but regular meeting sites, and specialist business media.

AB The corporate pursuit of social goals - known as Corporate Social
   Responsibility or 'CSR' - has been subject to critique on a number of
   grounds. However, a hitherto underexplored potential consequence of CSR
   has been suggested in a recent paper by C. Garsten and K. Jacobsson
   ('Post-Political Regulation: Soft Power and Post-political Visions in
   Global Governance' (2013), Critical Sociology 39: 421-37). They suggest
   that CSR is part of an international trend towards 'post-political'
   governance discourses, where an emphasis on different actors' common
   goals obscures conflicts of interest, subverting the open political
   conflict necessary for a well-functioning democracy. This paper examines
   whether such post-political discourses - including an outright denial of
   conflict of interest can be found within the alcohol and gambling
   industries, where conflicts of interest are likely to be particularly
   acute given the addictive nature of the goods/services in question.
   Based on interviews with CSR professionals in these industries in Italy,
   the UK, and at EU-level, we do indeed find evidence of a post-political
   discourse. In these discourses, alcohol/gambling industry staff deny
   potential conflicts of interest on the basis that any small benefits
   from sales to a small number of addicts are seen to be outweighed by the
   reputational damage that addicts cause. Crucially, however, this
   coexists with another, less post-political discourse, where addictions
   CSR professionals emphasize 'common ground' as a basis for CSR, while
   accepting some instances of possible conflict of interest. Here
   interviewees make considerable efforts to differentiate good
   (sustainable) from bad (short-term) self-interest in order to stress the
   genuineness of their own actions. We conclude the paper by considering
   whether CSR embedded within a 'common ground' discourse still hides
   conflicts of interests and subverts democratic debate, or overcomes the
   problems identified by Garsten and Jacobsson.

AB This paper argues that periodic waves of crowding-in to 'hot' issue
   fields are a recurring feature of how globally networked civil society
   organizations operate, especially in countries of the Global South. We
   elaborate on this argument through a study of Indian civil society
   mobilization around climate change. Five key mechanisms contribute to
   crowding-in processes: (1) the expansion of discursive opportunities;
   (2) the event effects of global climate change conferences; (3) the
   network effects created by expanding global civil society networks; (4)
   the adoption and innovation of action repertoires; and (5) global
   pressure effects creating new opportunities for civil society. Our
   findings contribute to the world society literature, with an account of
   the social mechanisms through which global institutions and political
   events affect national civil societies, and to the social movements
   literature by showing that developments in world society are essential
   contributors to national mobilization processes.

   investigates whether engagement in holistic activities is associated

   To analyse this question, respondents who are engaged in holistic
   activities are divided into three groups that are compared with each
   other as well as with Christians and non-religious people. The findings
   show that the three holistic groups are characterized by clearly
   different attitudinal patterns: Respondents engaged in body-mind-spirit
   activities have an affinity to self-directed ways of life,
   post-materialism and environmentalism. Holistic Christians try to
   combine the Christian ideal of altruism and post-materialist
   orientations. Those who are attracted only to magical-occult practices
   are primarily concerned with individualistic self-improvement and
   correspond more to the image of the hedonist consumer at the esoteric

AB Contrasting the classical explanation of military group cohesion as
   sustained by interpersonal bonds, recent scholars have highlighted the
   importance of ritualized communication, training and drills in
   explaining effective military performance in professional armies. While
   this has offered a welcome addition to the cohesion literature and a
   novel micro-sociological method of examining cohesion, its primary
   evidential base has been combat groups. Indeed, despite their prominent
   role in directing operations over the past decade, the British Army's
   officer corps has received relatively little attention from sociologists
   during this period. No attempt has been made to explain cohesion in the
   officer corps. Using a similar method to recent cohesion scholars, this
   paper seeks to address this imbalance by undertaking a micro-sociology
   of one ritual in particular: 'Barossa Night' in the Royal Irish
   Regiment. Firstly, it draws on the work of Durkheim to examine how
   cohesion amongst the officer corps is created and sustained through a
   dense array of practises during formal social rituals. It provides
   evidence that the use of rituals highlights that social solidarity is
   central to understanding officer cohesion. Secondly, following Hockey's
   work on how private soldiers negotiate order, the paper shows how this
   solidarity in the officer corps is based on a degree of negotiated order
   and the need to release organizational tensions inherent in a strictly
   hierarchical rank structure. It highlights how the awarding of gallantry
   medals can threaten this negotiated order and fuel deviancy. In
   examining this behaviour, the paper shows that even amongst an officer
   class traditionally viewed as the elite upholders of organizational
   discipline, the negotiation of rank and hierarchy can be fluid. How
   deviant behaviour is later accepted and normalized by senior officers
   indicates that negotiated order is as important to understanding
   cohesion in the British Army's officer corps as it is amongst private
   soldiers.

   inclusive masculinity scholars, respondents maintained emotional
   closeness and physical tactility with male teammates and friends. These
   more inclusive attitudes and homosocial behaviours were, however,
   slightly more conservative than in other recent research. We close by
   explaining this variation with reference to theoretical apparatus'

AB In research on fatherhood premiums and motherhood penalties in

   argued to constitute a possible explanation for observed gender gaps.
   However, there is as yet no conclusive evidence of such discrimination.
   Utilizing a field experiment design, we test (i) whether job applicants
   are subject to recruitment discrimination on the basis of their gender
   and parenthood status, and (ii) whether discrimination by gender and
   parenthood is conditional on the qualifications required by the job
   applied for. We applied for 2,144 jobs in the Swedish labour market,
   randomly assigning gender and parenthood status to fictitious job
   applicants. Based on the rate of callbacks, we do not find that
   employers practise systematic recruitment discrimination on the basis of
   the job applicants' gender or parental status, neither in relation to
   less qualified nor more highly qualified jobs.

   difficult, as the factors are related to each other as well as to a host

   separate culture and institutions by investigating outcomes of
   immigrants with different cultures living in the same institutional
   environment. We show that estimates from studies using this approach are
   likely to be biased upwards. Having access to very detailed registry
   data on the whole Norwegian population, we are able to rely on an
   extended epidemiological approach whereby we compare the outcomes of
   different sex, second-generation immigrant siblings. We find a robust
   effect of ancestry culture on female employment, but it is smaller than

   Educational attainment is known to influence differently the union

   have been traditionally explained using the economic interpretation of
   education. We suggest that looking at fields of study may yield
   additional insights and offer a more comprehensive picture for
   understanding union entry patterns. The analysis focusses on the effect
   of three dimensions of education-educational level, enrolment, and
   field-on first union entry and union type. We find that educational
   field is important not only as a control variable that helps add nuance
   to the relation between educational level and family formation, but also
   in and of itself. The findings suggest that the field of study reflects
   unobserved value orientations but also different degrees of

   the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (2002, 2007, 2012; N = 28,650
   individuals), we apply random-effects growth curve models to test our
   expectations. We find that mothers' personal wealth growth rates are
   lower compared to childless women and compared to fathers. A
   considerable share of this association can be explained by discontinuous
   employment experiences of women in Germany, a context with a dominant
   male-breadwinner model. The wealth accumulation of mothers is
   additionally depressed by early first births and non-marital births. For
   men, parenthood is not generally associated with wealth accumulation,
   but we identify variation in the association with regard to the timing
   of and marital status at first birth. These results reveal a substantial
   motherhood wealth penalty previously hidden in analyses of
   household-level wealth, thereby contributing to our understanding of
   gender inequalities in economic well-being over the life course.

   First, it advances our understanding of the interplay between positive
   and negative intergroup contact experiences by testing whether positive
   intergroup contact serves as a buffer for the prejudice-enhancing effect
   of negative intergroup contact, as well as the other way around.
   Secondly, by using longitudinal data, it provides a stricter test of the
   relationship between negative contact and prejudice among adolescents.
   Hybrid models with two-wave panel data showed that the transition from
   having no friends from an ethnic outgroup to having a share of friends
   from an ethnic outgroup results in lower interethnic prejudice, both for
   Dutch majority and minority group pupils. Furthermore, we found the
   transition from having no foes to having one or more foes from an ethnic
   outgroup to be associated with higher levels of prejudice. We did not
   find evidence for buffering effects of intergroup contact.

AB While many advocate 'lifelong learning' as the ideal career model, its
   impact on workers' lives is still partly unclear. Especially research on
   monetary returns to further education has yielded mixed evidence. I
   argue that a thorough assessment has to consider both the types of
   courses and the segmentation of labour markets. Using data from the
   German National Educational Panel Study, I test explanations of
   differing returns to non-formal further education in Germany, a country
   known for its highly segmented labour market. Results confirm that the
   returns to short non-formal training courses, which are the most common
   forms of further education in Germany, differ remarkably between types
   of courses and segments. Employer-mandated courses yield the highest
   returns, which is especially pronounced in internal labour markets.
   Furthermore, there are no returns on closed occupational labour markets.
   In occupations, where formal credentials are less important, returns to
   training are present. These results suggest that returns depend less on
   individual decisions to invest in training and more on the context.
   Hence, these findings go against human capital explanations and instead
   support implications of the Job Competition Model and Credentialism,
   which emphasize the importance of labour market structure.

AB This article examines whether gender segregation across fields of study
   in higher education varies between children coming from different
   socio-economic groups, and changed across time. A possible
   intersectionality between gender and socio-economic background has
   hardly been addressed thus far. Using Dutch survey data covering cohorts
   born between the 1930s and 1980s, I study trends in gender segregation
   across seven broad fields in post-secondary education, and examine
   whether gender segregation is different across parental educational
   levels. Segregation is found to diminish over time, although the trend
   has stalled. Segregation is, in some fields, less strong among children
   of higher social origins, both because higher-socio-economic status
   (SES) daughters are more likely to enrol in the science, technology,
   engineering, and math fields, and because higher-SES sons are more
   likely to enrol in health than their lower-SES counterparts. Tentative
   explanations for these findings are presented that relate to stronger
   gender-typical socialization in lower-SES families, and potential
   differential abilities in mathematics and languages across SES groups.

AB Men have historically attained more education than women, but this
   gender imbalance in education has reversed in many countries. In recent
   cohorts, the wife typically has as much as or more education than the
   husband. Using data from the European Union's Statistics on Income and
   Living Conditions (N = 95,389 for 27 countries), this article
   investigates to what extent the newly emerging pattern of educational
   assortative mating is associated with a higher proportion of women who
   out-earn their partners in Europe. We find that this proportion varies
   on the country level between 20 per cent and almost 50 per cent for
   childless women and is generally much lower for women with small
   children. However, if a woman is better educated than her partner, this
   clearly increases the odds that she earns more than half of the couple's
   joint earnings. This happens to such an extent that it reduces the
   effect of motherhood on the wife's relative earnings: college-educated
   mothers of school-age children with less educated partners are nearly as
   likely to be main breadwinners as college-educated childless women in a
   homogamous union.

AB This article reimagines poverty governance as a labor process. Extending
   theories of bureaucratic fields and street-level bureaucracies, the
   proposed model suggests that the state manages the poor through
   fragmented activities embedded in horizontal and vertical relations of
   production. I use an ethnography of 911 ambulance operations in a single
   California county to advance this perspective. From plugging gunshot
   wounds to moving sidewalk slumberers, ambulance crews interact with a
   mostly impoverished clientele base by transforming spaces in bodies and
   bodies in spaces. This two-sided governance puts the ambulance in
   recurrent contact with the hospital emergency department and the police
   squad car. Across these institutions, ambulance crews struggle with
   their nurse and police counterparts over the horizontal shuffling of
   burdensome work, shaping the life chances of their subjects in the
   process. At the same time, bureaucratic and capitalistic forces from
   above activate a lean ambulance fleet that is minimally wasteful and
   highly flexible. This verticality structures clientele processing
   through the ambulance and fuels tensions across the frontlines of
   governance. In an effort to advance theory and fill an empirical gap,
   this article proposes a new model for understanding the management of
   marginality and highlights an overlooked case of poverty regulation.

AB Within seemingly weak states, exceptionally effective subunits lie
   hidden. These high-performing niches exhibit organizational
   characteristics distinct from poor-performing peer organizations, but
   also distinct from high-functioning organizations in Western countries.
   This article develops the concept of interstitial bureaucracy to explain
   how and why unusually high-performing state organizations in developing
   countries invert canonical features of Weberian bureaucracy. Interstices
   are distinct-yet-embedded subsystems characterized by practices
   inconsistent with those of the dominant institution. This interstitial
   position poses particular challenges and requires unique solutions.
   Interstices cluster together scarce proto-bureaucratic resources to
   cultivate durable distinction from the status quo, while managing
   disruptions arising from interdependencies with the wider neopatrimonial
   field. I propose a framework for how bureaucratic interstices respond to
   those challenges, generalizing from organizational comparisons within
   the Ghanaian state and abbreviated historical comparison cases from the
   nineteenth-century United States, early-twentieth-century China,
   mid-twentieth-century Kenya, and early-twenty-first-century Nigeria.

AB At the turn of the century, regulators introduced policies to control
   bank risk-taking. Many banks appointed chief risk officers (CROs), yet
   bank holdings of new, complex, and untested financial derivatives
   subsequently soared. Why did banks expand use of new derivatives? We
   suggest that CROs encouraged the rise of new derivatives in two ways.
   First, we build on institutional arguments about the expert construction
   of compliance, suggesting that risk experts arrived with an agenda of
   maximizing risk-adjusted returns, which led them to favor the
   derivatives. Second, we build on moral licensing arguments to suggest
   that bank appointment of CROs induced organizational licensing, leading
   trading-desk managers to reduce policing of their own risky behavior. We
   further argue that CEOs and fund managers bolstered or restrained
   derivatives use depending on their financial interests. We predict that
   CEOs favored new derivatives when their compensation rewarded
   risk-taking, but that both CEOs and fund managers opposed new
   derivatives when they held large illiquid stakes in banks. We test these
   predictions using data on derivatives holdings of 157 large banks
   between 1995 and 2010.

AB The gendering of occupational roles affects a variety of outcomes for
   workers and organizations. We examine how the gender of an initial role
   occupant influences the authority enjoyed by individuals who
   subsequently fill that role. We use data from a microfinance bank in
   Central America to examine how working initially with a male or female
   loan manager shapes borrowers' compliance with future managers'
   directives. First, we show that borrowers originally paired with female
   managers continue to be less compliant with subsequent managers,
   regardless of subsequent managers' gender. Next, we demonstrate how
   compliance is shaped by the gender-typing of the role and the gender of
   the individual who fills that role. We find that men enjoy significantly
   greater compliance in male-typed roles, but male and female managers
   experience similar levels of compliance in female-typed roles. Further
   analyses reveal that these gendered patterns become especially
   pronounced after managers demonstrate their authority by disciplining
   borrowers. Overall, we show how quickly gendered expectations become
   inscribed into occupational roles, and we identify their lasting
   organizational consequences. More broadly, we suggest authority
   mechanisms that may contribute to the stalled gender revolution in the
   workplace.

AB During the past few decades, licensure, a state-enforced mechanism for
   regulating occupational entry, quickly became the most prevalent form of
   occupational closure. Broad consensus among researchers holds that
   licensure creates wage premiums by establishing economic monopolies.
   This article demonstrates that, contrary to established wisdom,
   licensure does not limit competition, nor does it increase wages.
   Results are based on a new occupational dataset, covering 30 years, that
   exploits interstate variability in licensure across the 300
   census-identified occupations. I argue that licensure, instead of
   increasing wages, creates a set of institutional mechanisms that enhance
   entry into the occupation, particularly for historically disadvantaged
   groups, while simultaneously stagnating quality.

AB Most research on segregation in social networks considers small circles
   of strong ties, and little is known about segregation among the much
   larger number of weaker ties. This article proposes a novel approach to
   the study of these more extended networks, through the use of data on
   personal ties in an online social network. We illustrate this method's
   potential by describing and explaining the degree of ethnic and gender
   segregation on Facebook among a representative survey of adolescents in
   the Netherlands (N = 2,810; similar to 1.1 million Facebook friends).
   The results show that large online networks are more strongly segregated
   by ethnicity than by gender. Drawing on the same survey data, we find
   that core networks are more segregated in terms of ethnicity and gender
   than are extended networks. However, an exception to this pattern is
   personal networks of ethnic majority members, whose core networks are as
   segregated by ethnicity as their extended networks. Further analysis
   suggests this exception is due to their larger population size and the
   ethnic segregation of their social settings. We discuss the implications
   of these findings for the role of structural opportunities, homophily,
   and balance.

AB This article builds on research demonstrating that high levels of
   economic and physical security are conducive to a shift from materialist
   to postmaterialist values-and that this shift tends to make people more
   favorable to important social changes. This article updates this
   research, demonstrating that: (1) These value changes occur with
   exceptionally large time lags between the onset of the conditions
   conducive to them, and the societal changes they produce-as previous
   work implies but does not demonstrate. The evidence suggests that there
   was a time lag of forty to fifty years between when Western societies
   first attained high levels of economic and physical security after World
   War II, and related societal changes such as legalization of same-sex
   marriage. (2) A distinctive set of "individual-choice norms," dealing
   with acceptance of gender equality, divorce, abortion, and
   homosexuality, is moving on a different trajectory from other cultural
   changes. These norms are closely linked with human fertility rates and
   require severe self-repression. (3) Although basic values normally
   change at the pace of intergenerational population replacement, the
   shift from pro-fertility norms to individual-choice norms is now moving
   much faster, having reached a tipping point where conformist pressures
   have reversed polarity and are now accelerating changes they once
   resisted. We test these claims against data from eighty countries
   containing most of the world's population, surveyed from 1981 to 2014.

AB This article poses a framework for considering the social processes that
   drive masculinity's enaction, including men's presentation of gender,
   masculinity's intersituational flexibility, and the persistence of
   gender inequality. I draw on ethnographic observation and in-depth
   interviews conducted in a small cockfighting community in Hawaii. On the
   surface, my findings are surprisingly counter-Geertzian: within Hawaiian
   cockfighting's uncontestedly masculine and almost exclusively male
   context, fighters carry out behaviors they consider "feminine" in other
   areas of their lives, such as caretaking, nurturing, and overt emotional
   expression. I draw on existing theoretical frameworks, including hybrid
   masculinities, to use Hawaiian cockfighting as a vehicle for elaborating
   our understanding of the sociology of masculinity. I argue that rather
   than approximating an archetypal masculinity, "ideal" masculine
   performance incorporates a balance of masculinized and feminized traits.
   This tempered incarnation of masculinity is enacted in particular
   localized contexts to deliberately fall "short" of archetypal
   masculinity. I introduce the term "masculine undercompensation" to
   describe the mechanism through which subordinate masculinities are
   incorporated to create a tempered, locally contingent masculine
   performance. The processes I identify strengthen and contextualize the
   growing literature documenting how hybridization can contribute to the
   maintenance of unequal gender relations.

AB We analyzed a random sample of individual listings from an online market
   for peer-to-peer lending to examine the effects of gender and
   attractiveness on receiving loans. In this setting, we tested the
   theoretical argument that women are penalized for violating beliefs
   about women's social roles when they seek loans for male-typed
   endeavors, such as running a business. Consistent with this theory,
   female borrowers seeking loans for business purposes were less likely to
   receive funding. Surprisingly, women's facial attractiveness moderated
   this effect: women seeking business loans were even less likely to
   receive funding if they were attractive. This result qualifies the
   conventional notion of beauty as a diffuse asset and underscores the
   alternative idea that beauty may accentuate perceived femininity and
   thus exacerbate the disadvantages that women face in male-typed domains.
   Overall, our research shows that gender beliefs about task-relevant
   competence can carry over from more formalized organizational contexts
   into new forms of online transactions that are designed to reduce biases
   that result from face-to-face interactions.

AB Job mobility offers opportunities for workers to obtain wage increases,
   but the returns on job changes differ considerably. We argue that part
   of this inequality results from a trade-off between occupational and
   regional mobility. Both mobility types offer alternative strategies for
   improving one's labor market position; however, each type also has
   unique restrictions. The high costs of regional mobility can thus induce
   occupational changes, even though the resulting human-capital
   devaluation leads to lower wage increases. We use linked retrospective
   life-course data for Germany (ALWA-ADIAB) and apply competing risks
   models to show that restrictions on one type of mobility drive
   individuals toward the other type of mobility. Using fixed-effects
   regressions, we then show that regional mobility yields higher wage
   improvements than occupational mobility does. We argue that restrictions
   on both types of mobility thus not only determine which type of mobility
   is chosen, thereby helping explain differential careers, but also
   contribute to inequality in wage trajectories due to differential
   returns on job mobility. The trade-off has explanatory power for the
   inequality between certain actors with different sets of mobility
   restrictions, such as parents and non-parents or employees in jobs with
   different skill demands, and it may also contribute to our better
   understanding of broader patterns of inequality-for instance, that
   caused by between-nation differences in job mobility.

AB Some previous studies of the relationship between women's labor force
   participation and household income inequality indicate that the
   promotion of the former has an equalizing effect on the latter; other
   studies insist that the promotion of women's labor force participation
   has a widening effect on household income inequality by way of the
   tendency toward assortative marriage. Hence, the relationship between
   women's labor force participation and household income inequality is
   unclear in the literature. This study aims to clarify the mechanism
   through which the interaction between household income and marriage
   produces social inequality by using mathematical and simulation-based
   approaches. The presented findings suggest that the promotion of women's
   labor force participation has a temporary widening effect on household
   income inequality, but an attenuating effect in the long run. They also
   state that assortative marriage itself has no widening effect on
   household income inequality, but rather an accelerating effect on
   widening inequality. Finally, by applying the model of that mechanism to
   Japan, I examine changes in household income inequality in that country.

AB A mid the long decline of US unions, research on union wage effects has
   struggled with selection problems and inadequate theory. I draw on the
   sociology of labor to argue that unions use non-market sources of power
   to pressure companies into raising wages. This theory of union power
   implies a new test of union wage effects: does union activism have an
   effect on wages that is not reducible to workers' market position? Two
   institutional determinants of union activity are used to empirically
   isolate the wage effect of union activism from labor market conditions:
   increased union revenue from investment shocks and increased union
   activity leading up to union officer elections. Instrumental variable
   analysis of panel data from the Department of Labor shows that a 1
   percent increase in union spending increases a proxy for union members'
   wages between 0.15 percent and 0.30 percent. These wage effects are
   larger in years of active collective bargaining, and when unions
   increase spending in ways that could pressure companies. The results
   indicate that non-market sources of union power can affect workers'
   wages and that even in a period of labor weakness unions still play a
   role in setting wages for their members.

AB Recent critiques of class analysis variously argue that aggregate class
   differences in life conditions and political attitudes have either
   declined to the point of irrelevance or decomposed into differences
   based on highly disaggregate occupations. This study empirically
   evaluates these arguments as they relate specifically to aggregate
   classes defined in terms of workplace ownership and authority relations,
   which are conceived to be distinct from both aggregate and disaggregate
   occupational classes based on the technical division of labor. A number
   of findings suggest that both the death and decomposition of class
   perspectives are in need of reconsideration or refinement. First,
   aggregate classes based on workplace ownership and authority cannot be
   conveniently disaggregated into smaller occupational classes based on
   the technical division of labor. Second, aggregate
   ownership-and-authority class differences in life conditions and
   political attitudes are statistically significant and substantively
   large across a wide variety of measures, and these differences are
   present even within disaggregate occupational classes. Third, aggregate
   ownership-and-authority class differences in life conditions and
   political attitudes show no evidence of declining since the 1970s. In
   fact, the only significant evidence of temporal change suggests a
   considerable increase in income inequality between positions in the
   workplace ownership and authority structure. The implications of these
   findings for class-analytic theory and research are discussed.

AB Do economic downturns induce class conflict over tax attitudes? Previous
   research casts doubt on this possibility and suggests that economic
   change exerts a minimal influence on welfare attitudes. Yet most of this
   research focuses on aggregate preferences, which potentially obscures
   important changes taking place at the level of social class. This study
   uses cross-national and temporal variation in unemployment rates as an
   empirical point of leverage to examine how unemployment rates influence
   class conflict over tax attitudes. The analysis combines
   individual-level data on tax attitudes (from different modules of the
   International Social Survey Programme) with country-level data on
   unemployment rates (from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
   Development) to create a dataset with information on both individuals'
   tax attitudes and larger unemployment rates. Findings from two-way
   fixed-effects logistic regression models indicate that rising
   unemployment induces class-based change in tax attitudes. High-level
   professionals and managers respond to rising unemployment by withdrawing
   support for raising tax progressivity. By contrast, manual workers
   (along with low-level professionals and managers) respond to rising
   unemployment by increasing their support for tax progressivity. The
   results are observed across two different data sources. The study
   suggests that economic changes can foster class polarization in
   political attitudes.

   present contrary evidence from two nationally representative samples of

   Further analyses also indicate that these disadvantages in the labor

AB There is long-standing concern about the mechanisms that lead to
   differential accumulation of retirement resources. As defined
   contribution (DC) plans have become the most common employer pension for
   US workers over recent decades, economic resources later in life
   increasingly depend on participating in voluntary, contributory pension
   instruments during working life. Using the Survey of Income and Program
   Participation linked to W-2 tax records containing respondents' annual
   contributions to DC retirement plans, we examine how participation in
   and contributions to DC plans among eligible US workers differ by
   education. Our analysis clarifies two central pathways associated with
   educational disparities in DC retirement plans. First, we disentangle
   the effects of education that operate via a labor market pathway,
   showing that a worker's earnings level is, by far, the most influential
   labor market factor associated with participation and contribution
   amounts. Second, we show an important independent effect of education on
   not only the decision to participate, but also how much money to set
   aside when participating, net of earnings and structural position in
   labor markets. Supplementary analyses using data from the Survey of
   Consumer Finances corroborate the importance of non-labor-market
   mechanisms for understanding the education gap in workplace retirement
   savings plans. Together, our results bring to center stage the
   importance of education in the process of stratification in retirement
   wealth formation and long-term financial security. Less educated workers
   face multiple disadvantages in the accumulation of retirement resources
   in the context of growing income inequality and changing employment
   institutions.

AB The positive link between marriage and health has frequently been
   analyzed and typically been interpreted in terms of health protection.
   Recently, the benefits of marriage have been criticized by sociologists
   who emphasize the strength of single persons in societies where being
   single is fully institutionalized. This paper reviews the evidence and
   addresses a number of unresolved issues in the literature, using recent
   annual panel data over a 16-year period from Switzerland. The findings
   cast doubts about the theory of health protection. The impact of "loss"
   (divorce) is about three times stronger than the impact of "gain"
   (marriage entry), and the effects of gain are often very small.
   Moreover, after marriage entry and after marriage exit, there is
   adjustment rather than accumulation. Especially after divorce, we find
   substantial recovery over the years. Finally, the results are highly
   sensitive to the outcome studied. Effects are strongest for life
   satisfaction, weak for mental health, and almost absent for two concrete
   health measures. We speculate that marriage is primarily linked to a
   more positive evaluation of one's life rather than to better health.

AB The high rate of obesity among adolescents is a global public health
   problem that has recently expanded to affect middle-and low-income
   countries. Brazil, which is undergoing a relatively rapid nutrition
   transition and has inadequate health systems, is currently experiencing
   the consequences of increasing rates of overweight and obesity
   concomitantly with the consequences of generations of malnourishment.
   Given this scenario, Brazil is an ideal context for examining the
   relationship between family socioeconomic status (SES) and adolescent
   body mass, as well as how this relationship varies across very different
   regions within the same country and across the body mass index (BMI)
   continuum. Guided by a framework that integrates nutrition transition
   and fundamental cause theories, we use unique nationally representative
   data with measured height and weight for all household members to
   conduct quantile regression models. The results suggest that family
   socioeconomic conditions are important theoretical factors associated
   with adolescent BMI, but that the way in which family SES impinges on
   adolescent BMI varies across regions characterized by different
   locations in the nutrition transition and varying levels of economic
   development. We also find that family socioeconomic disadvantages
   operate very differently according to BMI status. The results show that
   the socioeconomic gradient of adolescent BMI varies by stages of the
   nutrition transition and economic development and across BMI
   percentiles.

AB Why do certain protests prompt more intervention from the police? And
   why does the intensity of intervention vary over time? Drawing on
   analytical approaches in the protest policing literature, and on studies
   investigating the relationship between civil conflict, public opinion,
   and state repression, this study examines whether pro-Kurdish events in
   Turkey are treated more severely than others, and how the policing of
   these protests changes over time. Based on an original dataset, we
   analyze more than 10,000 protest events that took place in Turkey
   between 2000 and 2009. Our findings suggest that compared to others,
   pro-Kurdish events are more likely to encounter police action, one that
   particularly involves repressive strategies. We further show that
   repressive policing in pro-Kurdish events is more pronounced when the
   Kurdish armed insurgency against the state intensifies. Given that this
   is the first systematic quantitative study on protest policing in
   Turkey, it not only tests previously confirmed theories of protest
   policing, but also makes a theoretical contribution by providing a
   dynamic notion of threat beyond its situational forms, which builds on
   the conflict between the Turkish state and the PKK.

AB Group-based microcredit has become a globally adopted anti-poverty
   intervention. An important institutional variant of this is the
   self-help group (SHG) model, where non-commercialized lending is done
   through neighborhood-based savings and lending associations. We examine
   the effect of women's participation in SHGs in India on their social
   networks and social capital. We use household survey data, including
   rich social network information from seventy-five villages in rural
   Karnataka. In a context where women's interactions are largely
   restricted to their kinship networks and heavily constrained by rural
   life and patriarchal norms, participation in SHGs provides opportunities
   for socially isolated women to form new relationships. Descriptive
   analyses show that SHG participants, despite being more
   socioeconomically disadvantaged than non-participants, have
   significantly more incoming ties from nonkin than both non-participant
   women and men. After using propensity score matching to model selection
   into microcredit associations, we find consistent evidence that SHG
   participants have significantly more ties from nonkin and that these
   ties originate from other participants. We conclude that relationships
   formed within SHGs extend beyond the group and constitute important
   social capital, as women form friendships, give each other advice, and
   exchange vital basic needs resources.

AB International organizations are key players in globalization, but not
   all international organizations influence global processes in the same
   ways. In this paper, we argue that differences in international
   organizations' mobilizing structures can shape the extent to which these
   organizations can positively impact the practices of their members. We
   present the first comparative and quantitative assessment of world
   corporate social responsibility (CSR) associations that comprise
   business participants that act collectively to address pressing social
   and environmental concerns. We conduct time-series panel regression
   analyses of a unique dataset of business participation in three core
   world CSR associations and test their effects on business adoption of
   three major CSR frameworks and business performance across six major CSR
   evaluation schemes. Our findings reveal that world CSR associations with
   participatory structures, compared to those with honorific or
   convocational structures, more consistently encourage member businesses
   to adopt CSR policies and to achieve highly evaluated CSR practices. We
   discuss these results in relation to sociological and world society
   perspectives on international organizations as well as implications for
   future research on global corporate responsibility.

AB Pornography has become increasingly accessible in the United States, and
   particularly for younger Americans. While some research considers how
   pornography use affects the sexual and psychological health of
   adolescents and emerging adults, sociologists have given little
   attention to how viewing pornography may shape young Americans'
   connection to key social and cultural institutions, like religion. This
   article examines whether viewing pornography may actually have a
   secularizing effect, reducing young Americans' personal religiosity over
   time. To test for this, we use data from three waves of the National
   Study of Youth and Religion. Fixed-effects regression models show that
   more frequent pornography viewing diminishes religious service
   attendance, importance of religious faith, prayer frequency, and
   perceived closeness to God, while increasing religious doubts. These
   effects hold regardless of gender. The effects of viewing pornography on
   importance of faith, closeness to God, and religious doubts are stronger
   for teenagers compared to emerging adults. In light of the rapidly
   growing availability and acceptance of pornography for young Americans,
   our findings suggest that scholars must consider how increasingly
   pervasive pornography consumption may shape both the religious lives of
   young adults and also the future landscape of American religion more
   broadly.

AB If people enjoy giving, then why do they avoid fund-raisers? Partnering
   with the Salvation Army at Christmastime, we conducted a randomized
   field experiment placing bell ringers at one or both main entrances to a
   supermarket, making it easy or difficult to avoid the ask. Additionally,
   bell ringers either were silent or said please give. Making avoidance
   difficult increased both the rate of giving and donations.
   Paradoxically, the verbal ask dramatically increased giving but also led
   to dramatic avoidance. We argue that this illustrates sophisticated
   awareness of the empathy-altruism link: people avoid empathic
   stimulation to regulate their giving and guilt.

AB We evaluate the effects of the 2009 Home Affordable Modification Program
   (HAMP) that provided intermediaries with sizable financial incentives to
   renegotiate mortgages. HAMP increased intensity of renegotiations and
   prevented a substantial number of foreclosures but reached just
   one-third of its targeted indebted households. This shortfall was in
   large part due to low renegotiation intensity of a few large
   intermediaries and was driven by intermediary-specific factors.
   Exploiting regional variation in the intensity of program implementation
   by intermediaries suggests that the program was associated with a lower
   rate of foreclosures, consumer debt delinquencies, house price declines,
   and an increase in durable spending.

   external habit formation. The model generates realistic non-Gaussian
   features of consumption growth and fits standard salient features of
   asset prices including the means and volatilities of equity returns and
   a low risk-free rate. BEGE dynamics additionally allow the model to
   generate realistic properties of equity index options prices and their
   comovements with the macroeconomic outlook. In particular, when
   option-implied volatility is highas measured, for instance, by the VIX
   indexthe distribution of consumption growth is more negatively skewed.

AB Minority and disadvantaged students are typically underrepresented in
   selective programs that use merit-based admission. Urban school
   districts may set different referral and admission thresholds based on
   income and race (affirmative action), and they may exploit differences
   in achievement relative to ability across race and income groups
   (profiling). We develop and estimate a model that provides a unified
   treatment of affirmative action and profiling. We find profiling by race
   and income and affirmative action for low-income students.
   Counterfactual analysis reveals that these policies achieve more than 80
   percent of African American enrollment that could be attained by
   race-based affirmative action.

AB This paper studies strategic industry dynamics of creative destruction
   in which firms and technologies experience turnover. Theories predict
   that cannibalization between existing and new products delays
   incumbents' innovation, whereas preemptive motives accelerate it.
   Incumbents' cost (dis)advantage relative to that of entrants would
   further reinforce these tendencies. To empirically assess these three
   forces, I estimate a dynamic oligopoly model using a unique panel data
   set of hard disk drive manufacturers. The results suggest that despite
   strong preemptive motives and a substantial cost advantage over
   entrants, cannibalization makes incumbents reluctant to innovate, which
   can explain at least 57 percent of the incumbent-entrant innovation gap.

   changes in air pollution driven by the 1970 Clean Air Act to analyze the
   difference in outcomes between cohorts born in counties before and after
   large improvements in air pollution relative to those same cohorts born
   in counties that had no improvements. We find a significant relationship
   between pollution exposure in the year of birth and later-life outcomes.
   A higher pollution level in the year of birth is associated with lower
   labor force participation and lower earnings at age 30.

AB How does political unrest influence public policy? We assume that
   protests are an emotional reaction to unfair treatment. Individuals have
   a consistent view of fairness that internalizes government constraints.
   Individuals accept lower welfare if the government is more constrained.
   This resignation effect induces a benevolent government to delay
   unpleasant choices and accumulate public debt to mitigate social unrest.
   More radical and homogeneous groups are more prone to unrest and hence
   more influential. Even if the government is benevolent and all groups
   are identical in their propensity to riot, equilibrium policy can be
   distorted. The evidence is consistent with these implications.

AB Drawing on the social disorganization tradition and the social
   ecological perspective of Jane Jacobs, the authors hypothesize that
   neighborhoods composed of residents who intersect in space more
   frequently as a result of routine activities will exhibit higher levels
   of collective efficacy, intergenerational closure, and social network
   interaction and exchange. They develop this approach employing the
   concept of ecological networkstwo-mode networks that indirectly link
   residents through spatial overlap in routine activities. Using data from
   the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, they find evidence that
   econetwork extensity (the average proportion of households in the
   neighborhood to which a given household is tied through any location)
   and intensity (the degree to which household dyads are characterized by
   ties through multiple locations) are positively related to changes in
   social organization between 2000-2001 and 2006-2008. These findings
   demonstrate the relevance of econetwork characteristicsheretofore
   neglected in research on urban neighborhoodsfor consequential dimensions
   of neighborhood social organization.

AB We study how women's choices over labor activities in village economies
   correlate with poverty and whether enabling the poorest women to take on
   the activities of their richer counterparts can set them on a
   sustainable trajectory out of poverty. To do this we conduct a
   large-scale randomized control trial, covering over 21,000 households in
   1,309 villages surveyed four times over a seven-year period, to evaluate
   a nationwide program in Bangladesh that transfers livestock assets and
   skills to the poorest women. At baseline, the poorest women mostly
   engage in low return and seasonal casual wage labor while wealthier
   women solely engage in livestock rearing. The program enables poor women
   to start engaging in livestock rearing, increasing their aggregate labor
   supply and earnings. This leads to asset accumulation (livestock, land,
   and business assets) and poverty reduction, both sustained after four
   and seven years. These gains do not crowd out the livestock businesses
   of noneligible households while the wages these receive for casual jobs
   increase as the poor reduce their labor supply. Our results show that
   (i) the poor are able to take on the work activities of the nonpoor but
   face barriers to doing so, and, (ii) one-off interventions that remove
   these barriers lead to sustainable poverty reduction.

AB It is often argued that additional constraints on redistribution such as
   granting veto power to more players in society better protects property
   from expropriation. We use a model of multilateral bargaining to
   demonstrate that this intuition may be flawed. Increasing the number of
   veto players or raising the supermajority requirement for redistribution
   may reduce protection on the equilibrium path. The reason is the
   existence of two distinct mechanisms of property protection. One is
   formal constraints that allow individuals or groups to block any
   redistribution that is not in their favor. The other occurs in
   equilibrium where players without such powers protect each other from
   redistribution. Players without formal veto power anticipate that the
   expropriation of other similar players will ultimately hurt them and
   thus combine their influence to prevent redistributions. In a stable
   allocation, the society exhibits a class structure with class members
   having equal wealth and strategically protecting each other from
   redistribution.

AB We develop a new quantile-based panel data framework to study the nature
   of income persistence and the transmission of income shocks to
   consumption. Log-earnings are the sum of a general Markovian persistent
   component and a transitory innovation. The persistence of past shocks to
   earnings is allowed to vary according to the size and sign of the
   current shock. Consumption is modeled as an age-dependent nonlinear
   function of assets, unobservable tastes, and the two earnings
   components. We establish the nonparametric identification of the
   nonlinear earnings process and of the consumption policy rule.
   Exploiting the enhanced consumption and asset data in recent waves of
   the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that the earnings process
   features nonlinear persistence and conditional skewness. We confirm
   these results using population register data from Norway. We then show
   that the impact of earnings shocks varies substantially across earnings
   histories, and that this nonlinearity drives heterogeneous consumption
   responses. The framework provides new empirical measures of partial
   insurance in which the transmission of income shocks to consumption
   varies systematically with assets, the level of the shock, and the
   history of past shocks.

   Payoffs are continuous and single-peaked functions of the stopping time
   and stopping quantile. We show that if payoffs are hump-shaped in the
   quantile, then a sudden rush of players stops in any Nash or subgame
   perfect equilibrium.Fear relaxes the first mover advantage in
   pre-emption games, asking that the least quantile beat the average;
   greed relaxes the last mover advantage in wars of attrition, asking just
   that the last quantile payoff exceed the average. With greed, play is
   inefficiently late: an accelerating war of attrition starting at optimal
   time, followed by a rush. With fear, play is inefficiently early: a
   slowing pre-emption game, ending at the optimal time, preceded by a
   rush. The theory predicts the length, duration, and intensity of
   stopping, and the size and timing of rushes, and offers insights for

AB The theory of continuous time games (Simon and Stinchcombe (1989),
   Bergin and MacLeod (1993)) shows that continuous time interactions can
   generate very different equilibrium behavior than conventional discrete
   time interactions. We introduce new laboratory methods that allow us to
   eliminate natural inertia in subjects' decisions in continuous time
   experiments, thereby satisfying critical premises of the theory and
   enabling a first-time direct test. Applying these new methods to a
   simple timing game, we find strikingly large gaps in behavior between
   discrete and continuous time as the theory suggests. Reintroducing
   natural inertia into these games causes continuous time behavior to
   collapse to discrete time-like levels in some settings as predicted by
   subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. However, contra this prediction, the
   strength of this effect is fundamentally shaped by the severity of
   inertia: behavior tends towards discrete time benchmarks as inertia
   grows large and perfectly continuous time benchmarks as it falls towards
   zero. We provide evidence that these results are due to changes in the
   nature of strategic uncertainty as inertia approaches the continuous
   limit.

AB Can increased uncertainty about the future cause a contraction in output
   and its components? An identified uncertainty shock in the data causes
   significant declines in output, consumption, investment, and hours
   worked. Standard general-equilibrium models with flexible prices cannot
   reproduce this comovement. However, uncertainty shocks can easily
   generate comovement with countercyclical markups through sticky prices.
   Monetary policy plays a key role in offsetting the negative impact of
   uncertainty shocks during normal times. Higher uncertainty has even more
   negative effects if monetary policy can no longer perform its usual
   stabilizing function because of the zero lower bound. We calibrate our
   uncertainty shock process using fluctuations in implied stock market
   volatility, and show that the model with nominal price rigidity is
   consistent with empirical evidence from a structural vector
   autoregression. We argue that increased uncertainty about the future
   likely played a role in worsening the Great Recession. The economic
   mechanism we identify applies to a large set of shocks that change
   expectations of the future without changing current fundamentals.

AB This paper develops a theory of randomization tests under an approximate
   symmetry assumption. Randomization tests provide a general means of
   constructing tests that control size in finite samples whenever the
   distribution of the observed data exhibits symmetry under the null
   hypothesis. Here, by exhibits symmetry we mean that the distribution
   remains invariant under a group of transformations. In this paper, we
   provide conditions under which the same construction can be used to
   construct tests that asymptotically control the probability of a false
   rejection whenever the distribution of the observed data exhibits
   approximate symmetry in the sense that the limiting distribution of a
   function of the data exhibits symmetry under the null hypothesis. An
   important application of this idea is in settings where the data may be
   grouped into a fixed number of clusters with a large number of
   observations within each cluster. In such settings, we show that the
   distribution of the observed data satisfies our approximate symmetry
   requirement under weak assumptions. In particular, our results allow for
   the clusters to be heterogeneous and also have dependence not only
   within each cluster, but also across clusters. This approach enjoys
   several advantages over other approaches in these settings.

   but also link externalities. Players meet sequentially at random,
   myopically updating their links. Under mild assumptions, the network
   formation process is a potential game and converges to an exponential
   random graph model (ERGM), generating directed dense networks. I provide
   new identification results for ERGMs in large networks: if link
   externalities are nonnegative, the ERGM is asymptotically
   indistinguishable from an Erds-Renyi model with independent links. We
   can identify the parameters only when at least one of the externalities
   is negative and sufficiently large. However, the standard estimation
   methods for ERGMs can have exponentially slow convergence, even when the
   model has asymptotically independent links. I thus estimate parameters
   using a Bayesian MCMC method. When the parameters are identifiable, I
   show evidence that the estimation algorithm converges in almost

   measure expresses the marginal change in the seller's revenue under
   marginal changes in the rent paid to subsets of buyer types. As a
   corollary, we characterize the optimality of grand-bundling mechanisms,
   strengthening several results in the literature, where only sufficient
   optimality conditions have been derived. As an application, we show that
   the optimal mechanism for n independent uniform items each supported on
   [c,c+1] is a grand-bundling mechanism, as long as c is sufficiently
   large, extending Pavlov's result for two items Pavlov, 2011. At the same
   time, our characterization also implies that, for all c and for all

AB This paper develops characterizations of identified sets of structures
   and structural features for complete and incomplete models involving
   continuous or discrete variables. Multiple values of unobserved
   variables can be associated with particular combinations of observed
   variables. This can arise when there are multiple sources of
   heterogeneity, censored or discrete endogenous variables, or inequality
   restrictions on functions of observed and unobserved variables. The
   models generalize the class of incomplete instrumental variable (IV)
   models in which unobserved variables are single-valued functions of
   observed variables. Thus the models are referred to as generalized IV
   (GIV) models, but there are important cases in which instrumental
   variable restrictions play no significant role. Building on a definition
   of observational equivalence for incomplete models the development uses
   results from random set theory that guarantee that the characterizations
   deliver sharp bounds, thereby dispensing with the need for case-by-case
   proofs of sharpness. The use of random sets defined on the space of
   unobserved variables allows identification analysis under mean and
   quantile independence restrictions on the distributions of unobserved
   variables conditional on exogenous variables as well as under a full
   independence restriction. The results are used to develop sharp bounds
   on the distribution of valuations in an incomplete model of English
   auctions, improving on the pointwise bounds available until now.
   Application of many of the results of the paper requires no familiarity

AB We propose a novel methodology for evaluating the accuracy of numerical

   lower bound on the size of approximation errors. A small lower bound on
   errors is a necessary condition for accuracy: If a lower error bound is
   unacceptably large, then the actual approximation errors are even
   larger, and hence, the approximation is inaccurate. Our lower-bound
   error analysis is complementary to the conventional upper-error
   (worst-case) bound analysis, which provides a sufficient condition for
   accuracy. As an illustration of our methodology, we assess approximation
   in the first- and second-order perturbation solutions for two stylized
   models: a neoclassical growth model and a new Keynesian model. The
   errors are small for the former model but unacceptably large for the

AB Long-term structural changes to the American economy, such as the
   decline of labor unions, the era of deregulation, and the decline of
   commercial banking and concomitant rise of investment banking, have led
   to scholarly debate over the extent to which the American business class
   is politically unified. At the same time, the increasing globalization
   of economic activity over the last half century has generated similar
   academic disagreement regarding a potential transnational business class
   and its implications for national capitalist unity. In this article, I
   present evidence supporting the view that as of 2006, the corporate
   elite were relatively unified both within the United States and
   transnationally. Furthermore, I find that the network mechanisms that
   facilitate this unity are largely transnational, indicating a shift in
   center of corporate class organization and the interests likely
   represented by corporate political action in the 21st century.

AB This article, using fieldwork from a Chinese county, seeks to explain
   why Protestantism has experienced explosive growth in post-Mao China,
   but not before. It identifies six institutional features of Chinese
   Protestantism vital to the religion's rapid growth, but it does not make
   a simple institutional argument. Instead, it contends that each of these
   institutional features can facilitate or impede the spread of
   Protestantism depending on the context. Protestantism flourished in the
   post-Mao era because the Maoist state had dissolved the locally
   entrenched social/cultural resistance to Protestantism and because the
   post-Mao state's market-oriented economic reform created an environment
   conducive to the expansion of Protestantism. Theoretically, this article
   makes a claim that the effect of any religion's institutional features
   on its growth is contingent on the sociopolitical context of the
   religion, and that the state is the most powerful actor in creating and
   shaping that context.

AB Existing research highlights a lack of organizational basis for
   collective action in nondemocratic regimes. This study reevaluates this
   view by examining the distinct roles played by different organizations
   (embedded in distinct state-society relations) in different stages of
   collective action (occurrence and success) in rural China. With both
   quantitative and qualitative data, the authors study two types of
   organizations: (1) informal lineage groups and (2) semiautonomous civic
   associations, exemplified by seniors associations. The results
   demonstrate that lineage groups serve as mobilizing structures for
   collective resistance but face limited success given their informal
   status and weak vertical linkages with the state. By contrast, seniors
   associations, which maintain close relations with authorities while
   conserving a high degree of autonomy, act as a genuine intermediaries
   between the government and aggrieved citizens to suppress collective
   resistance. When collective action emerges, the associations can build
   on their legitimacy and vertical linkages to facilitate its success.

AB While the role of laws and regulations in structuring markets is well
   established, it is less understood how rule evasion affects the
   evolution of markets or how the interaction between regulators and the
   regulated about the meaning of compliance influences this effect. The
   authors study this issue by looking at the development of the
   asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market in France, Germany, and the
   Netherlands from 1999 to 2009. In all three countries, this market
   involved financial innovations designed to evade regulations. The
   authors identify diverging trends in the ABCP market that are a result
   of whether and how regulators were embedded in the different
   interpretive communities that defined regulatory compliance, such
   embeddedness being dependent on their discretionary and sanctioning
   power as well as their expertise. Focusing on these regulatory networks
   that embed institutions in markets, they propose a synthesis of
   relational and institutional accounts of the embeddedness of markets.

AB Institutional perspectives of globalization envision the homogenization
   of the world through global cultural, economic, and political dynamics,
   while glocalization theory highlights how local cultures may adapt or
   resist global forces. On the basis of these theories, the authors
   analyze when, where, and why local hybrid organizational forms emerge as
   a reaction to globalization. They suggest that the impact of
   globalization on the emergence and expansion of hybrid organizational
   forms, which reflect local adaptations of global forms, depends on three
   types of moderators: (1) the fit between global and local ideas, values,
   and practices; (2) the experience of the local community with
   alternative organizational forms; and (3) the motivation of the local
   community to adapt. The authors test their hypotheses with data from the
   high school education system in Turkey from 1985 to 2007, a period in
   which Turkey experienced the growing impact of globalization.

AB A new research agenda is proposed for assessing the strength of linkages
   between educational credentials, including fields of study, and
   occupational positions. The authors argue that a theoretically fruitful
   conception of linkage strength requires a focus on granular structure as
   well as the macroinstitutional characteristics of pathways between
   education and the labor market. Building on recent advances in the study
   of multigroup segregation, the authors find that Germany has stronger
   overall linkage strength than France or the United States. However, the
   extent to which the three countries differ varies substantially across
   educational levels and fields of study. The authors illustrate the
   substantive importance of the new approach by showing, first, that the
   standard organization space/qualification space distinction poorly
   describes the contemporary difference between Germany and France and,
   second, that relative mean occupational wages in Germany and the United
   States vary directly with the relative linkage strength for occupations
   in the two countries.

AB We conduct a randomized experiment that generates exogenous variation in
   the access to foreign markets for rug producers in Egypt. Combined with
   detailed survey data, we causally identify the impact of exporting on
   firm performance. Treatment firms report 16-26% higher profits and
   exhibit large improvements in quality alongside reductions in output per
   hour relative to control firms. These findings do not simply reflect
   firms being offered higher margins to manufacture high-quality products
   that take longer to produce. Instead, we find evidence of
   learning-by-exporting whereby exporting improves technical efficiency.
   First, treatment firms have higher productivity and quality after
   controlling for rug specifications. Second, when asked to produce an
   identical domestic rug using the same inputs and same capital equipment,
   treatment firms produce higher quality rugs despite no difference in
   production time. Third, treatment firms exhibit learning curves over
   time. Finally, we document knowledge transfers with quality increasing
   most along the specific dimensions that the knowledge pertained to.

AB We propose a new measure of the economic importance of each innovation.
   Our measure uses newly collected data on patents issued to U.S. firms in
   the 1926 to 2010 period, combined with the stock market response to news
   about patents. Our patent-level estimates of private economic value are
   positively related to the scientific value of these patents, as measured
   by the number of citations the patent receives in the future. Our new
   measure is associated with substantial growth, reallocation, and
   creative destruction, consistent with the predictions of Schumpeterian
   growth models. Aggregating our measure suggests that technological
   innovation accounts for significant medium-run fluctuations in aggregate
   economic growth and TFP. Our measure contains additional information
   relative to citation-weighted patent counts; the relation between our
   measure and firm growth is considerably stronger. Importantly, the
   degree of creative destruction that is associated with our measure is
   higher than previous estimates, confirming that it is a useful proxy for
   the private valuation of patents.

AB I analyze the behavior of risk premia in financial crises, wars, and
   recessions in an international panel spanning over 140 years and 14
   countries. I document that expected returns, or risk premia, increase
   substantially in financial crises, but not in the other episodes. Asset
   prices decline in all episodes, but the decline in financial crises is
   substantially larger than the decline in fundamentals so that expected
   returns going forward are large. However, drops in consumption and
   consumption volatility are fairly similar across financial crises and
   recessions and are largest during wars, so asset pricing models based on
   aggregate consumption have trouble matching these facts. Comparing
   crises to "deep" recessions strengthens these findings further. By
   disentangling financial crises from other bad macroeconomic times, the
   results suggest that financial crises are particularly important to
   understanding why risk premia vary. I discuss implications for theory
   more broadly and discuss both rational and behavioral models that are
   consistent with the facts. Theories where asset prices are related to
   the health of the financial sector appear particularly promising.

AB Sociologists study social inequality in all aspects of life, both
   locally and across the globe. Yet, they seldom examine their own house.
   The time has come for sociologists to take a hard look in the mirror, to
   be reflexive about how social inequality operates within our
   departments, within our professional organizations, and within our
   discipline. Race, gender, class, and sexual orientation, for example,
   matter in society as well as in our discipline. It could not be
   otherwise, as we, sociologists, carry the imprint of the social.
   Consciously and unconsciously, through our actions and inactions, we
   reproduce social inequalities in sociology despite our collective
   support for diversity and inclusion. This special section follows the
   town hall plenary at the 2016 American Sociological Association meetings
   in Seattle, Washington, calling for extended discussion and debate
   regarding the multiple ways in which social cleavages are reproduced in
   sociology. The contributors offer their thoughts on the most important
   issues currently facing sociology and what needs to happen moving
   forward.

AB Many analysts argue colorblindness as the reigning ideological buttress
   of a historically distinct form of structural white supremacy,
   color-blind racism. In contrast to slavery and legal segregation,
   color-blind racism is theorized as covert and highly institutionalized.
   As such, analyses of contemporary racial reproduction often emphasize
   the structure of colorblindness, particularly the habitual routines and
   discursive patterns of everyday white actors. Though invaluable, this
   work may conceal whites' innovation in reproducing, revising, and at
   times resisting white supremacy and corresponding logics. As opposed to
   focusing on the structural elements of colorblindness, I elevate
   colorblindness as a culturally recursive accomplishment grounded in an
   epistemology of ignorance-that is a process of knowing designed to
   produce not knowing surrounding white privilege and structural white
   supremacy. Qualitatively analyzing 105 family wealth analyses produced
   by white college undergraduates researching racial inequality and the
   wealth gap, I identify four epistemic maneuvers by which students
   creatively repaired a breach in normative colorblindness. Demonstrating
   innovative means by which ordinary whites bypass and mystify racial
   learning highlights their vested commitment to maintaining and
   creatively defending the ideologies that buttress racial domination and
   white supremacy. As such, this research additionally advises updating
   strategies for challenging whites' colorblindness in efforts to advance
   racial justice.

AB How do perceptions of the state shape social movements' strategies?
   Drawing on 16 months of participant observation and 70 interviews with
   activists in Arizona, this article illustrates how the politics of
   immigration plays out at the grassroots level as a struggle between
   expanding and restricting the state. Pro-immigrant activists in this
   study contended that the problem of undocumented migration resulted from
   the state's unchecked coercive power. Experiencing this strong-state
   effect, pro-immigrant activists' tactics focused on limiting the state's
   reach and reinforcing society's capacity to resist the state. Meanwhile,
   immigration restrictionist activists attributed the problem of
   undocumented immigration to the state's feebleness as a policing entity.
   In response to this weak-state effect, restrictionist tactics tried to
   expand the state's scope and build society's ability to aid the state.
   The article concludes by discussing how the strong/weak-state effect
   framework helps illuminate the field of social relations in which an
   activist group is embedded and provides an avenue for exploring the
   relationship between state practices and social movements.

   U.S. Census in a series of spatial regression models, I examine the
   distribution of a variety of health-related organizations across the
   United States. I find that the concentration and clustering of
   racial/ethnic minorities (blacks and, to a lesser extent, Latinos and
   Asians) in urban neighborhoods is inversely associated with the number
   of health-related organizations, including food resources, physical
   fitness facilities, health care resources, civic associations, and
   social service organizations. The spatial distribution of health-related

AB Street crime can easily agitate residents and cause distrust and
   division in integrated neighborhoods. How does this sensitive issue
   materialize in local politics? This article examines 25 years of
   electoral campaigning for the position of city council representative
   ("alderman") in two integrated Chicago neighborhoods. It reports three
   main findings. First, crime became and-at least in one
   neighborhood-remains a central issue in local electoral campaigning even
   as the crime rate continued to drop over the study period. Second, the
   politics of crime often spilled over into racial politics as candidates
   charged each other with inciting racial division or discounting
   legitimate fears. Third, despite nearly identical crime rates in the two
   neighborhoods, crime as a political issue eventually declined in one
   neighborhood, while remaining highly salient in the other. This finding
   suggests that neighborhood politics influence local discourse and
   produce divergent perceptions of crime. Implications for scholarship on
   the politics of crime and race, as well as urban neighborhoods, are
   discussed.

AB This article revisits a central tenet in the research on gay identity:
   namely, that industrial capitalism "created" gay identity and set the
   stage for the modern lesbian and gay movement in the United States.
   Although largely forgotten by social movement scholarship, I argue that
   this relationship continues. Specifically, different kinds of capitalism
   yielded different dominant understandings of gay identity held by the
   movement over its 70-year history: reform capitalism created a
   psychiatric gay identity; social contract capitalism created an "out"
   minority gay identity; capitalism-in-crisis created a decentered and
   contested gay identity; and neoliberal capitalism created a domesticated
   and consumerist gay identity. Rather than viewing gay identity and the
   movement through the prism of resources, opportunities, social networks,
   and social construction, the article argues that these processes are
   best subsumed under the broader rubric of capitalist political economy.

AB Using data from 53 in-depth interviews with undocumented immigrant young
   adults in Florida, we argue that undocumented legal status leads to a
   range of emotional challenges among this group. Lack of ontological
   security is at the core of emotions they must contend with, from
   frustration, fear, shame, and depression to anxiety about their future.
   Positive coping strategies include individually oriented activities such
   as listening to music, exercising, playing sports, attending church, and
   turning to close family members or friends for advice or compassion.
   Negative coping strategies often include behaviors that result in
   self-harm, including starving themselves, overeating, drinking, smoking,
   using drugs, and even ideating or attempting suicide. The most positive
   mechanism to foster well-being draws from social and emotional health
   generated by membership in immigrant advocacy organizations that provide
   opportunities for empowerment and belonging. Meaningful social
   connections result in positive emotional states, which in turn, provide
   young immigrants with emotional capital to aid in the process of
   resocialization, leading them to recast negative emotions into positive
   ones. We conclude with a discussion of conditions most conducive to the
   emotional well-being of undocumented immigrant young adults and factors
   that enhance emotional capital and contribute to greater well-being
   among this population.

AB The extent of environmental externalities associated with shale gas
   development (SGD) is important for welfare considerations and, to date,
   remains uncertain (Mason, Muehlenbachs, and Olmstead 2015; Hausman and
   Kellogg 2015). This paper takes a first step to address this gap in the
   literature. Our study examines whether shale gas development
   systematically impacts public drinking water quality in Pennsylvania, an
   area that has been an important part of the recent shale gas boom. We
   create a novel dataset from several unique sources of data that allows
   us to relate SGD to public drinking water quality through a gas well's
   proximity to community water system (CWS) groundwater source intake
   areas.1 We employ a difference-in-differences strategy that compares,
   for a given CWS, water quality after an increase in the number of
   drilled well pads to background levels of water quality in the
   geographic area as measured by the impact of more distant well pads. Our
   main estimate finds that drilling an additional well pad within 1 km of
   groundwater intake locations increases shale gas-related contaminants by
   1.5-2.7 percent, on average. These results are striking considering that
   our data are based on water sampling measurements taken after municipal
   treatment, and suggest that the health impacts of SGD 1 A CWS is defined
   as the subset of public water systems that supplies water to the same
   population year-round. through water contamination remains an open

   polluters are significantly more likely to be located near a state's

   results that are robust to a wide variety of model specifications and
   measurement strategies. This effect is particularly pronounced for

   important context of interpersonal influence: the household. We leverage
   a randomly assigned spillover experiment conducted in the United
   Kingdom, combined with a detailed database of pretreatment party
   preferences and public turnout records, to identify social influence
   within heterogeneous and homogeneous partisan households. Our results
   show that intrahousehold mobilization effects are larger as a result of
   campaign contact in heterogeneous than in homogeneous partisan
   households, and larger still when the partisan intensity of the message
   is exogenously increased, suggesting discussion rather than behavioral
   contagion as a mechanism. Our results qualify findings from influential

   negative correlations between political heterogeneity and electoral
   participation are unlikely to result from political disagreement.

   Several cross-country analyses report that natural resources have
   adverse effects on political institutions by increasing corruption,
   whereas other country-level studies show no evidence of such political
   resource curses. These studies face well-known endogeneity and other
   methodological issues, and employing micro-level data would allow for
   drawing stronger inferences. Hence, we connect 92,762 Afrobarometer
   survey respondents to spatial data on 496 industrial mines. Using a
   difference-in-differences strategy, we find that mining increases bribe
   payments, and this result is robust to using alternative models. Mines
   are initially located in less corrupt areas, but mining areas turn more
   corrupt after mines open. When exploring mechanisms, we find that local
   economic activity relates differently to corruption in mining and
   non-mining areas, suggesting that mining income incentivizes and enables
   local officials already present to require more bribes.

AB Active research on a wide range of political contexts centers on

   empirical work assesses it. Through a novel field experiment in a
   matched pair of villages in rural Uganda, this article directly examines
   word-of-mouth information spread and its relationship to ethnic
   diversity and networks. As expected, information spread more widely in
   the homogeneous village. However, unexpectedly, the more diverse
   village's network is significantly denser. Using unusually detailed
   network data, we offer an explanation for why network density may hamper
   information dissemination in heterogeneous areas, showing why even
   slight hesitation to share information with people from other groups can
   have large aggregate effects.

AB The observed rate of Americans voting for a different party across
   successive presidential elections has never been lower. This trend is
   largely explained by the clarity of party differences reducing
   indecision and ambivalence and increasing reliability in presidential
   voting. American National Election Studies (ANES) Times Series study
   data show that recent independent, less engaged voters perceive
   candidate differences as clearly as partisan, engaged voters of past
   elections and with declining rates of ambivalence, being undecided, and
   floating. Analysis of ANES inter-election panel studies shows the
   decline in switching is present among nonvoters too, as pure
   independents are as reliable in their party support as strong partisans
   of prior eras. These findings show parties benefit from the behavioral
   response of all Americans to polarization. By providing an ideological
   anchor to candidate evaluations, polarization produces a reliable base
   of party support that is less responsive to short-term forces.

AB For autocrats facing elections, officers in the internal security
   apparatus play a crucial role by engaging in coercion on behalf of the
   incumbent. Yet reliance on these officers introduces a principal-agent
   problem: Officers can shirk from the autocrat's demands. To solve this
   problem, autocrats strategically post officers to different areas based
   on an area's importance to the election and the expected loyalty of an
   individual officer, which is a function of the officer's expected
   benefits from the president winning reelection. Using a data set of
   8,000 local security appointments within Kenya in the 1990s, one of the
   first of its kind for any autocracy, I find that the president's
   coethnic officers were sent to, and the opposition's coethnic officers
   were kept away from, swing areas. This article demonstrates how state
   institutions from a country's previous authoritarian regime can persist
   despite the introduction of multi-party elections and thus prevent full
   democratization.

AB Politicians in developing countries misuse foreign aid to get reelected
   by fiscally manipulating foreign aid resources or domestic budgets. Our
   article suggests another mechanism that does not require politicians to
   have any control over foreign aid in order to make use of it for
   electoral purposes: undeserved credit claiming. We analyze the
   conditions under which local politicians can undeservedly take credit
   for the receipt of foreign aid and thereby boost their chances of
   reelection. We theorize that politicians can employ a variety of
   techniques to claim credit for development aid even when they have
   little or no influence on its actual allocation. Using a subnational
   World Bank development program in the Philippines, we demonstrate that
   credit claiming is an important strategy to exploit foreign aid inflows
   and that the political effects of aid can persist even when projects are
   designed to minimize the diversion or misuse of funds.

   distinctive characteristic. Moralized attitudes reorient behavior from
   maximizing gains to adhering to rules. Here, I examine a political
   consequence of this tendency. In three studies, I measure attitude
   moralization and examine how it relates to approval of political
   compromise. I find that moralized attitudes lead citizens to oppose
   compromises, punish compromising politicians, and forsake material
   gains. These patterns emerge on economic and noneconomic issues alike
   and identify a psychological phenomenon that contributes to intractable

AB Originally developed to explain cultural variation in moral judgments,
   moral foundations theory (MFT) has become widely adopted as a theory of
   political ideology. MFT posits that political attitudes are rooted in
   instinctual evaluations generated by innate psychological modules
   evolved to solve social dilemmas. If this is correct, moral foundations
   must be relatively stable dispositional traits, changes in moral
   foundations should systematically predict consequent changes in
   political orientations, and, at least in part, moral foundations must be
   heritable. We test these hypotheses and find substantial variability in
   individual-level moral foundations across time, and little evidence that
   these changes account for changes in political attitudes. We also find
   little evidence that moral foundations are heritable. These findings
   raise questions about the future of MFT as a theory of ideology.

   methodological techniques to test the influence of macro criminal
   justice policy on new admissions to federal prison via three mediators:
   case filings by federal prosecutors, conviction rates in federal
   district courts, and plea bargaining behavior. I find that cumulative
   Supreme Court rulings influence the incarceration rate by altering
   conviction rates in district courts; however, I find only mixed evidence
   of congressional and presidential influence. The results suggest that
   U.S. macro policy influences bureaucratic outputs by altering the
   behavior of subordinate policy implementers; however, the Supreme Court
   may enjoy an advantage in shaping criminal justice policy.

AB Rapid urbanization is among the major processes affecting the developing
   world. The influx of migrants to cities frequently provokes antagonism
   on the part of long-term residents, manifested in labor market
   discrimination, political nativism, and violence. We implemented a
   novel, face-to-face survey experiment on a representative sample of
   Mumbai's population to elucidate the causes of anti-migrant hostility.
   Our findings point to the centrality of material self-interest in the
   formation of native attitudes. Dominant group members fail to heed
   migrants' ethnic attributes, yet for minority group respondents,
   considerations of ethnicity and economic threat crosscut. We introduce a
   new political mechanism to explain this divergence. Minority communities
   facing persistent discrimination view in-migration by coethnics as a
   means of enlarging their demographic and electoral base, thereby
   achieving safety in numbers. Our article sheds light on the drivers of
   preferences over internal migration. It also contributes insights to the
   international immigration literature and to policy debates over urban
   expansion.

AB Spatially or temporally dense polling remains both difficult and
   expensive using existing survey methods. In response, there have been
   increasing efforts to approximate various survey measures using social
   media, but most of these approaches remain methodologically flawed. To
   remedy these flaws, this article combines 1,200 state-level polls during
   the 2012 presidential campaign with over 100 million state-located
   political tweets; models the polls as a function of the Twitter text
   using a new linear regularization feature-selection method; and shows
   via out-of-sample testing that when properly modeled, the Twitter-based
   measures track and to some degree predict opinion polls, and can be
   extended to unpolled states and potentially substate regions and subday
   timescales. An examination of the most predictive textual features
   reveals the topics and events associated with opinion shifts, sheds
   light on more general theories of partisan difference in attention and
   information processing, and may be of use for real-time campaign
   strategy.

   alone initially reduced crime and violence, but effects dissipated over

AB We study the role of family wealth for children's educational
   achievement using novel Swedish register data. In particular, we focus
   on the relationship between grandparents' wealth and their
   grandchildren's educational achievement. Doing so allows us to reliably
   establish the independent role of wealth in contributing to long-term
   inequalities in opportunity. We use regression models with extensive
   controls to account for observed socioeconomic characteristics of
   families, cousin fixed effects to net out potentially unobserved
   grandparent effects, and marginal structural models to account for
   endogenous selection. We find substantial associations between
   grandparents' wealth and their grandchildren's grade point averages
   (GPA) in the 9th grade that are only partly mediated by parents'
   socioeconomic characteristics and wealth. Our findings indicate that
   family wealth inequality-even in a comparatively egalitarian context
   like Sweden-has profound consequences for the distribution of
   opportunity across multiple generations. We posit that our estimates of
   the long-term consequences of wealth inequality may be conservative for
   nations other than Sweden, like the United States, where family
   wealth-in addition to its insurance and normative functions-allows the
   direct purchase of educational quality and access.

AB Media-based event data-i.e., data comprised from reporting by media
   outlets-are widely used in political science research. However, events
   of interest (e.g., strikes, protests, conflict) are often
   underreportedby these primary and secondary sources, producing
   incomplete data that risks inconsistency and bias in subsequent
   analysis. While general strategies exist to help ameliorate this bias,
   these methods do not make full use of the information oft en available
   to researchers. Specifically, much of the event data used in the social
   sciences is drawn from multiple, overlapping news sources (e.g., Agence
   France-Presse, Reuters). Therefore, we propose a novel maximum
   likelihood estimator that corrects for misclassification in data arising
   from multiple sources. In the most general formulation of our estimator,
   researchers can specify separate sets of predictors for the true-event
   model and each of the misclassification models characterizing whether a
   source fails to report on an event. As such, researchers are able to
   accurately test theories on both the causes of and reporting on an event
   of interest. Simulations evidence that our technique regularly
   outperforms current strategies that either neglect misclassification,
   the unique features of the data-generating process, or both. We also
   illustrate the utility of this method with a model of repression using
   the Social Conflict in Africa Database.

AB Why are some politicians guided by a sense of obligation toward
   international law but others are not? Why do some politicians have a
   social as opposed to an egoistic preference over compliance with
   international legal rules? Existing approaches largely assume that the
   structural features of the compliance environment shape preferences. As
   a result, they neglect the heterogeneity across decision makers'
   subjective beliefs in the legitimacy of international law, which is
   critical for explaining who exhibits a sense of obligation and has a
   non-egoistic preference for compliance. Drawing upon a large body of
   psychological research on social identity and influence, I argue that
   obligation toward international law has a behavioral foundation shaped
   by cosmopolitan social identity. Using data from an original survey of
   German politicians that includes two compliance experiments, I show that
   politicians with a high degree of cosmopolitanism are driven by a sense
   of legal obligation that results in a social preference for compliance
   while those low on cosmopolitanism lack the same sense of normative
   respect. Replicated in a second experimental study conducted with a
   convenience sample, my results indicate that strategic rationality in
   compliance applies, but only to a particular set of actors. By
   illuminating the psychological underpinnings of obligation toward
   international law, this study contributes to a richer understanding of
   compliance preferences and builds a bridge between instrumental and
   normative models.

AB If competing beliefs about political events in the world stem largely
   from information asymmetries, then more information and knowledge should
   reduce the gap in competing perceptions. Empirical studies of decision
   making, however, often find just the reverse: as knowledge and the
   stakes in play go up, the beliefs about what is happening polarize
   rather than converge. The theory proposed here attributes this to
   motivated reasoning. Emotions inside the observer shape beliefs along
   with information coming from the outside world. A series of experiments
   embedded in a national survey of Americans finds that a primary driver
   of the beliefs someone forms about globalization, other countries, and
   the politics in the Middle East is how strongly they attach their social
   identity to the United States. Attachment produces more intense positive
   and negative emotions that in turn shape the interpretation of unfolding
   events and lead norms to be applied in an inconsistent fashion. People,
   in effect, rewrite reality around their favored course of action,
   marrying the logic of appropriateness to their own preferences. Beliefs,
   consequently, are not independent of preferences but related to them.
   Motivated reasoning, while not consistent with rational models, is
   predictable and can lead to expensive mistakes and double standards that
   undermine liberal internationalism.
